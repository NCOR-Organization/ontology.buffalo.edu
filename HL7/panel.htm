Recent analyses of the  HL7 RIM, which forms the heart of the new Version 3 of HL7, have given rise to concerns  that this objective can not be achieved by means of the paradigm currently  proposed. In this panel, the floor is given to experts who, on the one hand are  involved in the development and implementation efforts of the HL7 RIM, and, on  the other hand, have published serious critiques both concerning problems with the  RIM itself, and also with its documentation. The panel will address the  question as to what extent these critiques have a sound basis and thus point to  serious defects in the HL7 V3 project, or whether they are, rather, based on  misinterpretations and misunderstandings. The panel will seek to conclude with an  agreement as to what actions should be taken in the immediate future in order to  remediate mutually acknowledged problems.</h4>

      <p align="left" class="StoryContentColor"><strong>General Description</strong><br />
  The Health Level 7 (HL7) Reference Information Model  (RIM) was introduced as an object oriented information model to harmonize the  definition of HL7 messages across different application domains. On the heels  of HL7&rsquo;s successful version 2, the new version 3, including the RIM, which  forms its centerpiece, has received significant attention, but it has in turn also  been subjected to criticism, which has addressed the following questions:</p>
      <div align="left">
        <ul>
          <li><span dir="ltr"><u>Questions about implementation</u></span>: The decision by HL7 to adopt the new RIM-based  methodology was adopted in 1996; have the promised benefits of interoperability  yet been realized? </li>
          <li><span dir="ltr"><u>Questions about the usability in specialist domains</u></span>: The RIM defines &lsquo;normative&rsquo; classes such as Act,  Role, Entity, etc. each of which is associated with a rich stock of attributes.  When the RIM is applied to each new domain (for example pharmacy, clinical  genomics), one then needs to select from these attributes. Does the RIM yield a  coherent basis for constructing well-designed software artifacts for functions  like the EHR or computerized decision support?</li>
          <li><span dir="ltr"><u>Questions about scope</u></span>: The RIM has a small number of &lsquo;foundation classes&rsquo;,  under which everything formulated in its terms must somehow fall. Of these,  &lsquo;Acts&rsquo; (roughly: actions which need to be described and communicated,  healthcare &lsquo;transactions&rsquo;) play a central role, so that only the class Entity  (defined as: &lsquo;A physical thing, group of physical things or an organization  capable of participating in Acts, while in a role&rsquo;) is left over for those  things which are not Acts. How, on this basis can the RIM deal transparently  with information about, say, disease processes, drug interactions, wounds,  accidents, bodily organs, and many other phenomena central to healthcare? </li>
          <li><span dir="ltr"><u>Questions about the documentation</u></span>: The he RIM is designed to serve as backbone of the  V3 methodology; unfortunately, documentation of the RIM appears to contain  numerous inconsistencies and/or incomplete definitions.. How, then, can the RIM  be used as reference information model by the many disparate communities it is  designed to serve?</li>
          <li><span dir="ltr"><u>Questions of learnability</u></span>: Can HL7 V3 be taught, and therefore engaged with and  used by a wider public, given what many people feel are a substantial number of  special cases, frequent amendments, and other complex hurdles that must be  overcome in creating a message? </li>
          <li><span dir="ltr"><u>Questions about marketing</u></span>: Are the&nbsp;  marketing claims made on behalf of V3 as &lsquo;the data standard for  biomedical informatics&rsquo; justifiable, given what seem to be many still  unresolved technical problems confronting those engaged in implementation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p align="left">Persons working closely with&nbsp; the HL7 RIM and V3 methodology acknowledge  the less-than-perfect quality of its documentation. However, they argue that  the formal and technical criticisms recently advanced, including criticisms of  the conceptual design of the RIM, are rooted in misunderstandings as to the  purpose and scope of the RIM and V3, and more importantly in fundamental  disagreements as to how a reference model for semantic and pragmatic  interoperability should be created. This panel is designed to move the debate  forward in the interests of both better understanding and of better tools to  meet the healthcare information needs of the future.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>PANEL STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION</strong><br />
        The panel will take the form of four brief  presentations, followed by a debate on the Future of HL7 chaired by Professor Don  Detmer and involving all panelists. The presentations will cover the following  topics:</p>
      <p align="left"><u><strong>Barry Smith: The  Ontological Analysis of HL7&rsquo;s Reference Information Model</strong></u><br />
      The  HL7 Version 3 is an ambitious attempt to address certain problems created  through the very successes of its predecessor Version 2: it is designed to  facilitate consistent sharing and usage of data across multiple local contexts.  The vision of HL7 V3 is to minimize the possibility for local dialects to be  formed by providing a normative repertoire of &lsquo;classes&rsquo; in terms of which all  healthcare messages would be defined. But what are the &lsquo;classes&rsquo; of which the  HL7 &lsquo;information model&rsquo; is comprised? In some places we are told that they are  information objects; in other places we are told that they are the entities in  reality to which such information objects refer. (So that persons, for example,  could be &lsquo;created in error&rsquo; and therefore &lsquo;nullified&rsquo; by being deleted from a  database.) We shall argue that this apparent confusion is not merely a product  of poor documentation, but that there is in fact no stable interpretation of &lsquo;class&rsquo;  in the RIM which will enable it to meet the goals it is designed to achieve. </p>
      <p align="left"><u><strong>Charlie Mead:&nbsp; The Role of the RIM and V3 in Computable  Semantic Interoperability</strong></u><br />
        The HL7 Reference Information Model is a cornerstone  of HL7&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate computable semantic interoperability in the  healthcare and clinical research domains.&nbsp;  In particular, the RIM &ndash; in concert with the overarching V3 methodology  &ndash; defines a collection of concepts, datatypes, attributes, and relationships  which collectively specify the cross-domain semantics of a set of &lsquo;common  structures.&rsquo;&nbsp; In order to express a  particular semantic utterance in a particular domain, RIM structures must be  bound to domain-specific terminologies and contexts.&nbsp; The resulting RIM-derived data structures  form the basis for both V3 &lsquo;messages&rsquo; (including the Clinical Data Architecture  specification) and application transactions (e.g. Oracle&rsquo;s Healthcare  Transaction Base uses the RIM to build its persistence layer.)&nbsp; The RIM and V3 are &lsquo;necessary but not  sufficient&rsquo; pieces in the overall solution of attaining computable semantic  interoperability (CSI).&nbsp; Dr. Mead will  discuss the application and scope of the RIM in the larger context of CSI. </p>
      <p align="left"><u><strong>Werner Ceusters: Referent  Tracking in HL7</strong></u><br />
        HL7 played an important pioneer role in recognizing  the need for a system of unique patient IDs as an indispensable part of any  Electronic Health Record system. The goal of referent tracking is to extend  this idea beyond the patient, to create an ever-growing pool of data relating  to other sorts of entities existing in concrete spatiotemporal reality and  relevant to patient care. In the context of EHRs the relevant concrete entities  are not only particular patients but also their parts, diseases, therapies,  lesions, and so forth, insofar as these are salient to diagnosis and treatment.  Within a referent tracking system, all such entities would be referred to  directly and explicitly. In this presentation, we will present our analysis of  the HL7 RIM in light of its capacity to deal with the requirements put forward  under this new paradigm.</p>
      <p align="left"><u><strong>Christopher G. Chute: HL7 RIM in the Context of US and International Standards </strong></u><br />
        The HL7 Reference Information Model represents the  most successful globally coordinated effort to evolve a shared model about the  health care process.&nbsp; It has demonstrated  substantial change over time, and no doubt will continue to evolve.&nbsp; Robust debate on its merits and gaps must be  welcomed, however this must be balanced with what has evolved and the profound  transformation that has occurred within standards organization who now  recognize more clearly the importance of high-level interoperability and  semantics.&nbsp; The RIM has had focused  thinking on these issues, and if properly engaged &ndash; will continue to do so.</p>
