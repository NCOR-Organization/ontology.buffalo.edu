<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>1. Introduction</span></b>
<br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>1.1 Two Dogmas of Reductionism</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Two persistent tendencies have made themselves
felt in the course of philosophical history. On the one hand is the Ockhamite
tendency, the tendency to embrace one or other of a small repertoire of
simplified ontologies<i>, </i>for example atomism or monism, together with a
view according to which more complicated entities are to be 'reduced' by one or
other means to the favoured class of simples. On the other hand is
Cartesianism, the tendency to embrace one or other foundationalist doctrine in
epistemology, or in other words to prize <i>episteme</i> at the expense of <i>doxa</i>.
The two tendencies reinforce each other mutually. Thus foundationalism tilts
the attention of philosophers in the direction of ontological simples, for it
is held that in relation to the latter knowledge secure against doubt is more
easily attainable. Philosophers are thus shielded from any concern with the
complex mesoscopic (medium-sized, middle-range, human-scale) objects of our everyday
environment and of the social world, since the latter is, after all, a realm of
mere opinion, not worthy of the attention of those striving after rigour.</span>
<br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Austrian philosophers have
been marked no less than philosophers in other traditions by both of these
tendencies. Brentano, especially, was an avowed foundationalist, a proponent of
psychological immanentism, and in his later philosophizing he embraced an
ontology according to which all objects must belong to the single category of
thing or substance. Husserl, similarly, argued that if knowledge of objects is
to be possible at all, then objects and knowing subjects must be made, in the
end, of the same (mind) stuff. Mach, familiarly, embraced an atomistic
('neutral') monism of 'elements', and both he and Brentano are strongly
influenced by the sceptical legacy of corpuscularism which led them to conceive
the common-sense world - of tables and beer, weddings and battles, orchestras
and armies - as a chimera, a product of <i>Falschnehmung</i> or of the lazy workings
of the 'economy of thought'. Both have serious difficulties in comprehending
holistic structures - and it is in this respect noteworthy that the Gestalt
movement, initiated by Christian von Ehrenfels with his classic paper &quot;On
'Gestalt-Qualities'&quot; of 1890, began as an attempt to craft out of Mach's
and Brentano's theories of sensation a workable account of our perception of
melodies and of other complex objects of experience.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>1.2 The
Psychological Environment</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Our topic here is social wholes, including very
complex social wholes such as the Sovereign Military Hospitaler Order of St.
John, the War of the Spanish Succession, the O. J. Simpson trial. Austrian
philosophers such as Mach, Wittgenstein, and Gustav Bergmann, who sought to
reconstruct the world out of simples - simple sense-data, simple substances,
bare particulars, basic universal properties - via a gluing together of
objectives, facts, sets, classes, circumstances, actualities, possibilities,
and what one will - were doomed to fail in the attempt to nail down
theoretically the sort of integrity that such wholes represent, since the
wholes in question are not the results of any logical (or physical, or
psychological) compounding. But they are real nonetheless, or so I shall argue.
The tradition of philosophizing inspired by Brentano, in contrast, included a
number of holistically inclined thinkers not wedded to logical or ontological
reductionism, and the present essay is in part a tale of the gradual rediscovery
of social objects, and of common-sense objects in general (complex objects in
the realm of non-apodictic experience), by philosophers in the wake of
Brentano, Ehrenfels and Husserl. Ehrenfels' confrontation with the problem of
complex wholes was continued by Meinong and his student Fritz Heider, by
Ehrenfels' student Max Wertheimer, by Bühler and Brunswik in Vienna, and then
by the great Gestalt theorists who gathered around Carl Stumpf in Berlin,
including not only Wertheimer but also Wolfgang Köhler, Kurt Koffka, and Kurt
Lewin. On becoming transplanted to America, Heider, Koffka and Lewin in their
turn influenced the ecological psychologists J. J. Gibson and Roger Barker,<sup><a
href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> and it is in the works of the latter that the beginnings
of a correct framework for the ontology social objects are finally to be found.</span>
<br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the then still
forceful influence of atomistic and immanentistic philosophies, Stumpf, the
early Husserl, Meinong and their contemporaries had seen their task as being
that of explaining how the <i>appearance</i> of complexity can arise on the
basis of mental simples. The external environment of the psychological subject
is for these philosophers a matter of mere construction. The later Gestaltists
turned their attentions more resolutely out into the world, which they
understood also in physical terms and in terms which recognized a genuine,
autonomous complexity of structure on the side of physical reality. When moving
to consider the environment of human behaviour and perception, however, they
fell victim to a view according to which this 'behavioural' or 'psychological
environment' would exist as a mere aspect of a relational whole encompassing
also the behaviour by which it is formed.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the problem at issue
it will be useful to quote the passage from Koffka in which the Gestaltist
distinction between the 'behavioural' (or mental) and 'geographic' (or
physical) environments is introduced:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>On
a winter evening amidst a driving snowstorm a man on horseback arrived at an
inn, happy to have reached shelter after hours of riding over the wind-swept
plain on which the blanket of snow had covered all paths and landmarks. The
landlord who came to the door viewed the stranger with surprise and asked him whence
he came. The man pointed in the direction straight away from the inn, whereupon
the landlord, in a tone of awe and wonder, said: &quot;Do you know that you
have ridden across the Lake of Constance?&quot; At which the rider dropped
stone dead at his feet.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what environment, then,
did the behaviour of the stranger take place? The Lake of Constance. Certainly
[... and it is] interesting for the geographer that this behaviour took place
in this particular locality. But not for the psychologist as the student of
behaviour [… For the latter] will have to say: There is a second sense to the
word environment according to which our horseman did not ride across the lake
at all, but across an ordinary snow-swept plain. His behaviour was a
riding-over-a-plain, but not a riding-over-a-lake. (Koffka 1935, pp. 27f.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>What
we experience, according to Gestaltists such as Koffka, are not objects in
physical reality (objects in the geographic environment). Rather, we
experience, precisely, <i>Gestalten, </i>created objects, which differ from
objects in physical reality <i>inter alia</i> because they arise through the
application of special Gestalt 'laws of organization'.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like their Brentanist
predecessors, therefore, the Gestaltists did not conceive the psychological
environment in realist terms, and they were consequently not able to come to a
coherent account of the relationship between this environment and the world of
physical things.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> Psychologists such as Lewin,
Heider and Brunswik, with their theories of the 'psychological environment',
also stopped short of full realism: the psychological environment is for them,
too, something that is dependent upon the ego, something that is present even
in dreams.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup></span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar confusions can be
found also in the later Husserl, whose <i>Ideas II </i>and <i>Crisis of
European Sciences</i> otherwise contain a series of masterly descriptions of
the features of the common-sense world.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> And
the same confusions are present in Scheler, too, whose theory of the 'milieu'
of practical life influenced Heidegger's writings on 'being-in-the-world':</span>
<br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The
&quot;things&quot; which are relevant to our acting, what we always refer to
when, for example, we trace certain deeds of human beings (or dispositions
towards such deeds) to their <i>&quot;milieu&quot;</i>, have of course not the
slightest to do either with Kant's &quot;thing in itself&quot; or with the
objects conceived by science (through the supposition of which science
&quot;explains&quot; natural facts). The sun of the milieu of human beings is
not the sun of astronomy. The meat that is stolen, bought, or what have you, is
not a sum of cells and tissues with the chemicophysical processes which take
place within them. The sun of the milieu is different at the North Pole, in moderate
zones, and at the equator, and its beams are felt as different beams. … There
is much that &quot;effects&quot; me objectively - for instance, electrical and
magnetic currents, rays of many sorts that I do not sense, etc., - which
certainly does not belong to my &quot;milieu&quot; … <i>Only that which I
effectively experience belongs thereto. </i>(Scheler 1954, p. 158f., Eng.
trans., p. 139)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The
problem with this passage is clear. As schoolboys with microscopes know, meat
that is stolen and bought does most certainly possess cells and tissues which
undergo chemicophysical properties. The sun that is experienced at the North
Pole is most certainly the same sun as the sun that is experienced at the
Equator. It cannot, therefore, be the case that the things in our practical,
commonsensical environment have 'not the slightest' to do with the objects
conceived by science. But Scheler goes on:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>These
things are, rather, in some sense intermediate between persons and the reality
that is studied by physics: The &quot;sun of the milieu&quot; has as little to
do with the sun of astronomy as it has to do with the
&quot;representation&quot; and the &quot;perception of the sun&quot;. A
&quot;milieu-thing&quot; belongs to an <i>&quot;intermediate realm&quot;</i>
lying between our perceptual content and its objects on the one hand and those
objectively thought objects on the other. (Scheler 1954, p. 159, Eng. trans. p.
140)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>1.3
Uexküll's Constructivist Biology</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Scheler's talk of intermediate realms recalls
the constructivist biology of Jakob von Uexküll, of which Scheler was aware.
Uexküll, too, embraced an ontology of <i>milieux</i> or 'environments' (<i>Umwelten</i>)
as intermediary entities which would somehow exist in a realm between the
animal and the exterior realm of physics. Every animal, Uexküll held, is the <i>creator</i>
of its own 'external reality', of an <i>Umwelt</i>, that is constructed by the
organism for its own needs. The 'first principle of <i>Umwelt</i> theory' reads
as follows :</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>all
animals, from the simplest to the most complex, are fitted into their unique
worlds with equal completeness. A simple world corresponds to a simple animal,
a well-articulated world to a complex one. (1957, p. 10)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>On
the one hand, these created realities are seen as separated off from each other
in the manner of Leibnizian monads (Uexküll himself refers to them as 'soap
bubbles'<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup>). On the other hand, however, they
are held to be capable of interacting, though the explanation we are offered of
this interaction is difficult to understand. The eye, we are told 'throws' the
picture that is produced on its retina out of itself into the visual space
surrounding the animal. 'If the eye did not have this capacity, the dragonfly
would not be able to catch a midge in flight. … Sounds, smells, tastes, and
touch are all transposed out of the body and into the subjective space of the
animal'. (Jennings 1909, p. 333)</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Uexküll is reported
to have arrived at this doctrine when, on looking up at a beech tree in the
Heidelberg woods, he came to the realization that:</span> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>This
is not <i>a</i> beech tree, but rather <i>my </i>beech tree, something that I,
with my sensations, have constructed in all its details. Everything that I see,
hear, smell or feel are not qualities that exclusively belong to the beech, but
rather are characteristics of my sense organs that I project outside of myself.
(Schmidt 1980, p. 10, cited in Harrington 1996, p. 41)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>As
Uexküll formulated the matter in his <i>Theoretical Biology </i>(1928, p. 2):
'All reality is subjective appearance - this must serve as the fundamental
insight of biology, too.'</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kantian flavour of
Uexküll's thinking becomes especially clear in a letter to Houston Stewart
Chamberlain of 1923 on the opposition between what Uexküll calls the 'intuitive
space [<i>Anschauungsraum</i>]' of the animal environment and the 'space of
representations' [<i>Vorstellungsraum</i>] of science. The latter, Uexküll
holds, forfeits any claim on reality. 'Intuitive space alone is real.'<sup><a
href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup></span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>We
are indeed capable of building a space of representations, in which the suns
and stars move at incredible distances and in inconceivable time. But this
space of representations is just a watering-down of our intuitive space, that
we gain by allowing several important elements of this intuitive space to fall
away. …</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>… I am afraid that
if I publicly proclaim this perspective, that they will treat me à la Galileo,
and either lock me up in a madhouse or else ridicule me as an arch-reactionary.</span>
</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>However I must just
once say my piece. Perhaps no one will understand me. Nevertheless, it remains
a fact: <i>&quot;Eppur non si muove.&quot; </i>I do not move around the sun,
but rather the sun rises and sets in my arch of the sky. It is always another
sun, always a new space in which it moves. (Cited in Harrington 1996, pp. 46f.
Translation corrected.)</span> <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Or
in further Kantian vein: 'Space owes its existence to the inner organization of
the human subject, who clothes the sense qualities in spatial form.' (Uexküll
1928, p. 4) Or again:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>In
the eye of the naive person only the one world of appearances is visible,
which, surrounded by space and time, is full of sounding, smelling, coloured
things. Scientific research seeks to influence this naive world view from two
opposing sides. Physical theory seeks to convince the naive person that the world
he sees is full of subjective illusions, and that the one real world is much
poorer, since it consists merely in an immense and eternal swirling dance of
atoms unfurling itself in purely causal fashion. Biological theory, in
contrast, seeks to draw to the attention of the naive person the fact that he
sees much too little, and that the real world is much richer than he suspects
because there is spread out around every living thing its own world of
appearance, which is like his world in its basic traits but which nonetheless
manifests so many variations that he could devote his whole life to the study
of these worlds without there ever being an end in sight …. And when once we
have made a beginning in showing in regard to a few animals what environments surround
them like solid but invisible glass houses, then we will soon be able to people
the world around us with numberless other shimmering worlds, which will
intensify the riches of our world a further thousandfold. In this way biology
offers to the naive man an unlimited enrichment of his world, while the
physicist makes of him a beggar. (Uexküll 1928, p. 62)</span></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>1.4 Ecological
Realism</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The central problem with the work of Scheler,
Uexküll and the Gestalists as an account of the animal-environment relation is that
it seems to rule out the fact of an environment common to animals of different
species (and thus to render inexplicable the fact of the fly's becoming eaten
by the salamander). This problem is close to being resolved in the work of
Gibson and Barker. Here we have a new phase in the treatment of our problem, a
phase in which the external environment is at last given its due. To a much
greater degree than is manifest in even the most radical Gestaltist writings,
Gibson and Barker emphasize the fact that psychological experience is to be
understood not in terms of a succession of two-term relations between acts and
more or less coherently integrated objects in some special &quot;realm&quot;,
but rather in terms of a <i>topological nesting,</i> whereby the sentient
organism is housed or situated within (serves in a certain sense as the
interior boundary of) a surrounding environment in such a way that its
perceptions and actions are to be understood theoretically only as occurring
within this surrounding framework. At the same time the latter is understood
not in psychological terms but as something that falls squarely within the
realm of physics. Moreover, our successive environments are seen as containing
lakes, chairs, tables, salamanders, sandy beaches, and X-ray tomography
machines even independently of specific beliefs about these environments which
we might hold on given occasions.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both perception and
action, from the Gibson-Barker point of view, we are embrangled with the very
things themselves in the surrounding world, and not, for example, with 'sense
data' or 'representations' or 'noemata'. Perceptions, like actions, are
achievements of purposeful creatures. Hence perception is not a matter of the
processing of sensations. Rather it is a direct acquisition of complex
information about objects in the environment, information which is acquired
because the perceiver, in his active looking, touching, tasting, feeling, is
bound up with those very objects - the crumpled shirt, the empty glass, the
broken spear - which are relevant to his life and to his tasks of the moment.<sup><a
href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gibson and Barker, as will
become clear, embrace a radically externalistic view of mind and action. We
have not a Cartesian mind or soul, with its interior theatre of 'contents' or
'representations' or 'beliefs and desires' and a consequent problem - which had
plagued the work of Brentano and his first-generation followers - of explaining
how this mind or soul can succeed, via intentionality, in grasping objects external
to itself. Rather, we have a perceiving, acting organism, whose perceptions and
actions are always already inextricably intertwingled with the parts and
moments, the things and surfaces, of its external environment.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Gibson nor Barker, however,
were able to attain the sort of ontological sophistication in their accounts of
this embeddedness-relation of organism and niche that we find in the best
ontological writings of Brentano, Husserl or Ingarden, and nor did they have at
their disposal the modern formal-ontological tools which would seem to be most
appropriate for dealing systematically with holistic phenomena of the sort in
question. The present essay is thus a first step towards rectifying these
inadequacies by bringing the ideas of the ecological psychologists into a form
where we can apply some of the ontological lessons we have learned, above all
from recent work on mereology and mereotopology in the spirit of Husserl's
third Logical Investigation.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></span> <br>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2. A Bicategorial
Ontology</span></b> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2.1 Continuants and Occurrents</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>How are we to do justice ontologically to the
fact of complexity? How, more specifically, do separate persons, such as you
and me, become joined together into social wholes of different types - committees,
teams, battalions, meetings, conversations, jousts? To answer this question we
need to distinguish, first of all, two categories of object - continuants and
occurrents - which serve in a certain sense as the building blocks of
common-sense reality. Continuants are such as to endure self-identically
through time. They continue to exist from moment to moment and from day to day.
Examples of continuants would include, in the first place: you and me, my pet
rock, the planet Earth, and, from the instant of its formation to the instant
it hits the ground: a raindrop. The family of continuants thus includes what
are called 'substances' in the Aristotelian terminology (also sometimes called
'things' or 'bodies' or 'extended spatial magnitudes'). But it includes also
entities of other sorts: for instance media (bodies of air and water).
Occurrents (which include 'accidents' in Aristotelian usage , and which include
also what in more recent terminology are sometimes called events or processes
or states) occur or happen <i>in </i>time.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
Examples of occurrents would include: whistles, blushes, speakings, runnings,
my present headache, your knowledge of French.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuants take up space and
have spatial parts. Occurrents such as blushes, funeral marches, forest fires,
too, may be spatially extended, but the spatial extendedness and spatial
locatedness of occurrents in common-sense reality is in every case parasitic
upon the extendedness and locatedness of the continuants which are their
bearers.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A continuant is
self-identical from the beginning to the end of its existence. John as child is
identical to John as adult, even though he may have changed in many ways in the
intervening years. A continuant accordingly has no temporal parts: the first
ten years of my life are a part of my <i>life</i> (a large, complex,
many-phased occurrent) and not a part of <i>me.</i> It is not continuants but
occurrents that can have temporal parts: indeed it is as if the mode of
existing of an occurrent is precisely to unfold itself in time. The parts of an
occurrent include its successive phases. The parts of a continuant, in
contrast, are its arms and legs, its organs and cells. In fact, there are a
number of deep-rooted analogues between the part-whole structures of
continuants in space and of occurrents in time.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>
Both continuants and occurrents often manifest a many-levelled hierarchical or
assembly structure: a person is made of atoms which combine together to form
cells which combine together to form organs which combine together to form the
person himself. A tennis-match is made of volleys which combine together to
form games which combine together to form sets which combine together to form
the match itself.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where continuants can exist
on their own, occurrents require a support from continuants in order to exist.
The latter are the <i>bearers</i> or <i>carriers</i> of the former. More
precisely, continuants and occurrents are linked together via the formal tie of
specific dependence, which is defined as follows:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>x
is specifically dependent on y =df. (1) x and y share no parts in common, and
(2) x is necessarily such that it cannot exist unless y exists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>My
headache, for example, is specifically dependent on me. An occurrent stands to
a continuant in the formal tie of one-sided specific dependence only. (Thus it
is clear that I am not specifically dependent on my headache.) There are also,
however, cases where objects are bound together via ties of <i>mutual</i>
specific dependence; consider for example the relation between John the husband
and Mary the wife, or between the north and south poles of a magnet, or between
the pitch, timbre and loudness of a musical tone.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup>
Equally, there are cases where an object stands in a relation of specific
dependence to more than one object simultaneously. Thus in particular there are
relational occurrents - such as kisses and hits, handshakes and conversations -
which join one continuant to another in more or less enduring fashion. Certain
special types of relational occurrents, called by Husserl 'moments of unity'
(1900/01, Eng. trans. p. 442), are responsible for uniting together pluralities
of separate continuants into single unitary collectives (such as flocks of
geese or shoals of fish).</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuants and occurrents
form two distinct orders of being which have, both separately and together,
played a predominant role in the history of ontology. Some, such as Aristotle and
Ingarden, embraced bicategorial ontologies in which a place is found for both.
More commonly however, as in the case of Mach and Brentano, Whitehead and
Kotarbiski, monocategorial ontologies were developed in which one or other of
the two categories was eliminated or reduced in favour of the other. Here, in
contrast, we shall demonstrate the necessity to develop an ontology in which
room is allotted also to objects of other types, in addition to continuants,
occurrents and their parts and collectives. Above all, we argue, there are
social wholes which transcend the boundary between the two.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2.2 Complex
Occurrents</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Both continuants and occurrents may form
collectives. Teams, families, nations are examples of collective continuants;
meetings, arguments, wars examples of collective occurrents. We note in passing
that the problem of integrity arises in a different form in relation to
collective occurrents, since occurrents may form collectives in two-fold
fashion: via simultaneous compounding, as for example in the case of a musical
chord or a pattern of colour, and via sequencing in time, as in the case of a
melody or film sequence.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occurrents can manifest a
complex unity of diverse constituents, as is clear already from our everyday
perceptual experiences. As Ehrenfels points out:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Examples
such as the presentation of wetness, in which both the senses of pressure and
of temperature seem to be equally involved, or those total impressions which we
imprecisely designate as the tastes of the respective dishes but which clearly
involve also sensations of pressure, temperature and smell, as well as other,
similar examples, indicate that if we are to recognize Gestalt qualities at all
in these spheres, then, in virtue of the high degree of unity of the given
presentational complexes, we must also accept the possibility of <i>Gestalt
qualities comprehending complexes of elements of different categories</i>.
(Ehrenfels 1890, Eng. trans. p. 97, emphasis added)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Some
complex collectives of occurrents (for example a stage performance of a Wagner
opera) are occurrents which depend on collectives of continuants. The
performance of an opera is an immensely complex sequence of complex relational
occurrents inhering, <i>inter alia,</i> in the singers and members of the
orchestra as well as in the stage and its props. As Ehrenfels also saw, many of
the most impressive achievements of human creativity consist in finding new
ways or patterns in which simple occurrents can become compounded together to
form complex occurrents - Ehrenfels called them 'Gestalt qualities' - which are
then more than (or different from) the sums of their putative simple parts.
Complex occurrents such as opera performances enjoy a<i> </i>complexity which
embraces constituents drawn from widely diverse material domains. Already an
act of promising manifests a complexity of this sort, embracing constituents of
a linguistic, psychological, quasi-legal and quasi-ethical sort, as well as
more narrowly physical constituents of different types (including vibrations in
the air and ear and associated electrical and chemical events in the brain).</span>
</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2.3 Complex
Continuants</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Non-collective continuants may enjoy a natural
integrity, as in the case of animals, planets, raindrops. Each of these objects
is such as to enjoy a certain completeness or rounded-offness, being neither
too small nor too large, in contrast both to their undetached parts (my arms,
your legs) and to arbitrary heaps or aggregates: they have complete, connected
boundaries and are movable relative to other objects in the world.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuants may also,
however, come to be joined together in such a way as to form more or less
complex, more or less integrated wholes which are genuine constituents of the
furniture of the world. At one extreme we have artefactual assemblies such as
Meinong's typewriter or Theseus's ship.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> In
the middle range we have quasi-unitary collectives which fall short of both
complete integrity (they are easily decomposed) and complete separateness (they
are not easily translocated). Examples are: sandy beaches, river deltas, clumps
of trees, mountain ranges. At the other extreme we have examples of the type
with which we are here primarily concerned, namely <i>social wholes, </i>a
richly variegated category which includes not only families and tribes, nations
and empires, but also orchestras and chess clubs, battalions and football
teams, as well as those more or less short-lived social groupings which arise
when strangers are formally introduced, or pair up on the dance floor.<sup><a
href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup> These examples inherit some, if not all, of the
ontological marks of their non-collective counterparts. They can undergo
changes through time. They have a unity which is something like the unity of a
living thing. They have no temporal parts (the parts of Poland are Silesia and
Galicia, not: Poland under the reign of Sigismund III, Poland in the Era of
Partition, and so on). They take up space; and as a thing may be cleaved into
thingly parts, so - as Czechs and Slovaks know - a social whole can in certain
cases come to be divided into separate sub-collectives. And while collective
continuants are, like their non-collective counterparts, self-identical from
the beginning to the end of their existence, this existence, as the examples of
Israel and Poland show, may be intermittent. And as the case of Austria shows,
social wholes may be merged for a time into, and subsequently cleaved apart
from, other social collectives.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Social objects constitute a
new dimension of being within the common-sense world, analogous to the level of
persons proper. Institutions have their own lives, they endure through time,
despite acquiring or losing members; they have their own qualities and states,
and their own ways of functioning in collaboration or in interaction with each
other. And like things on lower levels, they are through and through dependent
on circumstances and are subject to more and less regular and intelligible
patterns of change. The Hungarian nobility has existed for many centuries and
it will continue to exist for some time in the future. Collective continuants
are thus to be distinguished from <i>sets</i>, as the mathematician conceives
them, as also from arbitrary aggregates or pluralities. They are examples of
unities which are to a degree able to survive changes even in the stock of
their members or participants.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2.4 Fiat Objects</span>
<br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Social objects such as juries, courts,
contracts, lawsuits are, as judges know, parts of reality. But as was stressed
by Brentano's student Anton Marty, they also manifest some features which are
normally associated with objects in the domain of abstracta or irrealia.<sup><a
href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup> To be real, according to Marty, is to enter into
causal relations. The existence in time of a real object typically involves
continuous and manifold changes reflecting the manifold of causal relations in
which it is involved. The existence in time of a social collective, in
contrast, may for long periods involve no change at all, and even where a
social collective is subject to change, this will typically consist merely in
discrete changes (not least the coming into and then going out of existence) as
a reflection of certain specific changes in the real (including changes in
charters, covenants, treaties, contracts and the like). This feature of
relative isolation from the concrete, causal-energetic sphere is manifested by
dependent social objects such as claims, obligations, rights, debts,
knighthoods, relations of ownership and authority, as well as by cultural
artefacts such as works of music and literature.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the latter is
'something which, when it comes into existence, is not brought about as an
effect and when it goes out of existence does not do so directly in consequence
of the ceasing of an effect.' (Marty 1908, p. 321) Non-real objects, according
to Marty, have no history of change in their own right; but nor do they stand
outside history: the social collective which is the <i>natio hungarica</i>
begins to exist with the creation of the first Magyar noble and ceases to exist
when the last Magyar noble dies. The State of Montana begins to exist with a
certain declaratory act in Washington in 1890, and ceases to exist with the
dropping on America of the first cyclotromic bomb by the Belgian Empire in the
year 2084. (One is reminded, here, of Leibniz's conception of aggregates as
non-real <i>phaenomena bene fundata</i> which belong neither among the
substances nor among the accidents.) Social objects have realia as parts, but
they are, as it were, relatively (causally) isolated from these parts, being
affected only by those changes in the latter which are such as to bring about
the destruction of the collective also.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One might now be tempted,
with Marty, to impose a two-layer structure on the realm of continuants: on the
lower layer would be real things, subject to continuous changes and causal
interactions. On the upper ('supervenient') layer would be non-real collectives
which float, as it were, above the level of the real.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>
The problem with this view is that it leaves no room for the interactions
between the two levels, for the ways in which our thingly, causal-energetic
behaviour is constrained - in a manner to be described more closely below -
through our participation in social collectives and other sorts of
institutions. Certainly Marty is correct to draw our attention to the fact that
many social objects are the products of fiat (this is one grain of truth in
contractarian doctrines in political science as also in accounts of legal and
political phenomena based on the theory of speech acts<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>).
Thus many social objects come into being fully formed as the result of legal
enactments, of handshakes, of contracts, of affirmations. But how are we to
reconcile this aspect of objects in the social realm with their capacity to
constrain behaviour?</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>2.5 Generic
Dependence</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Just as non-collective continuants may gain and
lose parts (as Tibbles gains and loses molecules), so collective continuants may
gain and lose members, and they may undergo other sorts of changes through time
while still retaining their identity. Towns, cities, universities, and
corporate bodies generally, manifest the ability to sustain themselves through
time even though they are subject to a certain turnover of their constituent
continuants. They can continue to exist even while some of their participants
are removed and others take their places. In addition there are dependent
objects which have continuants or collective wholes as their bearers or
carriers but which may survive replacement of these bearers. Languages,
religions, legal systems and many other sorts of institutions do not depend for
their existence upon <i>specific</i> individuals or groups; rather, they depend
generically on the existence of individuals or groups fulfilling certain
necessary roles.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To capture the sense in which
an institutional object is dependent upon a continuant, we need to introduce
the notion of generic dependence, which can be defined, in first approximation,
as follows:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>x
is generically dependent on objects of sort S =df. x is necessarily such that
it cannot exist unless some object of sort S exists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A
dog owner is in this sense dependent upon a dog; a king is dependent upon his
subjects - but not on any specific dog, or subjects. A language, religion or
legal system is in the same sense generically dependent on the individuals and
groups who serve, in their actions, to instantiate the corresponding rules,
beliefs and customs. This sort of generic dependence is, as we shall see,
characteristic of social objects of many different types.</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3. The Ontology
of the Common-Sense World</span></b> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.1 The Theory of Physical-Behavioural Units</span>
<br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Social objects exist in that mesoscopic stratum
of reality which we call the common-sense world. They thus fall outside the
purview of physics as narrowly understood. The common-sense world is a world in
which people work, converse, judge, evaluate; a world of animals, tables,
clothes, food; of sweet and bitter, red and green, hot and cold. The
common-sense world is above all a world of <i>things </i>which we put to use
for various practical purposes, things which exist always <i>in situ</i>, which
is to say: in an environment of other real things.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to things, the
common-sense world comprehends also holes, the gaps between things, and the
media (for example water, smoke) in which things move,<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>
as well as shadows, rainbows, tides, and similar phenomena. But within this
extended array of things and media there are also further discriminable areas
of organization which cross-cut each other on a number of distinct dimensions.
The world is organized into separate things or bodies, but it is also organized
into overlapping social and institutional zones or contexts within which human
beings figure as participants. It is not as if we have persons on one side and
thingly contexts on the other, with a gulf between them that is bridged via
'intentionality'. Rather, we can now assert, persons themselves, and things in
the spatial environment, are both equally caught up within entities of a new,
over-arching type, which the ecological psychologist Barker calls <i>physical-behavioural
units. </i>It is these which serve as the successive environments of persons
and groups of persons as they go about their various activities from day to
day.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of
physical-behavioural units of the type favoured by Barker - who was one of
Lewin's first assistants at the Iowa Child Welfare Station - are: Wendy's Friday
afternoon class, Jim's meeting with his teacher, your Thursday lunch, Frank's
early morning swim. Such physical-behavioural units may repeat themselves (may
exist in many copies). They</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>are
common phenomenal entities, and they are natural units in no way imposed by an
investigator. To laymen they are as objective as rivers and forests - <i>they
are parts of the objective environment that are experienced directly as rain
and sandy beaches are experienced</i>. (Barker 1968, p. 11, emphasis added)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Barker
insists that physical-behavioural units are <i>parts of reality</i>. They are
of inestimable importance for an understanding of human cognition and action,
since <i>almost all human behaviour occurs within one</i>. All roles are played
within behaviour settings. All organizations are composed of them. All
biographies are ordered in terms of them. Human beings are determined through
and through by the behaviour settings in which they participate, exactly as
non-human-animals are determined through and through by the ecological niches
into which they have evolved. Even our journeys from site to site, and our
loungings in daydream mode between quests, are recognizable as
physical-behavioural units in Barker's terms. Even our more or less
unsuccessful <i>attempts</i> to engage in standard activities can be understand
for what they are only in terms of an independent prevalence of
physical-behavioural units of the corresponding, full-fledged type, for it is
only in relation to the latter that our attempts are determined as attempts and
our successes distinguished from our failures. The behaviour settings in which
we constantly find ourselves are, it must be admitted, to a degree porous, in
virtue of the fact that we may sometimes switch effective context from moment
to moment as our attention is distracted now by one thing or person, now by
another. This does not, however, detract either from their reality or from
their salience and their virtual all-pervasiveness in our lives as human
beings. Only in rare moments of total disorientation do we seem to be set free
of all behaviour settings, but this is just to imply that it is in relation to
settings that we are in normal cases oriented.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.2 Prehistory of
Physical-Behavioural Units</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Leaving aside Heidegger, and leaving aside the
French existentialists such as Sartre and Merleau-Ponty (with their work on
'projects' and the like, work which was inspired by Lewin and other
Gestaltists), serious investigations of physical-behavioural units by
philosophers are almost unknown. Husserl's theory of the<i> </i>'life world' is
a first, informal approximation to an ontological theory of the requisite sort.
But Husserl, too, stops short of any full realist commitment to what he calls
the 'surrounding environment', and the relation of the latter to physical
things in space is never clarified.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The neglect of
physical-behavioural units in the literature of philosophy turns first of all
on the already mentioned tendency among philosophers to sanction the dominance
of simplified ontologies, above all ontologies based on continuants or
occurrents as sole admissible categories, and on their tendency to embrace one
or other form of ontological monism. For physical-behavioural units, as will by
now be clear, are radically transcategorial: they transcend the boundary between
the two categories of continuant and occurrent. And because they can be fitted
neatly into neither of the two orders of being, they have been neglected in the
tradition of ontology. Even those philosophers with the ambition to come to
grips with the realm of common sense to end up with philosophies which reduce
this realm - for example on the pattern of the Wittgensteinian doctrine of
'language games' - to objects of a suitably monistic flavour. In fact, however,
language, too, is a phenomenon which can be coherently explained only within
the framework of an ontological theory of physical-behavioural units, since
where language gets used, under all normal circumstances, such usage is itself
such as constitute a physical-behavioural unit. To explain human common-sense
reality in terms of language is to explain the whole in terms of a relatively
late-developed part. It is also to forestall any mutually beneficial
interaction between our understanding of this reality and our knowledge of
human beings as biological creatures.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The neglect of
physical-behavioural units turns secondly on the fact that they are objects of
a holistic nature, of a sort to be treated by instruments such as those of
mereotopology, and thus they are, again, alien to the world-view of
contemporary philosophers who have been inspired by ideas based on predicate
logic and set theory as instruments of ontology. The formal ontology of
settings, niches, or physical behavioural units is thus far completely
undeveloped, in spite of the degree to which recent work in analytic
metaphysics has been marked by an increasing readiness to admit into its
categorial systems objects - such as artefacts, actual and possible worlds,
moments, tropes and individualized properties - which were for a long time out
of favour.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the neglect of
physical-behavioural units turns finally on the dominance of foundationalist
ideas among philosophers through the ages: for physical-behavioural units - my
evening soup, your Tuesday swim - belong <i>par excellence</i> to the realm of
mere opinion. Hence, erroneously, it has been concluded either that the given
objects are not amenable to rigorous treatment, whether philosophical or
scientific, or that the given objects do not exist (because all 'opinion' is
false).</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.3 Ontological
Properties of Physical-Behavioural Units</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Each physical-behavioural unit has two sorts of
components: human beings behaving in certain ways (lecturing, sitting,
listening, eating), and non-psychological objects with which behaviour is
transacted (chairs, walls, paper, forks, scalpels, etc.). Each
physical-behavioural unit has a boundary which separates an organized internal
(foreground) pattern from an external (background) pattern (Husserl's
'horizon'). This boundary, too, though it is far from simple, is an objective
part of nature, though it may change according to the participants involved or
according to the circumstances from moment to moment. Each unit is circumjacent
to its components, which means that the former surrounds (encloses, encompasses)
the latter without a break: the pupils and equipment are <i>in </i>the class;
the shop opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m. The surrounding portion of
reality is, to be sure, not distinguished physically from its neighbours. The <i>significance</i>
of this demarcated portion of reality is exclusively psychological in nature
(pertains, indeed, to the psychology of common sense); but it <i>exists </i>as
part of physical reality nonetheless.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Units have their own
behaviour, and their own laws which govern this behaviour - laws which are
different from those that govern the behaviour of the persons involved (this,
too, is a consequence of transcategoriality, and has done much to make
physical-behavioural units resistant to scientific treatment). For Barker, the
laws governing such units may best be understood in mechanical or at least
artefactual terms (terms which will recall our discussion of Anton Marty's
theory of collective objects in the foregoing):</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The
model of an engine seems to be more appropriate to represent what occurs [in
the realm of physical-behavioural units] than is the model of an organism or
person. For example, this entity can be 'turned off' and disassembled at the
will of the operator, the chairman. He can adjourn the meeting (for a coffee break)
and call it to order again. While it is disassembled, some of the parts can be
adjusted (a discussant replaced). Individuals have no psychological properties
like these. (Barker 1978, pp. 34f)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The
temporal histories of at least many of the physical-behavioural units by which
our lives are structured thus have shapes distinct from the temporal histories
of individual persons and their individual experiences. Physical-behavioural
units often have sharp beginnings and endings (consider the beginning and ending
of a race, or of a contractual agreement). Our pains, illnesses, regrets, in
contrast, characteristically grow and fade in intensity. Physical-behavioural
units and their settings are also sometimes marked by spatial borders which are
more crisp and more often rectilinear than are the spatial borders of naturally
occurring phenomena such as epidemics or storms. The borders of behaviour
settings need not be crisp in other respects, however. (Consider, for example,
the question whether the groom's sneezing is or is not a part of that
physical-behavioural unit which is his wedding.)</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand,
physical-behavioural units manifest a capacity for self-sustenance which is
much more like what we find in the biological realm. They are characteristically
self-regulating, and are such as to guide their components to characteristic
states and to maintain those states within limited ranges of values in the face
of disturbances.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup> Slight modifications
within given dimensions of the unit can be sustained without detriment to its
continued existence as a unit of this type. The total behaviour making up the
unit - for example a Rotary Club meeting - cannot be greatly changed, however,
without its being destroyed. The meeting must contain an introduction; there
must be a speech, there must be listening and discussion. Within the meeting,
there are the subparts: chairman, speaker, discussant, audience (as within the
sentence there are the subparts: subject, verb, noun, rising inflection, and so
on).</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.4 The Systematic
Mutual Fittingness of Behaviour and Ecological Setting</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A physical-behavioural unit is a unit: its<i> </i>parts
are<i> unified together</i>, but not through any similarity or community of
substance.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The behaviour and the physical
objects that together constitute the totality of a given physical-behavioural
unit are intertwined in such a way as to form a pattern that is by no means
random: there is a relation of harmonious fit between the standard patterns of
behaviour occurring within the unit and the pattern of its physical components.
(The seats in the lecture hall face the speaker. The speaker addresses his
remarks out towards the audience. The boundary of the football field is,
leaving aside certain predetermined exceptions, the boundary of the game. The
beginning and end of the school music period mark the limits of the pattern of
music behaviour.) This mutual fittingness of behaviour and physical environment
extends to the fine, interior structure of behaviour in a way which will imply
a radical nontransposability of standing patterns of behaviour from one
environment to another. The physical or historical or ceremonial conditions
obtaining in particular settings are in addition as essential for some kinds of
behaviour as are persons with the requisite authority, motives and skills.<sup><a
href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup></span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are various forces
which help to bring about and to sustain this mutual fittingness and thus to
constitute the unity of the physical-behavioural unit through time.<sup><a
href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup> Forces which flow in the direction from setting to
behaviour include physical constraints exercised by hedges, walls or corridors
or by persons with sticks; they include social forces manifested in the
authority of the teacher, in threats, promises, warnings; they include the
physiological effects of climate, the need for food and water; and they include
the effects of perceived physiognomic features of the environment (open spaces
seduce children, a businesslike atmosphere encourages businesslike behaviour).
Mutual fittingness can be reinforced by learning, and also by a process of
selection of the persons involved, whether this be one of self-selection (of
children who remain in Sunday school class in light of their ability to conform
to the corresponding standing patterns of behaviour), or of externally imposed
mental or physical entrance tests. Influences which flow in the contrary
direction, which is to say from behaviour to setting, include all those ways in
which a succession of separate and uncoordinated actions can have unintended
consequences in the form of new types of actions and new, modified types of
settings in the future (as the passage of many feet causes pathways to form in
the hillside).<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup> In the case, finally, of
physical-behavioural units which involve a multiplicity of persons as
participants there are influences which flow from the exercise of the
controlling power which different members exercise to different degrees over
the unit's functioning.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.5 Hierarchical
Nesting</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Many physical-behavioural units occur in
assemblies, as a chick embryo, for example, is constructed as a nested
hierarchy of organs, cells, nuclei, molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles.
Both the stable patterns of behaviour on the part of the persons involved
within the unit and the stable patterns of associated physical objects are
standardly capable of being further divided into sub-units with more or less
definite, salient boundaries of their own:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A
unit in the middle range of a nesting structure is simultaneously both
circumjacent and interjacent, both whole and part, both entity and environment.
An organ - the liver, for example - is whole in relation to its own component
pattern of cells, and is a part in relation to the circumjacent organism that
it, with other organs, composes; it forms the environment of its cells, and is,
itself, environed by the organism. (Barker 1968, p. 154)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>There
may be many physical-behavioural units of a lower-level kind within a given
locality, and these are typically embedded within larger units. The drawing of
the triangle on the blackboard is embedded within the geometry lesson, which is
embedded within the school, which is embedded within the neighbourhood, and so
on.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup></span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Gibson, reality in
general is a complex hierarchy of inter-nested levels: molecules are nested
within cells, cells are nested within leaves, leaves are nested within trees,
trees are nested within forests, and so on.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
Each type of organism is <i>tuned</i> in its perception and actions to objects
on a specific level within this complex hierarchy, to objects which together
form what Gibson calls an 'ecological niche'. (Gibson's own account of this
relationship of tuning - in terms of information pick-up - need not detain us
here.) A niche is that into which an animal <i>fits</i>; it is that in relation
to which the animal is habituated in its behaviour.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup>
A niche embraces not only things of different sorts, but also shapes, textures,
tendencies, boundaries (surfaces, edges), all of which are organized in such a
way as to enjoy affordance-character for the animal in question: they are
relevant to its survival. The given features motivate the organism; they are
such as to intrude upon its life, to stimulate the organism in a range of
different ways.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perceptions and actions
of human beings are likewise <i>tuned </i>to the characteristic shapes and
qualities and patterns of behaviour of our own respective (mesoscopic)
environments.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup> This mutual embranglement is
however in our case extended further via artefacts, and via cultural phenomena
such as language and its associated institutions, including institutions of
law, administration and politics. To learn a language is in part also to extend
the range of objects in relation to which we are able spontaneously to adjust
our behaviour and thus to extend radically the types of niche or setting into
which we can spontaneously fit.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the nesting of
physical-behavioural units we can distinguish also a range of cases where
behaviour settings influence each other even in the absence of any circumjacent
higher-level setting within which they would be jointly housed. Thus
neighbouring countries (especially countries at war, or countries subject to
border-disputes), and competing businesses or street gangs, influence each
other mutually. In some cases this mutual influence can give rise to, and can
be monitored (and influenced and to a degree steered from afar) by, new sorts
of physical-behavioural units such as (sittings of) boundary commissions, trade
associations, multinational treaty organizations, and the like. Reciprocal
co-determination of physical-behavioural units is illustrated also in cases
where different laboratories across the globe effect a cross-checking of each
other's results.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup> Through administrative
delegation, through sub-contracting, and through the institutions of
representative government the scope of effective operation of
physical-behavioural units can in principle become extended without limit,
which is to say: extended even far beyond the compass of what can be achieved
through the actions and perceptions of individuals in direct interaction. As
the experience of central planning in communist Europe demonstrates, however,
there are limits to such extension.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup></span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.6
Transcategoriality and Generic Dependence of Physical-Behavioural Units</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>A physical-behavioural unit such as a religious
meeting, a tennis championship or a sea battle is an intricate complex of
times, places, actions, and things. Its constituents can include both man-made
elements (buildings, streets, cricket fields, books, pianos, libraries, the
bridges and engine-rooms of battleships) and also natural features (hills,
lakes, waves, particular climatic features, patterns of light and sound). These
features and elements may be further restricted to a highly specific
combination of, say, a particular room in a particular building at a particular
time with particular persons and particular objects distributed in a particular
pattern. In general, however, it is a form of generic dependence which prevails
in the realm of physical-behavioural units; a judge must hear and decide the
case, but it need not be this judge; the capital city must be located
somewhere, but it need not be located in this spot (and in time of war it may
be relocated).</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical-behavioural unit
comprehends things and behaviour, but it may, through these, comprehend also a
variety of additional, non-physical components. Thus the unit may comprehend
for example different types of linguistic, legal and institutional elements,
all combined together in space and time in highly specific ways. The phenomena
involved are in addition diverse not only as concerns their material
constitution but also as concerns their ontological form: thus they comprehend
continuants, events, actions, states and manifold relations between all of
these. As Barker puts it, echoing earlier remarks by Ehrenfels:<sup><a
href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup></span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The
conceptual incommensurability of phenomena which is such an obstacle to the
unification of the sciences does not appear to trouble nature's units. - Within
the larger units, things and events from conceptually more and more alien
sciences are incorporated and regulated. (Barker 1968, p. 155)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>As
far as our behaviour is concerned, therefore, even the most radical diversity
of kinds and categories need not prevent integration.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.7 Persons as
Social Objects</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The relation between participant and setting is
to different degrees one of reciprocal co-determination. Each participant has
two positions within the unit: first, he is a component, and thus contributes
to forming the unit; second, he is an individual whose behaviour, and whose
very nature as participant social object, is itself partly formed by the unit
of which he is at any given moment a part, though not in such a way as to
affect his continued existence as a human being. Schoggen describes
physical-behavioural settings as consisting of 'highly structured, improbable
arrangements of objects and events that coerce behavior in accordance with
their own dynamic patterning.' (1989, p. 4) The person is coloured and shaped,
is determined through and through, by the behavioural context of the moment.
And because this context is subject to change, it follows, as Schoggen points
out, that</span> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:€€€'>a person has many strengths, many intelligences, many social
maturities, many speeds, many degrees of liberality and conservativeness, and
many moralities, depending in large part on the particular contexts of the
person's behavior. For example, the same person who displays marked
obtusiveness when confronted with a mechanical problem may show impressive
skill and adroitness in dealing with social situations. (Schoggen 1989, p. 7.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>And
as the phenomenologist Aurel Kolnai puts it, a human society</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>is
not only composed of various parts - it is composed of various parts in a
multiplicity of ways; and consequently its component parts cannot but <i>overlap</i>.
In other words, it consists ultimately of individuals, but only in the sense
that it divides into a multitude of individuals across several social
subdivisions, such that it comprehends the same individual over and over again
in line with his various social affiliations, - some of them factual, natural
and 'statistical', some of them largely or wholly a result of voluntary choice.
(Kolnai 1981, p. 319)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Thus
a society is composed of members of the community, of marriage and of the
family, of the social class, of the union, of the borough, of the state, of the
church, etc., and to each of these there corresponds in the life of each one of
us different zones of salience and motivation, different strands of
physical-behavioural units in which we are engaged.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As (undetached) parts of
non-collective continuants (your arm, my leg) have special features, so also
the participants in collective continuants (actors, admirals, astronomers,
artists) have certain analogous special features. Human beings serve not as <i>parts</i>
of social objects (in the unadorned mereological sense of part) but rather, and
in virtue of the different <i>roles</i> they occupy, as <i>members </i>or <i>elements.</i>
We can provide a tentative account of these features in terms of Brentano's
account in his <i>Theory of Categories</i> of what he called the 'modal
extensions' of common or garden substances. The latter, Brentano claimed, can
become transformed in various ways into new types of objects, for example
through their involvements in occurrents of different types. If John is running
then <i>John the runner</i> is a (short-lived) modified continuant of this
sort. If John is married then <i>John the husband </i>is likewise a (typically
more enduring) modified continuant of a different (institutional) sort. Objects
of this sort have been called by Kit Fine (in his 1982) 'qua objects' (in
reflection of earlier ontologists' talk of 'John qua runner', 'Bill qua
President', 'Socrates qua philosopher' and the like).</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From our present perspective <i>John
qua runner</i> is, during the time when he exists, the mereological sum of John
and the present phase of the occurrent running in which he is currently
engaged. John qua husband, more complicatedly, is the mereological sum of John
and some institutional occurrent; but the latter does not exist as separate
element, tied only to John. Rather it is essentially a part of a much wider
institutional whole which embraces, <i>inter alia, </i>legal, religious,
social, fiscal, and biological elements tied to a succession of
physical-behavioural units. Husband John, we may say, is the sum of John
together with some (his) portion of that total institutional bond which (for
the time period in question) ties him to his wife (and should John and Mary be
cast asunder, then John the husband and Mary the wife will both,
instantaneously, cease to exist).</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>3.7 From Ecological
Psychology to International Law</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Our theory of social objects can now be
formulated as follows. There are physical-behavioural units, standing patterns
of behaviour and physical environments, in which we are all involved in our
daily activities. Such physical-behavioural units are as much a part of the
furniture of reality as are garden-variety continuants and occurrents (such as
you and me). This is, if one will, a pre-analytic datum of the theory.
Physical-behavioural units have parts - including chairman John (at the lecture
meeting) and golfer Jim (at the links). And they have consequences - including
contracts signed, orders issued, judgments passed, medals awarded.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some physical-behavioural
units form extended chains, repeated instantiations of the same or of connected
behaviour patterns in historical progression, so that the corresponding parts
and consequences, too, enjoy a status which appears to transcend any particular
instantiation. President Bill is President even when he sleeps. The borders of
Luxemburg remain the borders of Luxemburg even though they are no longer
policed or fenced.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical-behavioural units
are part of reality: they have physical things and behaviour as parts. The
physical setting of a physical-behavioural unit (the stock exchange building)
can still exist even when no pertinent behaviour is occurring; but the unit
itself (the stock market on each successive trading day) requires pertinent
behaviour in order to exist. In the realm of animal behaviour, similarly, the
setting of a physical-behavioural unit (the ecological niche) can still exist
even when, because the geese have flown, no pertinent behaviour is occurring.
But the unit itself (the nesting grounds in the nesting season) requires pertinent
behaviour in order to exist.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see how this theory would
work, let us consider the case of <i>fiat objects</i> in the spatial realm,
objects which arise as a result of the fact that spatial boundaries come to be
drawn, for example dividing one parcel of land from another, through acts of
human decision or fiat.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup> National borders,
as well as county- and property-lines, provide examples of fiat boundaries in
this sense, at least in those cases where, as in the case of Colorado, Wyoming
or Utah, they lie skew to any qualitative discontinuities on the side of the
underlying reality. Dade County, Florida, the United States, the Northern
Hemisphere, etc., are fiat objects of the geographical sort.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such fiat spatial objects, now,
are determined through and through by the physical-behavioral units with which
they are associated. A real estate parcel is what and where it is (and is
distinct in its nature from any underlying plot of virgin land) because of
actions of specific sorts that occur in registry offices and as parts of
geodetic surveys. A nation is what and where it is because of actions of
specific sorts that occur in offices of state, in high chancelleries and in
military outposts. A work of art is what and where it is because of actions of
specific sorts that occur in offices of art historians, gallery directors and
curators, and in restoration studios. Each of these processes of authentication
can of course break down. Thus for example the activities of confidence tricksters
in the field of real-estate transactions may create fake physical-behavioral
units which are, to some lucky punters, indistinguishable from the genuine
article. Jackson (1990) shows how the state system of international law, based
on the principle of mutual recognition, may operate in such a way as to bestow
statehood even upon 'quasi-states' whose putative governments are entirely
lacking in internal control of the relevant territory. And rogue gallery
directories have in similar fashion in recent decades lent spurious credence to
whole genres of quasi-art. Once again, however, the very possibility of such
breakdown presupposes the correct working of the corresponding system of
physical-behavioural units in the normal case.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>4. Is Gibson a
Realist?</span></b> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The closeness of Gibson's ecological perspective
to the phenomenological theories of the life world (or of <i>'Umwelt'</i> or
'milieu' or 'bodily space') put forward not only by Husserl but also by his
fellow phenomenologists and by constructivist biologists such as von Uexküll
might lead us now to call into question the view thus far accepted according to
which Gibson is to be understood in realist terms. Katz (1987) asks us to
consider in this light the following characteristic statements from Gibson's <i>Ecological
Approach to Visual Perception</i>:</span> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>animal<i>
</i>and <i>environment </i>make an inseparable pair. Each term implies the
other. No animal could exist without an environment surrounding it. Equally,
although not so obvious, an environment implies an animal (or at least an
organism) to be surrounded. (1979, p. 8)</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>The <i>affordances</i>
of the environment are what it <i>offers</i> the animal, what it <i>provides</i>
or <i>furnishes, </i>whether for good or ill. - I mean by [affordance]
something that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no
existing term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the
environment. (1979, p. 127)</span> </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>[A]n affordance is
neither an objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you
like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective. - It is
both physical and psychical, yet neither (1979, p. 129).</span> <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>These
passages dictate, according to Katz, a relativist reading according to which,
as according to Uexküll, different species <i>live in different worlds</i>:</span>
<br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Do
terrestrial animals perceive water correctly and aquatic species incorrectly,
or vice versa? Gibson as relativist tells us no. Each lives in a different
world and, complementarily, each perceives differently. Water is a substance in
one world and a medium in another; it is not absolutely substance, nor is it
absolutely medium. 'The animal and its environment, remember, are reciprocal
terms.' One could never say what water is, without saying for whom it is, and
conversely. (Katz 1987, p. 120)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>There
are two principal motivations for relativist and representationalist views of
cognition: (1) the problem of <i>error</i>, and (2) the problem of seeming
global incompatibilities between different systems of representations.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perceptual error, according
to standard conceptions, reveals that perception cannot be solely a product of
inputs. It tells us that, on occasion at least, for example in cases of
hallucination, perceptual objects are created or constituted by the perceiver.
The relativist holds that the world that is given in perception is always in
this sense a constructed or constituted world. The relativist is thus able to
solve the problem of error without abandoning the goal of a unified theory of
perception, but only at the heavy price of cutting off the roots of his theory
in the one, real world that, from the common-sense perspective, serves as the
environment of perception. The realist solution to the problem of error denies
that what is phenomenologically experienced as the unitary phenomenon of 'perception'
is in fact a unitary phenomenon at all from the ontological point of view. The
task of providing a theory of perception (of successful, veridical,
world-embrangled perception) is then to be distinguished from another, quite
different task of giving an account of perceptual error (of the different types
of shortfall from the standard, veridical case).</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second motivation for
relativism might be formulated as follows: our common-sense perceptual space
has, it seems, a Euclidean structure (or a structure closely related thereto);
the space of the physicist have another, quite different structure; and it may
well be that the perceptual spaces of mice, of spiders, of clams, have other
structures again. Not all of these structures can be <i>true of</i> space as it
is in itself. Hence, the argument proceeds, our (and the mouse's and spider's)
perceptual spaces are mere 'representations'. It is a constructivist,
relativist, projectionist, Kantianist conclusion of this sort which Katz
attributes to Gibson.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, to remain with Katz's
own preferred example, space (as we may here assume) is a continuum. Like all
continua it can be partitioned in a range of mutually incompatible ways (as a
cheese can be sliced in such a way as to produce either triangular or
rectangular or disk-shaped segments but not all of these at once). All members
of a family of mutually conflicting 'perceptual spaces', now, may very well
turn out to be compatible after all, if they are interpreted as expressing
distinct <i>partitions</i>, for example partitions on different levels of
granularity, of one and the same reality. The world (like a lump of cheese) can
be sliced into pieces in more than one way. And one advantage of mereology as
an instrument of ontology is that it shows us how this is so.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every language, every theory,
every system of animal behaviour, generates from this perspective its own
global partition of reality. The various animal behaviour-systems generate
corresponding partitions of reality into <i>ecological niches</i>. And human
perception and action together generate that mesoscopic partition of reality we
call the common-sense world.</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A science of human
environments will look very different from any science of the more standard
sort. This has led some philosophers and cognitive scientists to suppose that
environments, settings, physical-behavioural units are 'phenomena' only - that
they are subjective constructs, properly to be treated within the framework of
a representationalist or 'methodologically solipsistic' psychology. The
challenge as Gibson saw, is to demonstrate how a science of environmental
settings can be '<i>consistent</i> with physics, mechanics, optics, acoustics,
and chemistry', being only a matter of 'facts of higher order that have never
been made explicit by these sciences and have gone unrecognized.' (Gibson 1979,
p. 17) To meet this challenge we need to develop a realist theory of the
physical-behavioural units and of other types of fiat objects relevant to
everyday human cognition in a manner which does not involve the rejection of
standard quantitative physics.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup> Gibson uses
the term 'ecology' precisely in order to designate the discipline that should
encompass these intermediate-level facts; it is presented as 'a blend of physics,
geology, biology, archeology, and anthropology, but with an attempt at
unification' on the basis of the question: what can stimulate the organism?
(Gibson 1966, p. 21)</span> <br>
<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How this is to be done is by
now, I hope, clear: physical behavioural units (and their animal counterparts),
and the social objects which go hand in hand therewith, are parts of the
spatio-temporal continuum of reality, the same reality that is described by
physics. They are, from the perspective of physical science, eldritch parts of
this reality indeed, parts which will never be capable of being understood as
the products of any combination of physical building-blocks. But they are parts
nonetheless.</span> <br>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>If one represents the environment of an animal at a
given moment as a circle, then one can add each successive moment as a new
environment-circle. In this way one would obtain a pipe which would correspond
in its length to the life of the animal. This pipe will be formed on all sides
with characters which one can think of as being built up along and around the
life's journey of the animal. This life's journey is thus similar to an
environment-tunnel that is closed at both ends. The type of character which can
appear in this environment-tunnel is fixed from the start, so that one can
designate its breadth and its richness as predestined. But also the temporal
length of the tunnel has a predetermined extent, which cannot be exceeded.
(Uexküll 1928, p .70) </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_7_"></a>7. Harrington 1996, p. 46. 'The
world of the physicist counts for the biologist only as a conceptual world [<i>nur
als eine gedachte Welt</i>], which corresponds to no reality but which is to be
assessed as an aid valuable for computation.' (Uexküll 1928, p. 61) </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_8_"></a>8. This theory of direct
perception has been the target of criticisms from Fodor and Pylyshyn (1981)
which have done much to ensure that Gibson's work remains unappreciated among
philosophers. These criticisms pertain to the question whether Gibson's
ecological approach can lead to the discovery of genuine lawful relations in
the psychological sphere. They do not address aspects of Gibson's work which
are of relevance to what is argued here. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_9_"></a>9. See for example Fine 1995,
Johansson 1989, Simons 1987, Smith 1996, Varzi 1994. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_10_"></a>10. The most valuable survey of
the ontology of continuants and occurrents is to be found in Ingarden 1964/65.
The terminology is derived from Johnson 1921/24. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_11_"></a>11. These are explored in
Zemach 1970. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_12_"></a>12. As Nenon (1997, p. 102)
emphasizes, Husserl himself would not run these different types of examples
together. For him relations like that between husband and wife or between a
king and his subjects are mere 'correlative relationships' governed by analytic
laws. Zelaniec (1996) shows, however, that it is a far from trivial matter to
draw a line between 'analytic' and 'synthetic' examples in this sphere. From
our present perspective all of the given examples form a single continuum. (See
also Zelaniec 1992.) </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_13_"></a>13. Examples of this sort,
treated of in Simons 1987, will here be left aside; their integrity can be
assumed to rest on simple physical factors such as gluing and nailing, and such
problems as they raise (pertaining above all to the question of the principle
of their identity through time) are not here at issue. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_14_"></a>14. See Gilbert 1989, 1993
(especially pp. 122f. of the latter, on 'plural subjects'). </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_15_"></a>15. For a discussion of Marty's
views on collectives and other varieties of non-real objects, see Smith 1994,
pp. 96ff. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_16_"></a>16. A view along these lines is
advanced in Searle 1995 (where the upper level of 'institutional facts' is seen
as being constructed and sustained by beliefs, habits and customs on the part
of those involved). Nenon (1997, p. 102) seems to impute a similar two-level
view to Husserl, but he here draws inappropriate implications from Husserl's
usage of the term 'abstract' as synonymous with 'dependent' in the third
Logical Investigation, a usage which has nothing to do with standard
interpretations of abstracta as entities belonging to special, higher-level
realms divorced from the realm of concrete, changing, corporeal substances. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_17_"></a>17. Reinach (1913) presents an
'ontology of social relations' on this basis which makes room in ingenious
fashion not only for social-institutional fiats but also for features of social
reality which are prior to all enactments and to all the positings of the
positive law. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_18_"></a>18. See Fritz Heider,
&quot;Thing and Medium&quot; in Heider 1959, 1-35. See also Schoggen 1989. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_22_"></a>22. The global system of
pathways across the hillside arises as an <i>unintended consequence</i> of many
actions carried out on a local scale. Friedrich von Hayek (1979) demonstrates
the degree to which a range of cultural phenomena, including law, language,
religion and the market, likewise owe their origin to an unplanned cumulation
of the effects of individual decisions and actions over time. The 'Austrian
school of economics, of which Hayek, along with Carl Menger and Ludwig von Mises,
is a leading member, seeks quite generally to understand large-scale social
phenomena in terms of their small-scale constituent parts - or in other words
in terms of the behaviour settings in which individual participants are
involved. On the manifold interconnections between the ideas of the Austrian
philosophers and those of the Austrian economists, see Grassl and Smith (eds.)
1986. The ideas here expounded, on behaviour settings, and on the 'tuning' of
organism to environment, are related also to the economists' notion of a
'market niche': see Smith 1986. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_23_"></a>23.&nbsp; Barker 1968, pp.
11f., 16; 1978, p. 34. </p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_26_"></a>26. Scheler, too, saw the need
to come to terms with the fact that we are in a certain sense tuned to our
environment, so that we can pick up information from our surroundings even in
the absence of conscious, reflective calculation: <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.0in'>There belongs to the momentary
&quot;milieu&quot; not only the series of objects that I perceive … while I am
walking in the street or sitting in my room, but also everything with whose <i>existence
or non-existence, </i>with whose being so or other than so,<i> </i>I
practically &quot;<i>reckon</i>&quot;, e.g. the cars and people that I avoid
(when I am lost in thought or when my gaze is fix on someone far away). A
sailor, for example, is able to &quot;reckon&quot; with an oncoming storm from
changes in his milieu without being able to say which <i>specific </i>change
(e.g., in the formation of the clouds, in the temperature, etc.) serves as a
sign. (Scheler 1954, p. 159, Eng. trans. p. 140)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><a name="N_27_"></a>27. In Book II
of his <i>Ideas</i> Husserl utilizes ideas very much like these in order to
provide an account of the special environments of, for example, historians,
natural scientists, and mathematicians. (See Smith 1995a.) </p>

phenomenological inquiries should be neglected; rather, these too need to be
pursued in a way that is consistent with the natural sciences: see Petitot, <i>et
al. </i>(in press). <br>
