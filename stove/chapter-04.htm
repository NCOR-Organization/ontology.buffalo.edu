<P>
As a preliminary to identifying Hume's key premise, some explanations
are needed.  One of them concerns the way the word "inductive" is used
throughout this book.  It is the more necessary to say something of
this, because the word is one which Hume himself never used in print.
</P>

<P>
A paradigm of "inductive argument", as the phrase is used here, is for
example the argument from "All the flames observed in the past have been
hot", to "Any flames observed tomorrow will be hot too".  (This example
is based on one of Hume's).  Another paradigm is, the argument from the
same premise to "All flames whatever are hot"; another is, the argument
from the same premise to "Any flames on Mars at this moment are hot".
</P>

<P>
Inductive arguments can be of many other forms than these, and of much
more complex forms.  But these few simple examples will suffice to
indicate that "inductive argument" is used here in exactly the same
way as it has been generally used by philosophers since Bacon, and in
exactly the same way as (for the most part) philosophers still use it.
Induction is argument, as the traditional philosophical phrase has it,
"from the observed to the unobserved".  In an inductive argument, the
premises are simply reports of something which has been (or could have
been) observed; the conclusion is a contingent proposition about what has
not been (and perhaps could not be) observed.  In addition, of course,
what the conclusion of an inductive argument says about the unobserved
is <EM>like</EM> what the premises say about the observed.
</P>

<P>
It will be evident from the preceding paragraph, and especially from its
last sentence, that the established philosophical concept of inductive
argument is not a very well-defined one.  Nevertheless, and perhaps
surprisingly, philosophers have found the concept well-defined enough
for all their purposes.  A sufficient proof of this is the fact that in
all particular cases---that is, once the premises and conclusion of an
argument have been specified---philosophers never have any difficulty
in reaching agreement as to whether the argument is an inductive one
or not.
</P>

<P>
There is one aspect of the established sense of "inductive" which nowadays
needs to be emphasised, because a sense of the word which is opposite
in this respect has grown up in the last forty years.  That is that,
applied to arguments, it is a purely <EM>descriptive</EM> epithet.
To call an argument or a class of arguments "inductive", is not to
<EM>evaluate</EM> it at all.  In particular, it is no part of what is
meant by calling an argument "inductive", that its conclusion does not
follow from its premises.  Inductive arguments are simply a certain class
(though indeed, if empiricism is true, a peculiarly important class)
of arguments, distinguished from other classes by the fact that their
premises and conclusions are propositions which respectively satisfy
certain purely descriptive conditions.
</P>

<P>
Whether all or only some of the members of this class, or none of them,
are <EM>reasonable</EM> arguments; what degree of logical value, if any,
such arguments have: this <EM>evaluative</EM> question can, of course,
be asked about inductive arguments, as it can be asked about any others.
But no answer to it, or any part of an answer, is implied in simply
calling an argument "inductive".  Philosophers have, of course, differed
deeply in their answers to this evaluative question about induction.
But before they can either agree or disagree about the logical value of
a certain class of arguments, they need first to have a non-evaluative
<EM>name</EM> for arguments of that class; and "inductive arguments", or
"induction", is just such a name.
</P>

<P>
Now the scepticism of Hume concerning induction is one answer to the
evaluative question which has just been mentioned.  It is an answer to
the question, what reasonableness or logical value, if any, inductive
arguments possess; and it is an answer of the most negative kind.
The premise of an inductive argument, Hume says, is <EM>no</EM> reason to
believe the conclusion of it; a proposition about the observed is never
a reason, however slight, to believe a contingent proposition about the
unobserved.  Hume, as I have said, does not himself call any arguments
"inductive"; but the texts leave no room at all for doubt that, concerning
those arguments which <EM>we</EM> call so, he embraced the thesis just
mentioned.  And this is his famous scepticism about induction.
</P>

<P>
Hume's philosophy "of the understanding" includes, however, very many
other `scepticisms' beside this one.  Two of these require mention here,
because there is some danger of their being confused with his scepticism
about <EM>induction</EM>, though in fact they are quite independent of it.
It is the latter alone, of course, with which we are concerned.
</P>

<P>
First, Hume's scepticism about induction must not be confused
with what he calls "scepticism with regard to the senses" [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-1">1</A>].  This is a scepticism as to whether the
senses really give us any access at all to the external world, even to
those parts of it closest to us in space and time.  There is a certain
amount of this kind of scepticism, too, in Hume's own philosophy; but
it is quite different from his, or anyone's scepticism about induction.
The latter is a denial of the reasonableness, <EM>assuming</EM> that
the deliverances of the senses are to be believed, of believing on their
account any conclusion which goes <EM>beyond</EM> them.  It is, in short,
a scepticism about <EM>arguments from</EM> premises of a certain kind,
not about whether premises of that kind are ever available to us to
begin with.
</P>

<P>
Second, Hume's scepticism about induction must not be confused
with what he called "scepticism with regard to reason" [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-2">2</A>].  This is, indeed, a kind of scepticism
which <EM>is</EM> about arguments; and there is some of it, too, in
Hume's philosophy.  But the grounds Hume gives for his scepticism
about induction are entirely independent of those he gives for his
`scepticism with regard to reason'; and the latter conclusion is no
more about inductive arguments than it is about any other special class
of arguments.  Hume's `scepticism with regard to reason' is, in fact, a
denial of the reasonableness of <EM>any kind of argument whatever</EM>:
logical or illogical, valid or invalid, mathematical or theological,
empirical or ethical, philosophical or scientific [...] whatever!
</P>

<P>
Later philosophers have taken little notice of the part of Hume's
<EM>Treatise</EM> in which he defended this indiscriminating and (it
must be admitted) uninteresting kind of scepticism; and of the little
notice they have taken of it, most has been unfavorable.  Hume himself
was apparently willing enough, on more mature reflection, that his
`scepticism with regard to reason' should be forgotten.  For although
he is an exceptionally repetitive writer, and published the substance
of the <EM>Treatise</EM> Book I again in the <EM>Abstract</EM>, and yet
again in the first <EM>Enquiry</EM>, he never anywhere once mentioned
<EM>this</EM> kind of scepticism again.  By contrast, his argument for
scepticism about <EM>inductive</EM> arguments is nothing less than the
central thing in the <EM>Treatise</EM> Book I, the <EM>Abstract</EM>,
and the first <EM>Enquiry</EM>.  And how unwilling later philosophers,
at least 20th-century ones, have been to forget <EM>this</EM> part of
Hume's philosophy, we have already seen.
</P>

<P>
Hume's argued for scepticism about induction (as has just been indicated)
in three different books.  They are <EM>A Treatise of Human Nature</EM>
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-3">3</A>]; <EM>An Abstract [of A Treatise of
Human Nature]</EM> [<A HREF="notes.html#04-4">4</A>]; and <EM>An Enquiry
concerning Human Understanding</EM> [<A HREF="notes.html#04-5">5</A>].
In each of these books Hume gives, for his sceptical conclusion about
induction, only one argument.  The argument is, however, the same each
time.  The three different versions of it differ only in conciseness,
and in the degree to which the argument is mixed up with extraneous
matter.  But in these respects the three versions differ widely.
In the <EM>Treatise</EM>, the relevant parts are Book I Part III
Sections II-XIV.  These Sections, which occupy almost a hundred pages
(in the standard edition referred to in the bibliography), contain both
<EM>several</EM> versions of the argument for inductive scepticism, and
a great deal of other matter as well.  The most concise version of the
argument, and overall the best, is that given in the <EM>Abstract</EM>;
where it occupies pp. 11--16 (of the standard edition referred to in
the bibliography).  In the <EM>Enquiry</EM> the argument is to be found,
in a less concise form than that of the <EM>Abstract</EM>, but in a far
more concise one than that of the <EM>Treatise</EM>, in Sections IV and V.
</P>

<P>
The account of this argument which is given below has grown out
of an account which I gave in <EM>Probability and Hume's Inductive
Scepticism</EM> [<A HREF="notes.html#04-6">6</A>].  There is only one
respect of any importance in which these two accounts of the arguments
actually conflict.  To this I draw attention below, when I reach the
relevant part of Hume's argument.  But most of the many differences
in detail between the two accounts are simply by way of addition.
That is, much of the detail of Hume's argument, which was either left
entirely unnoticed or at best suggested by my earlier account, is made
explicit here.  At the same time, the present account of the argument is
intended to be, and I believe is, quite self-contained.  In other words,
while the reader, in order to judge whether the account given here of
Hume's argument is correct and complete, will need familiarity with
the parts of Hume's philosophy which were referred to in the preceding
paragraph, he will not need anything else.
</P>

<P>
Hume's argument for inductive scepticism is itself, however, not quite
self-contained.  His thesis, that the premise of an inductive argument
is no reason to believe the conclusion, is not quite the end of the
argument in which it occurs.  The argument for this thesis is only a
part, thought it is indeed by far the greater part, of Hume's argument
for a sceptical conclusion which is far more general still.  This is
the Humean thesis which in the preceding chapter I called "scepticism
about the unobserved".  It says, there is no reason <EM>whatever</EM> (as
distinct from merely, "no reason <EM>from experience</EM>") to believe
any contingent proposition about the unobserved.  It will be worthwhile
to extend our account of Hume's argument so as to take in this, its
very last, step; even though to do so involves some slight repetition
of something which was said in Section 3 of Chapter III above.
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><BIG>2</BIG></DIV>

<P>
The best place to begin is at the end of Hume's argument.
</P>

<P>
The conclusion of the whole is a general sceptical thesis about
whatever has not been observed: that there is no reason (from any
source) to believe any contingent proposition about the unobserved.
(Call this proposition <EM>A</EM>).  Here it is in some of Hume's
own words: "[...] we have no reason to draw any inference concerning
any object beyond those of which we have had experience [...]" [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-7">7</A>].
</P>

<P>
There is no difficulty (as has already been indicated) in determining
what Hume's immediate grounds are for this conclusion.  For there are two
propositions which he constantly asserts and clearly intends to be taken
together, and which, when they <EM>are</EM> taken together, immediately
and obviously entail <EM>A</EM>.
</P>

<P>
One of these grounds is empiricism: the thesis that the only reason to
believe a contingent proposition about the unobserved is a proposition
about what has been observed.  (Call this <EM>B</EM>).  In some of
Hume's own words: "[...] All the laws of nature, and all the operations
of bodies without exception, are known only by experience [...]" [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-8">8</A>].
</P>

<P>
The other immediate ground of <EM>A</EM> is Hume's inductive scepticism:
the thesis that <EM>even</EM> propositions about the observed are not
a reason to believe any contingent proposition about the unobserved.
(Call this <EM>C</EM>).  In some of Hume's own words:  "[...] we have
no argument to convince us, that objects, which have, in our experience,
been frequently conjoined, will likewise, in other instances, be conjoined
in the same manner [...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-9">9</A>].
</P>

<P>
The structure of this last step of Hume's argument is as easily identified
as the elements of it.  It was as represented in the following diagram.
</P>

<PRE>
    C }
    B } -&gt; A
</PRE>

<P>
Our object being only to identify Hume's argument, not to evaluate it, the
arrows in my `structure-diagrams' are to be understood in a descriptive
sense only, not in any evaluative one.  Thus "X -&gt; Y", for example,
would mean here, not that an argument from X to Y is valid, or that X
is a reason to believe Y, or anything of that sort.  It would mean that
Hume in fact <EM>gave</EM> X <EM>as</EM> a reason to believe Y, and it
would mean nothing else.
</P>

<P>
At the same time, it is quite obvious that Hume <EM>intended</EM> his
argument to be a valid one, and thought that it was.  I too believe that
the argument he intended is in fact valid.  Of course Hume sometimes
left unexpressed certain premises which are necessary to make his
arguments valid, as every arguer must do if he is not to be tedious.
But when he does, it is almost always easy, for a reader familiar with
his philosophy "of the understanding", to supply the additional premise
which Hume intended, and which is needed to make his argument valid.
There is in fact only a single step in the entire argument of which
this is not true.  I intend to proceed, therefore, by assuming at each
step that the argument is valid, and attributing to Hume the additional
premise necessary and sufficient premise to make it so.  Hence an arrow
in my structure-diagrams, although it will not <EM>signify</EM> a valid
step, will always represent a step which was (I believe) made by Hume,
and which is (I believe) valid as well.
</P>

<P>
It will be obvious that Hume's scepticism about the unobserved
(<EM>A</EM>) does follow from the conjunction of empiricism (<EM>B</EM>)
with inductive scepticism (<EM>C</EM>).  It will be equally obvious
that <EM>A</EM> does not follow from <EM>B</EM> alone; even though many
philosophers have thought, to the contrary, that Hume's scepticism about
the unobserved is an inevitable consequence simply of his empiricism.
It is not so obvious, but it is true and of some importance, that
<EM>A</EM> does not follow from inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> alone,
either.
</P>

<P>
If you want to reach a certain place, it is no fatal news to be informed
that the route <EM>via</EM> X will not get you there.  This will be
fatal news if and only if it is conjoined with the information that
no route other than the one <EM>via</EM> X will get you there either.
Just so, if you want to reach knowledge or reasonable belief about the
unobserved, it is no fatal news to be told that the inductive route (the
route <EM>via</EM> the observed), will not get you there.  Yet that is
all that inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> says.  This will be fatal news
if and only if it is conjoined with the information that no route other
than the inductive one will get you there.  Just that, however, is what
empiricism <EM>B</EM> asserts.  Hence scepticism about induction will not
commit you to scepticism about the unobserved, unless you also subscribe
to empiricism.  Someone who held that there are non-inductive routes to
knowledge or reasonable belief about the unobserved---routes <EM>via</EM>
pure reason, say, or revelation---could with perfect consistency admit
<EM>C</EM> and yet deny <EM>A</EM>: that is, be a sceptic about induction
without being at all sceptical about the unobserved.
</P>

<P>
Neither <EM>B</EM> nor <EM>C</EM> was a <EM>premise</EM> of Hume's
argument.  Inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> is, of course, so irrationalist
a thesis that it could hardly be a <EM>starting-point</EM> of any
argument advanced by a sane person (at any rate before about 1950);
certainly <EM>Hume</EM> had to argue for it.  But neither was empiricism
<EM>B</EM> a starting-point of Hume's argument.  For it, too, he argues.
Hume's argument for <EM>B</EM> was sometimes perfunctory, it is true,
as well as being usually short and elliptical.  The historical reason
for this is obvious: empiricism was a <EM>commonplace</EM> with Hume and
with his readers.  Hence <EM>B</EM>, quite unlike inductive scepticism
<EM>C</EM>, was something which require little defense.  Still, Hume
does have an argument for empiricism.  What was it?
</P>

<P>
Hume's main ground for empiricism, in the sense that it is the ground
which he usually gives as though it were a sufficient one, is this: that
propositions which are <EM>necessarily true</EM> are not a reason to
believe any contingent propositions.  (Call this <EM>D</EM>).  Unlike
necessary truths, "matters of fact are not ascertained", Hume says, "by
the mere operation of thought" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-10">10</A>], by
"demonstrative arguments" or "abstract reasoning <EM>a priori</EM>".
(When Hume speaks of "demonstrative arguments", he does not mean, as we
might mean, just <EM>valid</EM> arguments; he means, valid arguments from
<EM>necessarily true</EM> premises [<A HREF="notes.html#04-11">11</A>]).
</P>

<P>
It may appear from this that Hume begged the question in favor of
empiricism.  For the ground <EM>D</EM> just mentioned may seem scarcely
indistinguishable from the empiricism <EM>B</EM> for which it is supposed
to be a ground.  Well, it would not have been surprising, nor would it
have mattered much at the time, if Hume's argument <EM>had</EM> been
question-begging here, the reason being historical circumstance mentioned
a moment ago: that with Hume's contemporary readers empiricism was
virtually a <EM>datum</EM> anyway.  And since, as it happens, empiricism
is virtually a <EM>datum</EM> with most of Hume's readers now, too, it
would not matter much now, either, if his argument here had been circular.
In fact, however, it is not.
</P>

<P>
Empiricism <EM>B</EM> says that if there is any reason to believe a
contingent proposition about the unobserved, it is a proposition about
the observed.  Hume gives, as though it were sufficient to establish
this, the ground <EM>D</EM>, that necessary truths are no reason to
believe a contingent proposition about the unobserved (or any other
contingent proposition).  Now this is just like some one saying that the
murder, if it was murder, was committed by the gardener, and giving, as
though it were sufficient reason to establish this, the ground that at
any rate the butler did not do it.  Such a person is clearly assuming
that the murderer, if there is one, is either the gardener or the butler.
Equally clearly, Hume is assuming that if anything is a reason to believe
a contingent proposition about the unobserved, it is either a necessary
truth or a proposition about the observed.
</P>

<P>
This assumption, or rather the even stronger one, that any reason
to believe <EM>any</EM> proposition is either a necessary truth or a
proposition about the observed, is one which, once it is stated, will be
acknowledged by every student of Hume to have been absolutely central
to his thought.  No account of his philosophy of the understanding can
possibly be adequate if it does not make this assumption explicit and
prominent.  Without it, for example, it is quite impossible to explain
Hume's special affinity with the empiricists of the present century: an
affinity which (as was implied in Chapter III above), is no less obvious
than it is deep.  And the deficiencies of my own earlier-published
account of the present argument, I may observe, stem almost entirely
from my having failed to make explicit the part played in the argument
by this assumption.
</P>

<P>
The assumption has two parts, and it is helpful to separate them.
Consider the class, at first sight the oddly disjunctive class, of
propositions which are either necessary truths or propositions about
the observed.  What is common and peculiar to the members of this class?
Or rather, what did <EM>Hume</EM> think is common and peculiar to them,
and what gives them the special status that they enjoy in his philosophy?
These statements are not hard to answer.  Hume thinks of necessary truths
and propositions about the observed as being propositions, and the only
propositions, which can be known or reasonably believed, without having to
be inferred from <EM>other</EM> propositions known or reasonably believed:
as being propositions, and the only propositions, which are (as we may
say) <EM>directly accessible</EM> to knowledge or reasonable belief.
This is one half of the assumption.  (Call it <EM>E</EM>).
</P>

<P>
The other is the very natural assumption, about one proposition's being
a reason to believe another, which is almost inevitably expressed (and
is expressed by Hume) by means of a comparison with a chain or a ladder.
P's being a reason to believe Q is like a ladder which reaches, whether by
few rungs or many, from P to Q; and Hume's assumption is the exceedingly
plausible one that such a ladder, no matter how safe and climbable it may
be, will be no help at all to us for reaching Q, if we cannot reach P.
In order, then, for P to be a reason, however remote or indirect,
to believe Q, P must be <EM>directly</EM> accessible to knowledge
or reasonable belief.  Otherwise, as Hume says, "all our reasonings
would be merely hypothetical; and however the particular links might
be connected with one another, the whole chain of inferences would
have nothing to support it [...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-12">12</A>].
(The same condition is necessary, evidently, in order for P to be a
member of a conjunction, P-and-R, which is a reason to believe Q).
(Call this second part of the assumption <EM>F</EM>).
</P>

<P>
It is easy now to understand why Hume regularly proceeds as though
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>D</EM>: No necessary truth is a reason to believe any contingent
proposition,
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
is sufficient to establish
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>B</EM>: Any reason to believe a contingent proposition about the
unobserved is a proposition about the observed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It is because he was assuming both
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>F</EM>: If P is a reason or part of a reason to believe Q, then P
is directly accessible to knowledge or reasonable belief,
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
and
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>E</EM>: A proposition is directly accessible to knowledge or
reasonable belief if and only if it is either a necessary truth or a
proposition about the observed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The structure, then, of Hume's argument for empiricism, was:
</P>

<PRE>
    D }
    E } -&gt; B
    F }
</PRE>

<P>
I have implied that Hume's argument for empiricism <EM>B</EM> comes
into his argument for scepticism about the unobserved <EM>A</EM>,
only near the very end.  So it does, logically speaking, since what
it supplies is one of the immediate grounds of the ultimate conclusion.
In the actual order of Hume's presentation, however, the opposite is true.
He always completes the argument for empiricism <EM>B</EM> <EM>first</EM>,
before he even begins the argument for inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM>.
Moreover, when he does complete the latter, its conclusion is always
a deliberate <EM>echo</EM> of a premise of the earlier argument for
empiricism.  <EM>C</EM>, the thesis that even after experience we have
no reason to believe anything about the unobserved, echoes <EM>D</EM>,
the thesis that we have no such reason <EM>before</EM> experience, or
<EM>a priori</EM>.  And Hume had good literary and historical motives
for adopting this order of presentation of the parts of his argument,
and in particular for adopting this echo-device.
</P>

<P>
Everyone dislikes a sudden loud noise, but it is worse still if you are
half-asleep at the time.  Now <EM>D</EM>, the thesis that we have no
reason prior to experience to believe anything about the unobserved,
is a proposition which I have elsewhere called "Bacon's bell" [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-13">13</A>], in reference to Bacon's famous boast:
that he had "rung the bell that called the wits together", by insisting
that all contingent propositions be subjected to the test of experience
and to no other.  But of course by the time Hume wrote, this empiricist
maxim <EM>D</EM>, once so revolutionary, had become almost as much a
part of the British constitution as a church by law established, and
almost as soporific.  So Hume, by sounding Bacon's bell <EM>early</EM>
in his argument, as he always does, artfully creates in his readers a
sense of security.  Its familiar note assures them that this author is a
decent British empiricist, a Bacon-and-Newton man like the rest of us:
<EM>he</EM> will not disturb our Royal Society slumbers.  How much the
more appalling, then, when at the end of his argument he sounds what I
have called "Hume's bell", with its ghastly parody of this familiar note:
the thesis of inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM>, that we have no reason
for any beliefs about the unobserved, <EM>after</EM> experience either!
</P>

<P>
To the main part of Hume's argument, his argument for this staggering
conclusion, we now turn.  Here most of his premises are easily
identifiable, and it is best to go straight to them.
</P>

<P>
One premise is, that the conclusion of an inductive argument does
not follow from its premise, except in the presence of an additional
premise, or assumption, that the unobserved is <EM>like</EM> the
observed.  In some of Hume's own words: "All inferences from experience
suppose, as their foundation, that the future will resemble the past"
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-14">14</A>].  Again: "All probable arguments are
built on the supposition that there is [...] conformity between the future
and the past [...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-15">15</A>].  Yet again:
"[...] probability is founded on the presumption of a resemblance,
between those objects, of which we have had experience, and those, of
which we have had none [...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-16">16</A>].
</P>

<P>
Let us be sure we understand just what Hume is saying in these passages.
"Inferences from experience", "probable arguments", and "probability", are
simply some of the many names which Hume uses for what we call inductive
arguments: those arguments from the observed to the unobserved, of
which the argument from "All the many flames observed in the past have
been hot", to "Any flames observed tomorrow will be hot", may serve as
a paradigm.  And what Hume is pointing out is simply that this argument,
for example, is invalid as it stands, (the conclusion does not follow
from the premise), and that in order to turn it into a valid argument, you
would need to add to it a premise which asserts at least that tomorrow's
flames resemble the past observed ones.
</P>

<P>
Let us call a proposition which asserts that there is a resemblance
between the observed and the unobserved, a "Resemblance Thesis".
Then this first premise of Hume's argument for inductive scepticism is:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>G</EM>: Any inductive argument is invalid, and the weakest addition to
its premises sufficient to turn it into a valid argument is a Resemblance
Thesis.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Hume's next premise is also easily identified.  It is a proposition
about the nature of the Resemblance Thesis; namely
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>H</EM>: A Resemblance Thesis is a contingent proposition about
the unobserved.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In some of Hume's own words: "[...] that there is this conformity
between the future and the past, [...] is a <EM>matter of fact</EM>
[...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-17">17</A>].
</P>

Now Hume concludes, from this characterization of Resemblance Theses,
something about the nature of possible evidence for them; namely
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>I</EM>: A Resemblance Thesis is not deducible from necessary truths.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In some of his own words: a Resemblance Thesis "can never be proved
[...] by any demonstrative argument or abstract reasoning <EM>a
priori</EM>" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-18">18</A>].
</P>

<P>
It will be obvious that <EM>I</EM> does not follow from <EM>H</EM> alone,
but equally obvious what Hume's tacit premise was here.  It is the maxim,
which he is never tired of repeating, that "there can be no demonstrative
arguments for a matter of fact and existence".  That is, it was

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<EM>J</EM>: No contingent proposition is deducible from necessary truths.

This part of Hume's argument for <EM>C</EM> had, then, the structure:

<P>
Hume next considers the possibility of <EM>observational</EM> proof of a
Resemblance Thesis.  But the result, he finds, is as negative as in the
case of <EM>a priori</EM> proof.  That is, he concludes, in an obvious
parallel to <EM>J</EM>,
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>K</EM>: A Resemblance Thesis is not deducible from propositions
about the observed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
On what grounds?  Well, recall <EM>H</EM>: that a Resemblance Thesis
is a contingent proposition about the unobserved.  Any argument
to a Resemblance Thesis from <EM>the observed</EM> will thus be an
<EM>inductive</EM> argument, and, in view of <EM>G</EM>, therefore,
it will be invalid unless to the observational premises is added a
Resemblance Thesis.  That, however, is the very proposition which we are
trying to prove!  Any argument from experience for a Resemblance Thesis,
therefore, will be invalid unless it is circular.  Or in some of Hume's
words, "To endeavor [...] the proof of [a Resemblance Thesis] by probable
arguments, or arguments regarding existence, must evidently be going in a
circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very point in question"
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-19">19</A>].

<P>
Hume's grounds for <EM>K</EM>, then, are <EM>H</EM> and <EM>G</EM>.
For they together entail

<P>
and <EM>L</EM> in turn (remembering that we already have <EM>H</EM> as
a premise), is Hume's warrant for concluding that <EM>K</EM>.

<P>
Here, then, the structure of the argument was:
</P>

<PRE>
    H }
    G } -&gt; L -&gt; K

<P>
So far, then, Hume's argument for <EM>C</EM> has been as represented in

</P>

<PRE>
    H }
    J } ------&gt; I

    H } -&gt; L -&gt; K
    G }
</PRE>

<P>
The only premises have been <EM>G</EM>, <EM>H</EM>, and <EM>J</EM>.
</P>

<P>
But now, what is represented above is, as far as I can discover, the
whole of Hume's explicit argument for inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM>.
</P>

<P>
This assertion may be found surprising.  Proof of it would certainly
be desirable.  Unfortunately, however, it is impossible.  An old logical
saw says that one cannot prove a negative, and certainly one cannot prove
an exegetical negative such as this.  I am obliged, therefore, to rely
entirely here on what elsewhere Hume called "the method of challenge",
and to invite anyone who thinks there is something explicit in Hume's
argument for <EM>C</EM>, which is omitted in the above account of it,
to point it out: either another premise, or a result drawn by Hume from
premises already presented here.
</P>

<P>
If, as I believe, this cannot be done, then it must be admitted that
Hume's argument, while it is admirably explicit as far as it goes,
stopped a good deal short of the conclusion <EM>C</EM> which it was
intended to prove.  For <EM>C</EM> says that the premise of an inductive
argument is not a reason to believe its conclusion; yet so far we have
not got anything like that.  In the premises <EM>G</EM>, <EM>H</EM>,
and <EM>J</EM> (the only ones so far), there is nothing whatsoever, for
example, about what is required for one proposition to be a reason to
believe another.
</P>

<P>
Well, what <EM>have</EM> we got?  Or rather, since it is inductive
arguments and no others that are the subject of <EM>C</EM>, we should
ask how much, at the best, has so far been established about inductive
arguments?  The answer is plain.  At the best (that is, assuming Hume's
premises true as well as his steps valid), the most that follows from
Hume's premises, about inductive arguments, is the conjunction of
<EM>G</EM>, <EM>I</EM>, and <EM>K</EM>.  All that this conjunction says
is this: that any inductive argument is invalid, and that the weakest
additional premise sufficient to turn it into a valid argument is a
proposition which is not deducible either from necessary truths or from
propositions about the observed.
</P>

<P>
We need to make this result less unwieldy.  First, let us call any
additional premise which is sufficient to turn a given invalid argument
into a valid one, "a validator" of it; and let us call the weakest of
all the validators of a given argument, <EM>the</EM> validator of it.
Second, let us make use of the fact that, necessarily, a proposition is
<EM>deducible from</EM> a necessary truth or a proposition about the
observed, if and only if it is <EM>itself</EM> a necessary truth or a
proposition about the observed.  Because of this, instead of saying that
the validator of an inductive argument is not deducible from necessary
truths or observation-statements, we can say, without losing logical
equivalence, that that validator is itself neither a necessary truth nor
an observation-statement.  With the aid of these two abbreviations, what
the conjunction of <EM>G</EM>, <EM>I</EM>, and <EM>K</EM> says about
inductive arguments can be expressed as
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>M</EM>: Any inductive argument is invalid, and the validator of it
is neither a necessary truth nor a proposition about the observed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Obviously, <EM>M</EM> does not entail inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM>.
Indeed, since it is only an abbreviated logical equivalent of what
<EM>G</EM>, <EM>I</EM>, and <EM>K</EM> say about inductive arguments,
<EM>M</EM> cannot bring us any closer to <EM>C</EM> than the conjunction
of <EM>G</EM>, <EM>I</EM>, and <EM>K</EM> did; which is, as I said,
not very close.  Many philosophers nowadays would go much further than
this, and say that while <EM>C</EM>, though false, is at least important,
<EM>M</EM>, though true, is unimportant, because its truth is obvious.
</P>

<P>
I wish that some of these philosophers would tell us an important
and true result that <EM>does</EM> follow from the premises of Hume's
argument: this famous argument which all of us (and not only those who
accept its sceptical conclusion <EM>C</EM>) admire so much.  In fact,
however, the result <EM>M</EM> is not only true and original, but is
of profound importance.  Indeed it is Hume's central insight concerning
induction, and is what separates his philosophy of induction, and the best
of ours, from the slipshod philosophy of Bacon before and of Mill after
him, and of most empiricists even now.  Not only is <EM>M</EM> important
in itself.  In conjunction with some of the premises of Hume's empiricism
(and ours), it entails, as will be shown later, a further result which
is still more important, and one which most empiricists even now are
far from having fully absorbed.
</P>

<P>
These are large claims to be made for the not-very-pregnant-looking result
<EM>M</EM>; but I think I can establish them.  To do so, however, it is
necessary to take a step back from Hume's argument for a while.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
All philosophers and logicians are interested in evaluating arguments.
The evaluation of arguments is a complex matter, requiring many different
distinctions to be made.  For example, in some arguments the premises
<EM>cannot</EM> be a reason to believe the conclusion, while it other
arguments they are, and hence can be.  Then, where the premises are
a reason to believe the conclusion, there is the distinction between
arguments in which the premises are an <EM>absolutely conclusive</EM>
reason to believe the conclusion, and those in which they are not; that
is, between valid and invalid arguments from P to Q, where P is a reason
to believe Q.  Then there is the distinction, entirely independent of
the two just mentioned, between arguments in which the premises are
all true, and those in which they are not.  And so on.  In short, two
arguments can differ in value along a number of different, and even
independent, dimensions.
</P>

<P>
The ordinary or `deductive' logician, however, is interested,
<EM>ex officio</EM> at least, in only one dimension of the value of
arguments: namely in the distinction between validity and invalidity.
Most philosophers, on the other hand, regard the distinction between valid
and invalid arguments as a silly thing to have as an <EM>exclusive</EM>
object of interest.  They are right.  For one distinction which the
evaluation of arguments requires to be made is, as I have said, that
between arguments of which the premises are or could be a reason to
believe the conclusion, and arguments in which they cannot; while that
distinction is largely, if not entirely, independent of the distinction
between the valid and the invalid.  At any rate, it is certainly not
enough to make P a reason to believe Q, that the argument from P to Q
is valid.
</P>

<P>
If it <EM>were</EM> enough then no one, however irrational, need ever lack
a reason, and even an absolutely conclusion reason, to believe any and
every proposition whatever.  For you can always turn an invalid argument
into a valid one, merely by making a suitable addition to the premises.
Let your argument from P to Q be invalid; let it even be as atrocious
as a piece of reasoning can be; still, you can always turn it into a
valid argument, by the trifling expedient of adding the premise that P
is false or Q is true, or some other premise which entails that one.
Nothing could be easier.  And if the conclusions following from the
premises were enough to make those premises a reason to believe it,
then nothing could be more important than this stratagem, since it would
enable us all to ensure that whatever we believe, we believe reasonably.
</P>

<P>
In fact, of course, as is obvious, nothing could be more trivial.
That the premises of an argument entail the conclusion is <EM>not</EM>
enough to make them a reason to believe it.  And if the premises of an
argument are to succeed in being a reason to believe the conclusion,
not every validator R of the argument from P to Q is available to every
arguer as an additional premise.  Such an R, to be available to an arguer
as an additional premise, must at least be such that it <EM>can</EM> be
part of a reason to believe Q.
</P>

<P>
Very often, of course, such a validator <EM>is</EM> available to an
arguer.  My companion may disagree with my identification of a bird
which we are both looking at, and argue "The bird on that post is no
raven, since all ravens are black"; omitting, just in order not to be
tedious, the premise, which we have both just learnt from experience,
that the bird on the post is not black.  This proposition, which is of
course a validator, in fact <EM>the</EM> validator, of his argument, is
available to him as an additional premise, presumably.  At any rate it
certainly satisfies a necessary condition of such availability; that of
being a proposition which <EM>can</EM> be part of a reason to believe
his conclusion.
</P>

<P>
But it is not so in every case, that is, for every invalid argument;
and there are some validators which are <EM>never</EM> in any case
available to arguers as an additional premise.  If I am to succeed in
giving a reason to believe a contingent proposition Q, but my argument
to Q from P is invalid, I cannot add a premise R which is, for example,
self-contradictory.  A self-contradictory additional premise is indeed
a validator of every invalid argument.  But such a validator is not
available to any arguer to Q, because a self-contradiction cannot be
part of a reason to believe a contingent proposition.  Again, if I aim to
give a reason to believe Q, but my argument to Q from P is invalid, I may
not add as a premise the very proposition Q which I am trying to give a
reason to believe.  The conclusion of any invalid argument is indeed a
validator of it, but Q is not available to me or any arguer to Q as an
additional premise, because Q cannot be part of a reason to believe Q.
</P>

<P>
Given an argument from P to Q which is invalid, then, a validator of it,
R, may be available as an additional premise to an arguer whose object is
to give a reason to believe Q.  For R may be, in addition to whatever else
is required for availability, a proposition that can be part of a reason
to believe Q.  In such a case, for example the argument about the bird
on the post, the invalidity of the original argument is an unimportant
defect of it, because a cure for the defect is available to the arguer.
But not every validator R of a given invalid argument is available as
an additional premise to every arguer whose object is to give a reason
to believe Q.  For a validator R may be a proposition which cannot be
part of a reason to believe Q; or it may be a proposition which is
unavailable on some other ground.
</P>

<P>
Hence for philosophers, who must distinguish, as deductive-logicians need
not, between arguments in which the premises are or at least could be a
reason to believe the conclusion, and arguments in which they cannot, an
important general question arises.  In <EM>just what</EM> cases is a cure
for the invalidity of our arguments available to us, consistently with our
premises remaining a reason to believe our conclusion?  What propositions
are, and what are not, available validators of our invalid arguments?
</P>

<P>
This question, in its general form, is not one which Hume ever
explicitly considered.  Still, we know well enough what his answer
to it was, even in its general form.  His answer to it is given
by his premises <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM> above.  But Hume did of
course consider, and most explicitly, the special case of this general
question in which the arguments from P to Q are <EM>inductive</EM> ones.
That is, he did consider the question whether, when we argue from the
observed P to the unobserved Q, any validator R is available to us.
Indeed Hume never considered any question, concerning the evaluation of
induction, <EM>except</EM> this one.  His answer to it is, of course, that
<EM>no</EM> validator is available for inductive arguments.  His argument
for part of this answer is that which I have set out above.
</P>

<P>
What Hume did was to consider two classes of candidates for the position
of available validators of induction.  The first class consists of
necessary truths.  These were obvious candidates for consideration.
Propositions which cannot be false are, presumably, <EM>always</EM>
available as additional premises, to any arguer.  At any rate they
certainly satisfy the necessary condition of availability, that they
<EM>can</EM> be part of a reason to believe the conclusion of the
arguments now under discussion.  When the argument from P to Q is
inductive, a necessary truth R can be part of a reason, P-and-R, to
believe Q.
</P>

<P>
Alas, where the argument from P and Q is inductive, a necessarily-true
additional premise R, although available, will never satisfy the other
requirement of the position we are seeking to fill; it will not be
a validator.  The conclusion of any inductive argument is a contingent
proposition.  Where R is a necessary truth, the conjunction P-and-R is
logically equivalent just to P itself.  And two arguments with the same
contingent conclusion, and logically equivalent premises, cannot differ
in value along any dimension (except perhaps an economic or an aesthetic
one).  At any rate they cannot differ in that one of them is valid and
the other invalid.  So where R is a necessary truth, an argument from
P-and-R to contingent Q would be valid only if the argument to Q from P
alone were valid to begin with; which, in the case of inductive arguments
(as Hume's premise <EM>G</EM> says), it is not.  Trying to turn inductive
arguments into valid ones by adding necessarily true premises, is like
trying to increase a boat's displacement by taking on weightless ballast.
</P>

<P>
Hume then considers a second class of candidates for the position of
available validators of induction: propositions about the observed.
These, too, were natural candidates for consideration.  When we argue from
the observed P to the unobserved Q, <EM>another</EM> proposition R about
the observed is, presumably, very often available to us.  Certainly such
an R <EM>can</EM> be part of a reason, P-and-R, to believe a conclusion
Q about the unobserved.
</P>

<P>
But alas, these candidates too are unequal to the task of turning
inductive arguments into valid ones.  By adding a proposition R about
the observed, to the original premise P about the observed, the best you
can get, that is at the same time a proposition which can be a reason to
believe Q, is just another proposition about the observed; a stronger
one, indeed, than that with which you began, but still a proposition
about the observed.  But the conclusion Q is still a proposition about
the unobserved.  So, even with the premise P-and-R, our argument to Q is
an inductive one still.  And all inductive arguments (as Hume's premise
<EM>G</EM> says) are invalid.  As far as turning inductive arguments into
valid ones goes, therefore, propositions about the observed behave, as
additional premises, <EM>in exactly the same way as necessary truths</EM>.
At least <EM>this</EM> much is true, then, in the famous sceptical
passage in which Hume writes: "Now where is that reasoning, which,
from one instance, draws a conclusion, so different from that which it
infers from a hundred instances, that are nowise different from that
single one?  [...] I cannot find, I cannot imagine any such reasoning"
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-20">20</A>].
</P>

<P>
No proposition, then, which is either a necessary truth or a proposition
about the observed, is sufficient as an additional premise to turn an
inductive argument into a valid one.  <EM>A fortiriori</EM> no necessary
truth or proposition about the observed is the <EM>weakest</EM> of all the
validators (that is, is <EM>the</EM> validator) of any inductive argument.
That is, Hume's result <EM>M</EM> is true.
</P>

<P>
(It is, I hope, unnecessary to say that the argument just given for
<EM>M</EM> was simply a modernized version of the argument, set out above,
which Hume himself gave for it; and little enough modernized at that).
</P>

<P>
I need not contend here for originality of this result <EM>M</EM>.
It is, in fact, as original as anything in philosophy ever is.  What I do
need to contend for is its importance.  For, as I indicated earlier, many
philosophers nowadays suppose that the truth of <EM>M</EM> is obvious, and
even that it always was so, at least to philosophers.  Some go as far as
to suggest that <EM>M</EM> is an analytic truth of common English: that
what it says about inductive arguments is as trivial, and as well-known
to normal English-speakers, as what "A father is a male parent" says
about fathers.  These suppositions are not only false, but grotesque,
and the exact opposite of the truth.  The simplest way to prove this
is to show that we have ample testimony, from authorities too numerous,
recent, high, and even in a sense irresistible, to the <EM>falsity</EM>
of <EM>M</EM>.
</P>

<P>
In the first place <EM>everyone</EM>, in his bones, nerves, and muscles,
believes that <EM>M</EM> is false.  Strike a match and look at the flame.
Then try not to believe that you would feel heat if you held you hand
an inch over it.  You cannot do it.  You cannot even be <EM>less</EM>
confident, about this future thermal phenomenon, than you are about the
present visual phenomenon of the flame.  This is an example, of course,
of Hume's favorite kind of inductive inference, and the kind in relation
to which his entire argument for scepticism was in fact conducted:
what he calls "the inference from an impression to an (associated)
idea" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-21">21</A>], after we have had "a long
course of uniform experience" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-22">22</A>] of the
conjunction of the two properties, such as being a flame and being hot.
The corresponding inference <EM>before</EM> experience, or (as Hume
likes to say) in <EM>Adam's</EM> situation, is course the inference
just from "This is a flame" to "This will be hot".  Now no one, as
Hume is always saying, takes <EM>that</EM> premise as a reason to
believe that conclusion, and still less would anyone mistake it for an
<EM>absolutely conclusive</EM> reason to believe it.  But then, as Hume
is also always saying, once experience <EM>has</EM> supplied us with the
additional premise that all the many flames observed so far have been
hot, we <EM>do</EM> draw the conclusion that a flame as yet untested
will likewise be hot; and draw it, with a degree of confidence which is
introspectively indistinguishable from that with which we conclude, given
that all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, that Socrates is mortal.
In other words, we all do believe that, contrary to what <EM>M</EM> says,
the observation-statement about past flames <EM>is</EM> sufficient, as
an additional premise, to turn the argument from "This is a flame" to
"This will be hot" into a valid one.  At least, our bones, nerves and
muscles believe so.
</P>

<P>
These authorities against <EM>M</EM> will be admitted to be numerous and
recent, and even in a sense irresistible.  But they may be thought to be
rather low.  So let us turn to Bacon and Mill, who are sufficiently high
authorities on induction.  And let us ask what they would have thought
of the following inductive argument.  "The canary was alive and well
when we left the room an hour ago; but it is dead now.  Gas from the
oven was leaking into the room during that time.  So, if nothing else
caused the canary's death, the gas did".
</P>

<P>
That is, of course, a homely example of the very kind of inductive
argument with which Bacon and Mill were especially occupied: "eliminative
induction", as Mill aptly called it.  This argument is invalid, just
as Hume's premise <EM>G</EM> requires.  The validator of it is the
proposition that something caused the canary's death.  This proposition
is indeed, just as Hume's result <EM>M</EM> requires, neither a necessary
truth nor a proposition about the observed.  But the question is, was
this fact <EM>obvious</EM> to Bacon and Mill?  It would take a very bold
man, or a very ignorant one, to say so.
</P>

<P>
From what Bacon wrote about inductive arguments of essentially this kind,
it seems never to have crossed his mind what kind of proposition its
validator might be: for the simple reason that he seems to have thought
such an argument valid as it stands.  Mill at least knew better than that,
and accordingly he tried for a while, in Book III of his <EM>Logic</EM>,
to show that the validator of such an argument <EM>is</EM>, after all,
known from experience; or rather (with his characteristic rigor) that
anyway it nearly is; or that it is known from experience, at any rate
with "all the assurance we require for the guidance of our conduct"
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-23">23</A>] (`Conduct'?!)  But this apparent
modesty Mill was unable to sustain: his real confidence in what he
called the Law of Universal Causation was too deep.  To suppose that
the deterministic assumption (that the canary's death had a cause) was
<EM>not</EM> available to inductive reasoners, in 1843, evidently seemed
to Mill merely a solemn farce, and he could not keep it up.  So in the
end he simply throws up in impatience the question of the validity, or
the curable invalidity, of eliminative induction.  By doing so he seems,
to 20th-century philosophers, as he would have seemed to Hume, to have
left his philosophy of science in ruins.  In his own century, however,
there were very few who were of that opinion.
</P>

<P>
But leave even these mighty dead out of it.  Consider the argument
about the canary, and let us ask ourselves this.  What <EM>experimental
scientist</EM>, <EM>now</EM>, would have any more patience than Mill had,
with someone who tormented him with reminders that the additional premise,
which this argument needs to be valid, is not known to be true either
<EM>a priori</EM> or from experience?  Come to that, how many experimental
scientists would be conscious, any more than Bacon was, that the argument
is not valid as it stands?  These questions answer themselves.
</P>

<P>
So very wide of the truth, then, is the belief that <EM>M</EM> is a
truth which has always been obvious, at least to philosophers.  As for
the suggestion which some philosophers have made in recent decades, that
<EM>M</EM> is known to every competent English-speaker, like "A father is
a male parent" [...] I blush for my profession!  Quite the contrary to all
this, to bring to light the truth <EM>M</EM> about inductive arguments,
required the peculiarly fixed, strong, and passionless gaze by which
Hume was distinguished in mind as he was in body.  <EM>After</EM> Hume,
of course, you do not need to be a genius to know that <EM>M</EM> is
true; but that is a little different.
</P>

<P>
It is not only dead philosophers or living scientists, however, who have
not fully taken in the truth of <EM>M</EM>, or have not perceived the
full extent of its consequences for empiricist philosophy of science.
The same is true of most empiricist philosophers now.
</P>

<P>
The grounds which Hume <EM>explicitly</EM> gave for <EM>C</EM> amounted;
as we saw, only to <EM>M</EM>.  Yet <EM>C</EM> is his shocking conclusion
about induction; while <EM>M</EM> is so far from being shocking, at least
to philosophers now, that the difficulty with it is rather, as we have
seen, to secure recognition of its importance.  Hume proceeded, in other
words, as though his premises yield a result which is even stronger and
more important than <EM>M</EM>.
</P>

<P>
They do, too.  What this result is, will become clear if we ask ourselves
the following natural question.  Why did Hume consider, as candidates
for the position of available validators of induction, <EM>necessary
truths</EM>, <EM>observation-statements</EM>, <EM>and no others</EM>?
The answer is obvious.  To be available to inductive reasoners, a
validator of their arguments must at least be such that it can be part
of a reason to believe the conclusions of induction; and Hume thinks
that only necessary truths and observation-statements can be part of a
reason to believe anything.  In other words, Hume was here drawing again
on two of the premises of his earlier arguments for empiricism.  He was
taking <EM>M</EM> not on its own, but in conjunction with <EM>E</EM>
and <EM>F</EM>.  And when that it done, a result which is even more
important than <EM>M</EM> does follow.
</P>

<P>
It follows at once from <EM>M</EM>, <EM>E</EM>, and <EM>F</EM>, that
the validator R of an inductive argument from P to Q is not a reason
or part of a reason to believe the conclusion Q.  And necessarily, if
even the <EM>weakest</EM> validator R of an argument from P to Q is not
a reason or part of a reason to believe Q, then <EM>a fortiriori</EM>
any stronger validator of the argument cannot be a reason or part of
a reason to believe Q either.  For any stronger validator than R will
be logically equivalent to R-and-S for some S, and if R cannot be even
part of a reason to believe Q, then evidently no proposition logically
equivalent to R-and-S can be so either.  That is, <EM>no</EM> validator
of an inductive argument can be even part of a reason to believe the
conclusion of that argument.  Taken with <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>,
then, <EM>M</EM> entails:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>N</EM>: An inductive argument is invalid, and any validator of it
is not a reason or part of a reason to believe its conclusion.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is an enormously important result of Hume's argument.  I call it the
thesis of the incurable invalidity of induction.  Some invalid arguments,
we have seen (for example, the one about the bird on the post) are only
<EM>curably</EM> invalid; a validator of them is available to the arguer,
at least in the sense that such a validator can be part of a reason to
believe the conclusion of the argument.  What <EM>N</EM> says is that
inductive arguments are <EM>not</EM> like that; for <EM>their</EM>
invalidity, <EM>no</EM> cure is available.  Any additional premise,
if it <EM>is</EM> sufficient to make the conclusion of an inductive
argument logically follow, is <EM>not</EM> a reason or part of a reason to
believe the conclusion.  In other words, the fallibility or invalidity of
inductive arguments (the possibility of their having a false conclusion
even though their premises be true) is a feature absolutely inseparable
from them.
</P>

<P>
Whereas many philosophers now need to be reminded of the importance of
<EM>M</EM>, the importance of the present result <EM>N</EM> is obvious
to them all.  Indeed many philosophers, beginning with Hume himself,
believe that, or at least proceed as though, <EM>N</EM> is so devastating
a result about induction that the sceptical conclusion <EM>C</EM> follows
from it at once.  If induction really is, as <EM>N</EM> says it is,
not only invalid but incurably so, does it not follow that induction is
unreasonable, as <EM>C</EM> says it is?
</P>

<P>
Good philosophers have a very exacting standard of what constitutes
a reasonable argument; and other things being equal, one philosopher
is better than another, the <EM>more</EM> exacting his standard of
reasonable argument is.  The highest possible such standard would say,
that the premise of an argument is not a reason to believe the conclusion,
unless the argument is actually valid; and it is, accordingly to such
a standard as this that all good philosophers more or less incline.
They have the deepest reluctance, consequently, to admit that an argument
can be a reasonable one, if it is not only invalid, but cannot be turned
into a valid argument by any additional premise that can form part of a
reason to believe its conclusions.  Hence the admission of <EM>N</EM>,
that <EM>inductive</EM> arguments are all in this position, is bound
to impose at least some strain on any good philosopher's belief in
the reasonableness of induction.  It is natural, therefore, for a good
philosopher to think that <EM>C</EM> follows from <EM>N</EM>.  He will
even, other things being equal move from <EM>N</EM> to <EM>C</EM> the more
easily, the better philosopher he is.  There is nothing at all surprising,
then, but quite the reverse, in Hume and many other philosophers having
proceeded as though <EM>N</EM> entails <EM>C</EM>.
</P>

<P>
Nevertheless, some other philosophers (of whom I am one) resist this
step from <EM>N</EM> to <EM>C</EM>.  We have a less exacting standard of
reasonable argument than most philosophers incline to.  We say that an
argument can be invalid, and even incurably so, but still its premise
can be a reason to believe its conclusion.  It <EM>is</EM> so, we say,
with some inductive arguments in particular.  Hume's result <EM>N</EM>
we accept, and we admire it, as a profound truth about induction which
his argument brought to light.  But the sceptical conclusion <EM>C</EM>
which Hume drew from <EM>N</EM> does not follow, we say, and is false.
</P>

<P>
This kind of philosopher, the `inductive probabilist' as he may be called,
does not think of the invalidity of inductive arguments as a mere surface
blemish of them.  He knows better than that, for he has taken Hume's
result <EM>N</EM> to heart, and therefore holds that the invalidity of
induction is incurable.  Still less will he join those philosophers who
<EM>search for</EM> a validator of induction.  Invalidity which cannot be
cured, he considers, had better be endured.  On the other hand he still
maintains that some inductive arguments are reasonable, in the sense in
which <EM>C</EM> says that none are; that is, he maintains that their
premises are a reason to believe their conclusions.  Of course he does
not regard the reasonableness of those arguments as an <EM>extrinsic</EM>
feature of them: as consisting in the fact that some <EM>other</EM>
argument, which has the same conclusion and augmented premises, is
actually valid.  On the contrary, he regards the reasonableness of
those inductive arguments which are reasonable as an intrinsic logical
feature of them; just as, for example, their invalidity is.  So while
he admits that inductive arguments have an incurable infirmity, in that
it is possible for their premises to be true and conclusion false, he
does not obsessively concentrate on this logical feature of them to the
exclusion of every other [<A HREF="notes.html#04-24">24</A>].
</P>

<P>
But most philosophers, it must be admitted, consider the inductive
probabilist's position a feeble evasion, and one impossible to maintain.
Many suspect that the inductive probabilist, despite the lip-service he
pays to Hume, has never really taken in the full force of his argument.
Some even suspect that he is engaged, most embarrassingly, in defending
a position about induction Hume himself had already shown, in the course
of the very argument we are discussing, to be indefensible.
</P>

<P>
`Consider' (these critics say) `an inductive argument, for example that
from P, "All the many flames observed in the past have been hot", to Q
"Tomorrow's flames will be hot".  There is no connection whatever between
the premise and the conclusion.  P and Q are propositions entirely
logically independent of one another.  Nevertheless, you tell us, P is
a reason to believe Q.  Now, is it not obvious that, if this <EM>is</EM>
so, it is because there is some <EM>connection</EM> between past flames
and tomorrow's flames, or between being a flame and being hot, or between
the observed and the unobserved?  To make P a reason to believe Q, there
must be <EM>some</EM> ground in nature, some fact about the cosmos,
some "cement in the universe" (in Hume's phrase) which, taken along
with P, <EM>logically</EM> connects that premise with the conclusion
Q; that is, turns the original inductive argument into a valid one.
Yet you reject Hume's <EM>C</EM> while you accept his <EM>N</EM>.
There is no proposition, you say, which is at once part of a reason
to believe Q, and sufficient to make the argument from P to Q valid.
If so, then <EM>a fortiriori</EM> there is no <EM>true</EM> proposition
of that kind.  And what is this but to say that there is in the nature
of things <EM>no</EM> ground for inferring Q from P, or that P is
<EM>not</EM> a reason to believe Q?  Forbear these evasions, then, and
admit at any rate the truth of Hume's conditional, that if <EM>N</EM>
is true, <EM>C</EM> is: that if induction is really incurably invalid,
then it is unreasonable.  Or, if you persist in affirming <EM>N</EM> and
denying <EM>C</EM>, at least tell us what it is, according to you, which
<EM>makes it true</EM> that (for example) P is a reason to believe Q.
It cannot be, that the argument from P to Q is valid, or only curably
invalid; for you accept <EM>N</EM>, and insist that the argument is
not so.  What <EM>is</EM> it, then, that makes P a reason to believe Q?
If you tell me that it is just an ultimate fact of inductive logic, or
of the theory of probability, that P is a reason to believe Q, then I
will know what to think of your so-called inductive logic: that it is
simply speculative metaphysics in disguise'.
</P>

<P>
Criticism of this kind has often been thought to be fatal to inductive
probabilism.  Its plausibility must have been felt, at least at times,
even by the inductive probabilist himself.  It can fairly be summed
up thus: "If the universe were not connected or cemented in some way
(that is, if there were no true validator of at least some inductive
arguments), then Hume's scepticism about induction would be true".
</P>

<P>
Some of these critics of inductive probabilism have an
<EM>anti</EM>-sceptical intent.  They intend to go on to say that,
since Hume's inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> is plainly false, the
universe must in fact <EM>be</EM> cemented in some way.  (As to
the nature of the cement, they may and do differ.  Some of them
say it is causation; others that it is a certain connection that
exists between properties; others again that it is the providence of
God; etc.).  A second group of the critics of inductive probabilism
have a sceptical intent.  They mean to go on to say that, since the
universe is in fact <EM>not</EM> cemented or connected, Hume's inductive
scepticism <EM>C</EM> is <EM>true</EM>.  Of this second group, a recent
example is Popper, in <EM>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</EM> [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-25">25</A>].  Of the first, a recent example is
D.M.Armstrong [<A HREF="notes.html#04-26">26</A>].
</P>

<P>
For our purposes, however, the difference between these two groups of
critics does not matter.  What matters is what they agree on.  For this
can be shown to be a complete mistake.
</P>

<P>
What the critics of inductive probabilism unite in believing is, that
Hume's inductive scepticism would be true if the universe is not cemented
or connected in some way; or what is equivalent, that his inductive
scepticism would be false only if the universe <EM>were</EM> cemented
or connected.  That the universe is cemented or connected, whatever
exactly it means, is a proposition which is, as an additional premise,
sufficient to turn at least some inductive arguments into valid ones.
Inductive arguments, however, as well as being invalid, all have
contingent conclusions; and any additional premise, which is sufficient
to turn an invalid argument with a contingent conclusion into a valid
one, must be contingent itself.  It is therefore a contingent proposition
that the universe is cemented or connected.  Since the negation of any
contingent proposition is itself contingent, it is also a contingent
proposition that the universe is <EM>not</EM> cemented or connected.
Our critics therefore all imply that Hume's scepticism about induction
would be true if a certain contingent proposition ("no cement") is
true, false only if a certain contingent proposition ("cement") is true.
But a proposition which is true on a certain contingent condition and
false otherwise, is contingent itself.  All these critics therefore
imply that Hume's inductive scepticism is a contingent proposition.
</P>

<P>
But this is so extreme a misconception of the nature of Hume's <EM>C</EM>
that no one, I believe, will venture to defend it, once it is thus
explicitly stated.
</P>

<P>
On its very face it is most implausible.  Recall the proposition
<EM>C</EM>, or any of Hume's own words for it: for example, "even after
the observation of the frequent or constant conjunction of objects, we
have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those
of which we have had experience" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-27">27</A>].
This certainly does not <EM>appear</EM> to be a contingent claim about
the overall character of the actual universe.  It appears to be, rather,
a <EM>logical</EM> thesis of some kind: a proposition about whether
certain propositions are or are not a reason to believe certain other
propositions.
</P>

<P>
If <EM>C</EM> <EM>is</EM> contingent, then Hume's argument for it must
either have been invalid, or have had at least one contingent premise.
For remember, `there can be no <EM>demonstrative</EM> arguments for a
matter of fact and existence'!  That Hume's argument for C was valid,
we are assuming.  Where, then, is its contingent premise?  The reader
has only to recall <EM>E</EM>, <EM>F</EM>, <EM>G</EM>, <EM>H</EM>,
and <EM>J</EM>, to see that there is no contingent premise in Hume's
argument for <EM>C</EM>, according to my account of it above.  Nor is
there a contingent premise in Hume's argument for <EM>C</EM>, according
to any other account of it which is worthy of consideration in other
respects.  Such a premise, then, is not easy to find in Hume's argument
for inductive scepticism.  Yet if it were there at all, it must be a
<EM>huge</EM> one; since it has to entail a conclusion, <EM>C</EM>, which
on the present hypothesis is nothing less than a contingent proposition
about the entire universe.  We must ask to have this elusive giant---this
Yeti, as it were, among Hume's premises---pointed out to us.
</P>

<P>
But it is not really necessary to rely here on the method of challenge.
Any hope, or fear, that the challenge just issued might be met, can be
very easily extinguished.  For suppose that Hume's inductive scepticism
<EM>C</EM> <EM>were</EM> contingent.  Then, since what is says, it says
about <EM>any</EM> inductive argument, it would be a <EM>universal</EM>
proposition, as well as a contingent one.  Contingent universal
propositions, however, are a species of <EM>contingent propositions
about the unobserved</EM>; and we know what Hume here implies about all
of <EM>them</EM>.  His empiricism <EM>B</EM> says that only propositions
about the observed can be reason to believe them; and his inductive
scepticism <EM>C</EM> says that even propositions about the observed are
no reason to believe them.  On the hypothesis that <EM>C</EM> itself is
contingent, then, Hume's scepticism <EM>A</EM> about the unobserved,
which follows from <EM>B</EM> and <EM>C</EM>, would imply, concerning
inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> itself, that there is no reason to believe
<EM>it</EM>; any more than to believe, say, that tomorrow's flames will
be hot.
</P>

<P>
Well!  Philosophically, of course, no result could possibly be more
welcome than this, to any empiricist who denies inductive scepticism:
if only, as a matter of Hume-exegesis, he could believe it!  `Hume's
inductive scepticism, given his empiricism, entails that there is no
reason to believe his inductive scepticism': what an optimum result!
Alas, as a matter of exegesis of Hume, even the inductive probabilist
finds this far too good to be true.  Still less will any other student
of Hume be able to believe it.  Hume's inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM>,
however it is to be refuted, if indeed it can be refuted at all, is
certainly not a proposition which makes its own refutation unnecessary,
by committing suicide at birth in this obliging and even graceful manner.
It <EM>would</EM> be a proposition of exactly that kind, however, if it
were contingent.  Therefore it is not contingent.
</P>

<P>
It is not hard to see how the anti-sceptical critics of inductive
probabilism have been led into the exegetical absurdity just noticed.
They have not fully taken in Hume's result <EM>N</EM>.  No one
would search for a cement of the universe which would validate
inductive arguments, if he were once fully persuaded that anything
which <EM>was</EM> equal to that task would not be part of any
reason to believe the conclusions of induction.  The position of the
<EM>sceptical</EM> critics of inductive probabilism, such as Popper,
is much less intelligible.  They are empiricists, and even inductive
sceptics, yet somehow they have had revealed to them what they imply is
a natural law: that the cement-content of the universe is constant zero.
Criticism is superfluous in such a case.
</P>

<P>
Both groups of critics suppose, as I said earlier, that <EM>they</EM>
adhere more rigorously than the inductive probabilist does to the truths
about induction which Hume's argument can teach us.  In fact, as we have
now seen, the boot is on the other foot.  The inductive probabilist
has taken in, far better than his anti-sceptical critics, the truth
of Hume's result <EM>N</EM>.  And he has taken in, far better than
any of his critics, the non-contingent character of Hume's conclusion
<EM>C</EM>.  As for the belief that the inductive probabilist is trying
to revive a position refuted in advance by Hume himself, this is a
mere myth.  Its only foundation is ignorance of the texts; ignorance,
in particular, of what Hume meant by the phrase "probable arguments".
Far from having refuted inductive probabilism, Hume never so much
as considered it.  He scarcely could have done so, because inductive
probabilism came into being, in the modern period of philosophy, or
at least assumed a definite form, only in <EM>response</EM> to his
sceptical attack on induction [<A HREF="notes.html#04-28">28</A>].
Hume's <EM>only</EM> question about induction was, as I said earlier: what
can <EM>validate</EM> it (while being also part of a reason to believe
its conclusions)?  Finding, <EM>N</EM>, that nothing can, he forthwith
concluded <EM>C</EM>, that induction is unreasonable.  That inductive
arguments, or that any arguments, might be reasonable <EM>although</EM>
incurably invalid, is a position which Hume nowhere attempted to exclude
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-29">29</A>].
</P>

<P>
The inductive probabilist can easily show, too, that his critics' implied
philosophy of logic is no more satisfactory than their implied criticism
of Hume.
</P>

<P>
`You challenged me to say' (he might reply to his critics) `what makes
it true that "All the many flames observed in the past have been hot",
is a reason to believe "Tomorrow's flames will be hot"; or to say, in
general, what makes it true that Hume's inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM>
is false.  And in accordance with your misconception of the nature of
<EM>C</EM>, you were then demanding a <EM>contingent</EM> truth-maker
for this assertion of mine.  But inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> is not
a contingent proposition.  No more, then, is my denial of it contingent.
The negation of <EM>C</EM>, like <EM>C</EM> itself, a logical thesis in a
broad sense, and whichever one of the two is true, that proposition does
not require a contingent truth-maker, any more than other propositions
of the same kind do'.
</P>

<P>
`When we say' (he might continue), `as we all do say, and as Hume's
<EM>D</EM> implies, that a tautology, for example, is not a reason to
believe, "Tomorrow's flames will be hot", does <EM>this</EM> assertion
of ours require a ground in nature to make it true?  When we say, as
all philosophers do, that "All men are mortal and Socrates is mortal"
is not an absolutely conclusive reason to believe "Socrates is a man",
does this assertion depend for its truth on some cosmic contingency?
If it does, what <EM>is</EM> that contingent feature of the universe
which makes undistributed middle a fallacy?  Is it an unfortunate local
deficiency of cement, perhaps, or a vein of actual anti-cement which runs
through our fallen world?  When philosophers say, as almost all of them
do say, that "All men are mortal and Socrates is a man" is an absolutely
conclusive reason to believe "Socrates is mortal", does their assertion
require a contingent truth-maker?  If it does, then deductive logic too,
no less than non-deductive logic, will be `speculative metaphysics'.
To every one of these questions, the answer is obviously "no".  And no
more does my assertion, when I say that some propositions about the
observed are a reason to believe some contingent propositions about the
unobserved, require any contingent fact to make it true'.
</P>

<P>
There is one compromise, however, which the inductive probabilist can
and should offer to his critics.  He should undertake to reveal what the
contingent fact is, which makes the premises of some inductive arguments
<EM>a reason</EM> to believe their conclusions, on the very day that his
critics reveal what the contingent fact is, which makes the premise of
every inductive argument <EM>not an absolutely conclusive reason</EM>
to believe its conclusion.  Mutual disclosure of all contingent assets
is a fair principle.  Let the ground in nature of the reasonableness
of some induction be disclosed, then, in return for disclosure of the
ground in nature of the invalidity of all of them.
</P>

<P>
Nor is the inductive probabilist obliged to maintain, wherever the
premises of an induction <EM>is</EM> a reason to believe the conclusion,
that this is an <EM>ultimate</EM> logical feature of those arguments.
It may sometimes be possible to show that it is a <EM>derivative</EM>
one.  It may be possible, that is, to derive the conclusion that
certain inductive arguments are reasonable, from premises about the
reasonableness of certain <EM>non</EM>-inductive arguments.  Indeed,
it is already known (thanks originally to Bernoulli and Laplace [<A
HREF="notes.html#04-30">30</A>]) that this can in certain cases be done.
But any premise of such a derivation will be, like the conclusion of
it, a proposition not of a contingent but of a logical kind.  And even
where such a derivation is possible, the reasonableness of the inductive
arguments in question remains an intrinsic feature of them, even though
not an ultimate one.
</P>

<P>
The philosophical dispute between inductive probabilism and its
critics, as I have presented it, arose from a historical dispute,
about the interpretation of Hume's argument for inductive scepticism.
The question was whether, supposing induction to be incurably invalid,
as <EM>N</EM> says it is, it follows that induction is unreasonable, as
<EM>C</EM> says.  The inductive probabilist believes it does not follow.
Hume, and the critics of inductive probabilism, believe that it does.
But now, there is nothing to prevent us from condensing this whole cloud
of philosophy and of Hume-exegesis into a single drop of elementary logic.
Does <EM>C</EM> follow from <EM>N</EM>, or does it not?
</P>

<P>
Well, <EM>C</EM> says this: that the premise of an inductive argument is
not a reason to believe its conclusion.  <EM>N</EM> says this and only
this: that any inductive argument is invalid, and that no validator
of it is a reason or part of a reason to believe its conclusions.
But evidently, from the fact that no <EM>validator</EM> R, of an inductive
argument from P to Q, is a reason or part of a reason to believe Q, it
does not follow that the <EM>premise</EM> P <EM>itself</EM> is not a
reason to believe Q.  Yet this is what <EM>C</EM> says.  So <EM>C</EM>
does not follow from <EM>N</EM>.  The incurable invalidity of induction
is no proof of its unreasonableness.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
There is, therefore, a gap in Hume's argument for inductive scepticism
<EM>C</EM>.  Proceeding, as we are, on the assumption that the argument
which Hume intended was valid, we therefore have no alternative but
to suppose that his argument had some premise which he did not state:
some tacit assumption which, when it is added to his other premises, is
sufficient (and of course no more than is necessary) to turn his argument
for <EM>C</EM> into a valid one.  For our purposes it is necessary
to identify all the premises of his argument.  We need, therefore, to
identify this suppressed premise: the <EM>validator</EM> (for it is
nothing less) of Hume's own argument for scepticism about induction.
</P>

<P>
The <EM>general</EM> nature of this missing premise is obvious enough.
One who believes that <EM>C</EM> follows from <EM>N</EM> regards it
as necessary, in order for the premise of an argument to be a reason
to believe the conclusion, that the argument be valid, or at least
not incurably invalid.  One who denies that <EM>C</EM> follows from
<EM>N</EM>, denies that this <EM>is</EM> a necessary condition for an
argument to be reasonable.  The former philosophers therefore (as was
said earlier) have a higher or more exacting standard than the latter,
of what it is for the premise of an argument to be a reason to believe
its conclusion.  As we called the latter, with obvious propriety,
`inductive probabilists', so we may call the former `deductivists'.
For their standard of a reasonable argument, whatever exactly it may
be, is one which demands that, if P is a reason to believe Q, then Q is
<EM>deducible</EM> either from P itself, or from P along with such limited
additional premises as can be themselves part of a reason to believe Q.
Hume, since he believes that <EM>C</EM> follows from <EM>N</EM>, is one
of these deductivist philosophers.  We are therefore entitled to call the
unexpressed assumption, which enabled him to mistake the argument from
<EM>N</EM> to <EM>C</EM> for a valid one, Hume's <EM>deductivist</EM>
premise; even though it is yet to be determined exactly what it says.
</P>

<P>
The presence of such an assumption in Hume's argument, as it is obvious,
has often been noticed.  Many writers have detected, not only in his
argument for inductive scepticism, but elsewhere in Hume's philosophy,
the influence of an inexplicit standard, of a `high' or `deductivist'
or `rationalist' kind, as to what constitutes a reasonable argument.
Thus one writer says, for example, that in Hume's argument for inductive
scepticism, "the tacit assumption [was that] all rational inference
is deductive" [<A HREF="notes.html#04-31">31</A>].  Another says that
Hume's assumption was, that "arguments are deductive or defective"
[<A HREF="notes.html#04-32">32</A>].  Many other writers could easily
be cited to the same effect.
</P>

<P>
The last-quoted version of Hume's deductivism is too vague to be of any
use to us; for the writer does not explain, and it is not obvious, what
he means by "defective".  The previously-quoted one is identical with
the version of deductivism which, in my earlier-published account of
this argument, I myself attributed to Hume.  For I there concluded that
Hume's unstated premise was, that an argument is reasonable only if it
is valid; or in other words, that P is a reason to believe Q, only if
Q is deducible from P [<A HREF="notes.html#04-33">33</A>].
</P>

<P>
But it is easy to see, in the light of the more detailed account of Hume's
argument which has been given here, that this identification is wrong.
This simple version of deductivism makes Hume assume both too much
and too little.  Too little, because it takes no notice at all of the
distinction between arguments which are (simply) invalid, and arguments
which are <EM>incurably</EM> so.  Too much, because it is, evidently,
stronger than <EM>the</EM> validator of the argument from <EM>N</EM>
to <EM>C</EM>.  (To attribute it to Hume is therefore to attribute to
him more than is needed to make his argument valid: a serious fault in
exegesis).  And both of these defects, it will be obvious, arise from
the same source: namely, that this version of deductivism `engages' only
with the <EM>first</EM> clause of <EM>N</EM> (that inductive arguments
are invalid).  Hence on this identification of Hume's deductivism, the
second clause of <EM>N</EM>, which adds that the invalidity of induction
is incurable, plays no essential part in his argument at all.
</P>

<P>
But on the contrary, it is the second clause of <EM>N</EM> which Hume's
entire argument had been directed to establishing; not the first clause
of it, the <EM>mere</EM> fact that inductive arguments are invalid.
<EM>That</EM> was assumed from the outset, in Hume's premise <EM>G</EM>.
What Hume argued for, and argued successfully for, was <EM>I</EM> and
<EM>K</EM>: that <EM>the validator</EM> of inductive arguments is neither
necessarily true nor observational.  It was <EM>this</EM> result, combined
with his assumption, which follows from <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>, that
it is <EM>only</EM> necessary truths and observation-statements which
can be even part of a reason to believe another proposition, from which
Hume validly inferred that the invalidity of induction cannot be cured
at all; that is, <EM>N</EM>.  And some deductivist assumption, the exact
nature of which we wish to identify, conjoined with <EM>N</EM> and perhaps
with some other premises of his argument, then carried Hume to inductive
scepticism <EM>C</EM>.
</P>

<P>
With this recapitulation of Hume's argument before us, then, let us ask
afresh, what is the assumption, of a deductivist kind, which is implicit
in the argument?
</P>

<P>
The conclusion to be reached, <EM>C</EM>, says that the premise of an
inductive argument is not <EM>a reason to believe</EM> its conclusion.
We ought, therefore, in trying to identify the missing deductivist
premise of the argument for this conclusion, to take account not only
of <EM>N</EM>, but of anything which the <EM>already-identified</EM>
premises of the argument say, about what is required in order for one
proposition to be a reason to believe another.  <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>
contain everything there is of that kind, in the premises of the argument
which have been already identified.  We ought therefore, in trying to
identify the deductivist assumption which supervened between <EM>N</EM>
and <EM>C</EM>, to take <EM>N</EM> not on its own, but in conjunction
with <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>.
</P>

<P>
Once this is done, the missing premise stands out clearly.  The most that
is entailed about inductive arguments by the conjunction of <EM>E</EM>
and <EM>F</EM>, is:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>M+</EM>: Any inductive argument is invalid, and any validator of it
is neither a necessary truth not a proposition about the observed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(I call this <EM>M+</EM> because it says, about <EM>any</EM> validator
of inductive arguments, just what <EM>M</EM> says about the weakest one).
The missing deductivist premise is therefore the validator of the argument
from <EM>M+</EM> to <EM>C</EM>.  That proposition is evidently:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>O</EM>: P is a reason to believe Q only if the argument from P to
Q is valid, or there is a validator of it which is either a necessary
truth or a proposition about the observed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This proposition, therefore, is Hume's deductivist premise.
</P>

<P>
In order to satisfy ourselves of this, it is sufficient to cast our
minds back over Hume's argument, and ask ourselves the following simple
question.  What, after all, did Hume have <EM>against</EM> inductive
arguments?  What <EM>is</EM> it, at bottom, about inductive arguments,
which elicits from him the dire verdict <EM>C</EM> against them?
Well, certainly not the mere fact that they are not valid.  <EM>That</EM>
feature of them was taken for granted by Hume (in premise <EM>G</EM>)
from the start, and is, besides, a feature, unimportant in itself, which
inductive arguments share with many arguments that neither Hume or anyone
else condemns; for example, the argument mentioned earlier, about the bird
on the post.  No, what makes inductive arguments unreasonable in Hume's
eyes is that, precisely <EM>unlike</EM> the argument about the bird on
the post, <EM>their</EM> invalidity cannot be cured by any additional
premise which might be supplied either by <EM>a priori</EM> knowledge
or by experience.  <EM>That</EM> was what Hume has against induction.
Which is to say that he assumed that, if an argument is a reasonable one,
it is either valid, or can be made so by an additional premise which
is either necessarily true or observational.  Which is to say that his
tacit assumption of a deductivist kind was <EM>O</EM>; and that what
that premise engaged with was <EM>M+</EM>.
</P>

<P>
In the presence of <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>, <EM>N</EM> entails
<EM>M+</EM>; but equally, in the presence of <EM>E</EM> and
<EM>F</EM>, <EM>M+</EM> entails <EM>N</EM>.  In other words, given
Hume's assumptions, that a reason to believe another proposition must
be directly accessible to knowledge or reasonable belief, and that all
and only observation-statements and necessary truths are so directly
accessible, <EM>M+</EM> and <EM>N</EM> are logically equivalent.  From a
logical point of view, therefore, it is immaterial whether we regard
deductivist <EM>O</EM> as engaging with <EM>N</EM> or with <EM>M+</EM>;
that is, whether we regard the last step of Hume's argument for <EM>C</EM>
as having the structure:
</P>

<PRE>
    E }
    F }
    N } -&gt; C
    O }
</PRE>

<P>
or the structure:
</P>

<PRE>
    E }
    F } -&gt; M+ }
    N }    O  } -&gt; C
</PRE>

<P>
The structure, then, of Hume's argument for inductive scepticism was
the following:
</P>

<PRE>
                              E }
    H }                E }    F } -&gt; M+ }
    J } ------&gt; I }    F } -&gt; N }    O  } -&gt; C
                  } -&gt; M }
    H } -&gt; L -&gt; K }
    G }
</PRE>

<P>
It is important to realize, as was pointed out earlier, that it is
possible consistently to be an inductive sceptic without being a sceptic
about the unobserved; that is, that <EM>A</EM> does not follow from
<EM>C</EM> alone, but only from <EM>C</EM> conjoined with empiricism
<EM>B</EM>.  In the same way it is important to realize that it is
possible consistently to be a deductivist, without being an inductive
sceptic; that is, that <EM>C</EM> does not follow from <EM>O</EM> alone,
but only from <EM>O</EM> conjoined with <EM>M+</EM>, which says that no
validator of induction is either necessarily true or observational.
</P>

<P>
It ought to be obvious that <EM>C</EM> does not follow from <EM>O</EM>.
For deductivism <EM>O</EM> says nothing about inductive arguments,
or indeed about any particular class of arguments, at all.  All it
does is to allege that a certain condition is necessary in order for
an argument to be a reasonable one.  Clearly, this on its own cannot
entail that some particular class of arguments satisfies, or fails to
satisfy, that condition.  It is only when <EM>O</EM> is conjoined with
<EM>M+</EM>, which <EM>is</EM> about inductive arguments, and says of them
that they <EM>fail</EM> to satisfy the condition demanded by <EM>O</EM>
for reasonable arguments, that <EM>C</EM>, the unreasonableness of
induction, follows.
</P>

<P>
It ought to be equally obvious that <EM>C</EM> does not entail <EM>O</EM>,
either.  <EM>C</EM> says only that inductive arguments are unreasonable.
From such a proposition as that, it is evidently impossible to deduce
any positive condition which arguments in general must satisfy in order
to <EM>be</EM> reasonable.  But such a condition is precisely what
<EM>O</EM> lays down.
</P>

<P>
Deductivism <EM>O</EM> and inductive scepticism <EM>C</EM> are, then,
neither of them deducible from the other.  These facts are important.
For these two theses, although in fact independent, are nowadays
often, or rather, usually, inextricably confused with one another.
The historical reason for this confusion is, of course, just the fact
that the two theses <EM>are</EM> closely connected in the context
of Hume's argument about induction, while that argument is nowadays
vividly, though confusedly, present in the minds of most philosophers.
Hence nowadays the deductivist believes himself obliged to be a sceptic
about induction; the friend of induction believes himself bound to
reject deductivism; the inductive sceptic imagines himself bound to
be a deductivist; the enemy of deductivism considers himself safe from
inductive scepticism; and every single one of these beliefs is false.
It is scarcely possible, in fact, to overestimate the damage which
has been done, in the way of positive error but even more in the way
of mere confusion, by the failure to recognize that deductivism, and
scepticism about induction, are separate theses.  And this damage has
been inflicted, not only on our ability to understand Hume's argument
about induction, but also, and even more importantly, on what is based
on that argument: 20th century philosophy of science.
</P>

<P>
It is the mistaken belief that <EM>O</EM> entails <EM>C</EM>, rather
than the converse belief, which has been the more productive of error
and confusion.  This belief has had the effect, among others, of making
unintelligible to most philosophers nowadays a philosophy of science which
is as recent, as influential, and as intelligible, as that of J.S.Mill.
For the kind of position which was pointed out (three paragraphs back)
as a logically possible one, namely deductivism without inductive
scepticism, was in fact that of Mill.  What Mill really believed, as
was indicated earlier, is that <EM>M+</EM> (and even <EM>M</EM>) is
<EM>false</EM>.  That is, he thought that the deterministic validator
of eliminative induction (such as the argument about the dead canary)
was <EM>observational</EM>.  <EM>That</EM> is why he could consistently
be, what he was, a deductivist and yet no sceptic about induction.

<P>
Now, among the premises of Hume's argument for inductive scepticism
<EM>C</EM>, which one is the key to the scepticism or irrationalism of
that conclusion?  What is that premise, without which this argument
would have neither <EM>C</EM> nor any other irrationalist thesis as
a consequence?
</P>

<P>
Well, the only premises of the argument for <EM>C</EM> are <EM>G</EM>,
<EM>H</EM>, and <EM>J</EM>, <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>, and <EM>O</EM>.
</P>

<P>
The first five of these premises, however, entail nothing of a sceptical
or irrationalist kind about induction.  They entail, indeed, <EM>M+</EM>,
that the invalidity of induction is incurable by any observation-statement
or necessary truth.  And they entail, what is equivalent to <EM>M+</EM>
in the presence of <EM>E</EM> and <EM>F</EM>, <EM>N</EM>, that the
invalidity of any inductive argument is incurable by any additional
premise which is even part of a reason to believe its conclusion.
But these results <EM>M+</EM> and <EM>N</EM> are the most that these
five premises entail about induction.  And these is nothing sceptical
or irrationalist about either of them.  They do not entail <EM>C</EM>.
(They say, indeed, no more than is acknowledged nowadays by almost
all philosophers, and not just by inductive sceptics: that induction
`cannot be turned into deduction').
</P>

<P>
Thus before the sole remaining premise, deductivism <EM>O</EM>, comes
into the argument, there is nothing to necessitate <EM>C</EM> or any
other irrationalist conclusion about induction.  Once that assumption
does come in, however, it engages with <EM>M+</EM>, and scepticism
<EM>C</EM> concerning induction is an inevitable result.  It is,
therefore, deductivism which is the key premise of Hume's argument for
inductive scepticism.
</P>

<P>
Nothing fatal to empiricist philosophy of science, in other words, follows
from the admission that arguments from the observed to the unobserved are
<EM>not the best</EM>; unless this assumption was combined, as it was with
Hume, with the fatal assumption that <EM>only the best will do</EM>.

Finally, it is worthwhile, for the sake of getting an overall view
of Hume's argument for scepticism about the unobserved <EM>A</EM>,
to put together the two parts of its structure-diagram: the argument
for <EM>B</EM>, and the argument for <EM>C</EM>.  This is done below.
For convenience of reference, all the elements of the argument are also
listen below: and I have here given each of them a summary title, which
may be found helpful.
