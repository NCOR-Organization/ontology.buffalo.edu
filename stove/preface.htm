<P>
This book is about a recent tendency in the philosophy of science: that
tendency of which the leading representatives are Professor Sir Karl
Popper, the late Professor Imre Lakatos, and Professors T.S.Kuhn and
P.K.Feyerabend.
</P>

<P>
These authors' philosophy of science is in substance irrationalist. They
doubt, or deny outright, that there can be any reason to believe any
scientific theory; and <EM>a fortiori</EM> they doubt or deny, for
example, that there has been any accumulation of knowledge in recent
centuries.
</P>

<P>
Yet, with a partial exception in the case of Feyerabend, these
writers are not at all widely recognized by their readers as being
irrationalists. Indeed, this is so far from being generally recognized,
that Popper, for example, is actually believed by most of his readers
to be an opponent of irrationalism about science.
</P>

<P>
It is from these two facts that the question arises to which Part One of
this book is addressed: namely, how have these writers succeeded in making
irrationalism about science acceptable to readers, most of whom would
reject it out of hand if it were presented to them without disguise?
</P>

<P>
My answer to this question is: by means of two literary devices which
are characteristic of their writings. These two devices are respectively
the subjects of Chapters I and II, which together make up Part One.
</P>

<P>
Part Two of the book is addressed to the question: what intellectual
influence led these writers <EM>themselves</EM> to embrace irrationalism
about science?
</P>

<P>
It should therefore be evident that both of the questions to which
this book is addressed, although they are <EM>about</EM> a certain kind
of philosophy, are not philosophical questions, but purely historical
ones.
</P>

<P>
This fact seemed to me to need to be emphasised in a preface, because
I have heard a sensible person object to Chapter I by saying that it is
"merely verbal criticism" of the philosophers in question. This objection
might have been well-founded, and at least would have been a relevant one,
if <EM>criticism</EM> of these authors' philosophy had been my principal
object, or even an essential part of my principal object, in Chapter
I. But that is not so. In all of Part One, as in Part Two, my principal
object is simply to answer a certain <EM>historical</EM> question.
