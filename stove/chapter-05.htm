<P>
Recapitulating the conclusions of the preceding chapter, but omitting now
the details of the sub-arguments for empiricism and for the fallibility
of induction, Hume's argument was the following:
</P>

<PRE>
    Fallibility of }
      Induction    }
                   } -&gt; Inductive Scepticism }
    Deductivism    }                         } -&gt; Scepticism about
                        Empiricism           }      the Unobserved
</PRE>

<P>
That is, the immediate grounds of his scepticism about the unobserved
were the thesis that only propositions about the observed can be a
reason to believe anything about the unobserved, plus the thesis that
even they are not such a reason.  And for this latter sceptical thesis,
his ultimate grounds were premises which entail that the invalidity of
inductive arguments is incurable by any additional premises which are
either observational or necessarily true; plus the assumption that the
premise of an argument is no reason to believe its conclusion, unless
the argument is valid, or can be made so by additional premises which are
either observation-statements or necessary truths.  But from empiricism,
or from inductive fallibilism, or from their conjunction, no sceptical
or irrationalist consequence follows.  When they are combined with
deductivism, however, first scepticism about induction follows, and then
scepticism concerning any contingent proposition about the unobserved.
The key premise of Hume's argument, therefore, in the sense of being
that premise without which the argument would have no sceptical or
irrationalist consequences, is deductivism.
</P>

<P>
All of this is exactly true of Popper as well.  His irrationalism
about scientific theories is no other than Hume's scepticism concerning
contingent propositions about the unobserved; nor are his grounds for it
other than Hume's.  Popper is no less an empiricist than Hume: he does not
believe, any more than Hume did, that any propositions <EM>except</EM>
observation-statements can be a reason to believe a scientific theory.
And at the same time he is, as he is always telling us, a Humean sceptic
about arguments from the observed to the unobserved.  For this inductive
scepticism in its turn, Popper's argument is just, as he tells us, that
`flawless gem' of an argument which was Hume's: from the fact that
inductive arguments are invalid, and that this condition cannot be
cured by additional premises either observational or necessarily true;
plus the deductivist assumption that if an argument is of this kind,
then its premises is no reason to believe its conclusion.  In Popper's
philosophy of science, therefore, as in Hume's, the premises on which
all the irrationalist consequences depend is deductivism.  And since
our other authors' philosophy of science is derived almost entirely from
Popper's, deductivism is the key to their irrationalism too.
</P>

<P>
Recent irrationalist philosophy of science is therefore to be ascribed
(insofar as it can be ascribed to intellectual causes at all) to
acceptance of the thesis of deductivism.  What has been decisive in
leading these authors to conclude that there can be no reasonable belief
in a scientific theory, and <EM>a fortiriori</EM> that there has been no
accumulation of knowledge in the last few centuries, is a certain extreme
belief, by which their minds are dominated, about what is required for
one proposition to be a reason to believe another.
</P>

<P>
The <EM>truth</EM> of the key premise of our authors' philosophy is
not (as was said at the beginning of this Part) a question with which
this book is concerned.  But we have now at least <EM>identified</EM>
the proposition to which criticism of their philosophy, if it is not
to be entirely indecisive, needs to be directed.  To criticize our
authors on the basis of the history of science, for example, is sure
to be in practice indecisive at best, but is futile even in principle.
For the assumption on which everything distinctive of their philosophy
rests is in fact one which has nothing at all to do with science, and
least of all with the history of science.  It is a simple thesis in the
philosophy of <EM>logic</EM> or of <EM>reasonable inference</EM>, and it
is nothing more.  It has not even, it should be emphasized, any necessary
connection with the subject of <EM>inductive</EM> inference; for, as
was pointed out near the end of the preceding chapter, deductivism is
a thesis logically independent of inductive scepticism.
</P>

<P>
Deductivism, is not, of course, <EM>explicit</EM> in Popper's writings;
though it is more nearly so there than it is with Hume.  At the same time
I know of no reason to doubt that Popper would accept the attribution of
that thesis to him.  Of course virtually no philosopher nowadays, if he
were to embrace deductivism explicitly, would bother to retain that part
of it which refers to <EM>necessary truths</EM> as possible validators
of arguments.  On the contrary, philosophers now assume that the addition
of a necessary truth of the premises of an invalid argument will never
turn it into a valid one.  The reason is, that the conjunction of any
necessarily true R to any P is logically equivalent to P itself; and that
two arguments cannot differ in logical value, and hence one of them cannot
be valid and the other not, if they have logically equivalent premises and
the same conclusion.  Accordingly I too will henceforth omit the phrase
"[...] or necessary truths" from the thesis of deductivism; and when I
sometimes in the following pages call an argument <EM>incurably</EM>
invalid, I will here mean just that no additional premise which is
<EM>observational</EM> would turn it into a valid argument.

<P>
I have now given my answer to the question to which Part Two of this
book is addressed: how did our authors come to embrace irrationalist
philosophy of science?  My answer is, through embracing deductivism.
My main grounds for thinking this answer correct are those which have
now been given: that our authors' irrationalism about science is derived
from Hume, and that the key premise of Hume's irrationalist philosophy
of science is deductivism.
</P>

<P>
But there are other grounds as well for thinking this answer correct.
These are, in sum, that it explains extremely well a number of prominent
and distinctive features of our authors' writings, including some features
which seem at first quite unconnected with deductivism, or even opposed
to it.  This is what I now intend to show.
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><BIG>2</BIG></DIV>

<P>
First, the deductivism of our authors is what ultimately necessitated
those two devices which were the subject of Part One above, and which
are those authors' literary hall-mark.
</P>

<P>
If you are a deductivist, then you cannot allow yourself to
use, in earnest, the word "confirms", or any of the weak or
non-deductive-logical expressions.  To say of an observation-statement
<EM>O</EM> that is confirms a scientific theory <EM>T</EM>, entails
that those two propositions stand in some logical relation such that
<EM>O</EM> is a reason to believe <EM>T</EM>.  But this cannot be
so if deductivism is true, in view of the truth of the fallibilist
thesis, that neither <EM>O</EM>, nor <EM>O</EM> conjoined with any other
observation-statements, entails <EM>T</EM>.  So instead of saying that
<EM>O</EM> confirms <EM>T</EM>, a deductivist, at least if he is resolved,
as our authors are, not to be openly and constantly irrationalist about
science, must often write that <EM>O</EM> `confirms' <EM>T</EM>; or
write that <EM>scientists regard T</EM> as confirmed by <EM>O</EM>; or
write something, anyway, which, while it purports to be a statement of
logic, is in fact nothing of the kind.  In other words, he must often
sabotage the logical expression `confirms'.
</P>

<P>
In this way, all logical pipes, along which reasonable belief might travel
from observation to scientific theories, are cut by deductivism.  But our
authors are also empiricists, and do not for a moment suppose that there
are any sources, <EM>other than</EM> observation, from which reasonable
belief in scientific theories might come.  And neither they nor anyone
else, of course, suppose that scientific theories are <EM>directly</EM>
accessible to knowledge or reasonable belief.  According to these authors,
therefore, reasonable belief cannot accrue to scientific theories in any
way at all.  And that is why <EM>success-words</EM>, like "knowledge" and
"discovery", which imply that reasonable belief <EM>has</EM> accrued to
the propositions which are their objects, <EM>must</EM> be neutralized
by our authors when they are employed in connection with science; or,
if not neutralized, then simply avoided altogether.
</P>

<P>
We thus see that, of our authors' two devices for making irrationalism
plausible, the primary one is the sabotage of logical expressions:
the need to neutralize success-words is consequential upon that.
But the sabotage of logical expressions is in its turn necessitated by
a substantive philosophical thesis; and that is deductivism.
</P>

<P>
It has been widely recognized, and was admitted at the beginning of this
book, that the answer in <EM>general</EM> terms to the question, "How
have these authors made irrationalism plausible to their readers?", is:
by fostering the confusion of questions of logical value with questions
of historical fact, or of the philosophy with the history of science.
I undertook to show <EM>in detail</EM> how this trick is turned.
This has now been done.  For, of our authors' devices for making
irrationalism plausible, the basic one, we have now found, is the
sabotage of logical expressions; their favorite way of doing this, we
saw in Chapter II, is by embedding a statement of logic in an epistemic
context about scientists; and now, the effect of that is, precisely,
to disguise historical statements as logical ones.  Thus for example,
the schematic logical statement, "Observation-statement <EM>O</EM>
confirms theory <EM>T</EM>", attributes a certain logical value to the
argument from <EM>O</EM> to <EM>T</EM>; but its ghost-logical surrogate,
"Scientists regard <EM>T</EM> as confirmed by <EM>O</EM>", for all its
artful suggestions of logic, is nothing but a historical proposition
after all.
</P>

<P>
A deductivist philosopher of science, if he is an empiricist and an
inductive fallibilist, <EM>must</EM> sabotage logical expressions which
are weak.  But even the strong or deductive-logical expression will almost
inevitably undergo misuse at his hands.  Recall the `primal scene' of the
sabotage of a deductive-logical expression: that is, Popper contemplating
the logical relation between E, "The relative frequency of males among
births in human history so far is 0.51", and H, "The probability of a
human birth being male is 0.9".  A deductivist cannot say, what anyone
else can and would say, that E is a reason to believe that H is false.
For this cannot be true if deductivism is true; since neither E nor the
conjunction of E with any other observation-statement entails not-H.
What, then, <EM>is</EM> the deductivist to say about the relation between
E and H?  Since "falsifies" entails "is inconsistent with", he cannot,
for the fallibilist reason just mentioned, say without falsity that E
falsifies H.  Being cut off from using <EM>weak</EM> logical expressions,
he cannot say, what is of course true, that E disconfirms H, or confirms
not-H.  Rather, then, than write down nothing at all, or something which
is obviously false, the deductivist, very understandably, writes instead
that E `falsifies' H; or that any scientists would <EM>regard</EM> E
as falsifying H; or else he himself `proposes' that E be regarded as
falsifying H.
</P>

<P>
In this way, the cast of mind which will acknowledge only
deductive-logical relations between propositions back-fires, so to
speak, on its own possessors.  It obliges them, on pain of suffering
the fate which to them is even worse, of acknowledging non-deductive
logical relations, to misuse those very logical expressions which
they themselves regard as being the only admissible ones.  This is the
phenomenon referred to in Chapter II above, of deductivists being obliged
in the end to strangle their own children.
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><BIG>3</BIG></DIV>

<P>
There are, of course, very few people who believe that deductivism is
true.  The human race at large is decidedly of the opposite opinion, and
holds that there are extremely numerous values of P, Q, and R, such that
P is a reason to believe Q, without Q being entailed either by P or by
P-and-R for some observational R.  Confirmation-theory, or non-deductive
logic, or `inductive' logic as Carnap called it, is the attempt to put
into systematic form the very many intuitive beliefs which everyone has
about when P is a reason to believe Q.  Our authors entertain a boundless
hostility and contempt for non-deductive logic; and the explanation of
this fact lies, of course, in their deductivism.
</P>

<P>
Carnap speaks of `inductive' logic, because he chose to use the word
"inductive", as his Glossary indicates [<A HREF="notes.html#05-1">1</A>],
simply as a synonym for "non-deductive".  This is a neologism which was
apparently unconscious, and which has nothing at all to recommend it.
There is nothing to be said for calling the argument, for example, to
"Socrates is a man", from "All men are mortal and Socrates is mortal",
"inductive"; nor for calling so the argument to "Socrates is mortal" from
"99% of men are mortal and Socrates is a man".  But there is a great deal
to be said against it.  It suggests, what is false, that non-deductive
logic is concerned exclusively with arguments from the observed to
the unobserved; whereas this class of arguments, for all its special
importance for empiricist philosophers of science, is only one among many
classes of non-deductive arguments.  It suggests, what is false, that the
thesis of the incurable invalidity of inductive arguments is an analytic
triviality; which it is so far from being that Mill and many others, as
we saw in Chapter IV, have by implication denied it.  And it therefore
further suggests, what is also false, that deductivism, and scepticism
about induction, are logically equivalent theses; whereas they are, as
we have seen, actually independent.  These consequences suffice to show
that Carnap's neologism was tragically inept.  But it has acquired too
much currency to be soon reversed, and accordingly I adopt it here;
though never without a protest in the form of quotation-marks around
"inductive", whenever I use it as an adjective to "logic" or "logicians".
</P>

<P>
The chief land-marks of `inductive' logic are Carnap's <EM>Logical
Foundations of Probability</EM> (1950), and the articles of Hempel
which are collected in <EM>Aspects of Scientific Explanation</EM> [<A
HREF="notes.html#05-2">2</A>].  Now these writings, despite both their
self-imposed limitations and their consequent essentially fragmentary
nature, and despite some positive errors which they undoubtedly contain,
represent far more progress, in an area of the first intellectual
importance, than the entire history of the human race can show before.
Their only serious fore-runners, indeed, are some of the writings which
belong to the `classical' period of the theory of probability, between
1650 and 1850.  And what immense strides Carnap, in particular, made,
in clarifying, in improving, and in extending, <EM>that</EM> priceless
but profoundly confused historical deposit, many students of probability
know; even if others do not.  Not contempt, then, but rather all honor,
is due to these writers, for the mighty fragments of non-deductive logic
which they have left us.
</P>

<P>
But even if Carnap, Hempel, and their followers, had achieved, as their
deductivist critics allege that they have achieved, nothing constructive
at all in the way of systematic non-deductive logic, they would still
merit the respect which is due to their having been <EM>in earnest</EM>
with empiricist philosophy of science.  There can be no serious
philosophy, of science or of anything else, without seriousness about
the logical relations between propositions.  And there can be no serious
<EM>empiricist</EM> philosophy of <EM>science</EM>, in particular, without
seriousness about the <EM>non-deductive</EM> logical relations between
propositions.  Arguments from the observed to the unobserved really are
incurably invalid: <EM>this</EM> much of Hume's philosophy of science
is true, and in this much all empiricists are now agreed.  But, this
much being agreed, any empiricist who is also a <EM>deductivist</EM>,
as all our authors are, condemns himself, not just to irrationalism,
but to unseriousness, about science.
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><BIG>4</BIG></DIV>

<P>
Hostility to non-deductive logic, and the sabotaging of
non-deductive-logical expressions, are among the inevitable consequences
of our authors' deductivism.  But there are also two marked and
characteristic features of our authors' writings which, although not
inevitable consequences of their deductivism, can only be explained
by reference to it, or to that cast of mind which acknowledges only
deductive-logical relations between propositions.
</P>

<P>
One of these features, and one which is at first sight surprising in
deductivists, is this: an extreme lack of rigor in matters of deductive
logic.
</P>

<P>
As evidence of this fact, I could of course cite again all the cases,
already mentioned in Chapter II, in which a deductive-logical expression
is sabotaged by our authors; all the cases, for example, in which they
say that one proposition or kind of proposition `falsifies' another, when
they know well enough that the two are not inconsistent.  But obviously
it would be preferable, if it is possible, to draw here on entirely
independent evidence; and this is not only possible but easy.  I will give
three instances of the extreme lack of rigor of which I speak.  All three
are drawn from Popper, who is the most rigorous of our authors.
</P>

<P>
(1) Two scientific theories can be inconsistent with one another.
This fact is too obvious to need examples to prove it.  Nor has any
philosopher assumed this obvious truth more often than Popper does.
His writings are full of references to incompatible, or conflicting,
or competing, or rival, scientific theories.  Nor is this an accident.
For his entire philosophy of science in fact arose (as we saw in Chapter
III) from contemplating, over and over again as in a nightmare, the
overthrow of Newtonian physics by a rival theory; this <EM>kind</EM>
of episode in the history of science has always remained his principal
concern; and he thinks (as we saw in Chapter II) that the overthrow of one
scientific theory always requires the presence of an incompatible theory.
</P>

<P>
At the same time, it is an immediate and obvious consequence of
the account which Popper gives of the logical form of scientific
theories, that one scientific theory <EM>cannot</EM> be inconsistent
with another.
</P>

<P>
This account was given by Popper in his [1959], and has since then been
taken for granted in all his writings.  According to it, any scientific
theory, and equally any law-statement (for Popper always lumps these two
together) is what we may call "a mere denial of existence".  That is, it
is a proposition which denies the existence of a certain kind of thing,
and which does not assert the existence of anything.
</P>

<P>
"(x)(Raven x =&gt; Black x)" will suffice as an example of this class of
propositions.  Since it is logically equivalent to "There are no non-black
ravens", it denies the existence of a certain kind of thing; and since,
for the same reason, it would be true (as philosophers say) "in the
empty universe", that is, if nothing at all existed, it does not assert
the existence of anything.  Hence it is a mere denial of existence.
</P>

<P>
That Popper does conceive scientific theories and laws as mere denials
of existence, the following quotation is sufficient to establish.
"The theories of natural science, and especially what we call natural
laws, have the form of strictly universal statements; thus they can be
expressed in the form of negations of strictly existential statements,
or, as we may say, in the form of <EM>non-existence statements</EM>
(or `there-is-not' statements).  For example, the law of conservation
of energy can be expressed in the form: `There is no perpetual motion
machine', or the hypothesis of the electrical elementary charge in
the form: `There is no electrical charge other than a multiple of
the electrical elementary charge'.  In this formulation we see that
natural laws might be compared to `proscriptions' or `prohibitions'.
They do not assert that something exists or is the case; they deny it.
They insist on the non-existence of certain things or states of affairs,
proscribing or prohibiting, as it were, these things or states of affairs:
they rule them out" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-3">3</A>].
</P>

<P>
But now, two mere denials of existence cannot be inconsistent with one
another.  For in the logically possible case of the empty universe, all
such propositions would be true.
</P>

<P>
Hence Popper, while he constantly assumes that two scientific theories,
or two law-statements, can be inconsistent with one another, gives an
account of the logical form of such propositions which immediately has, by
the most elementary deductive logic, the consequence that they cannot.
</P>

<P>
(2) Let us call the conjunction of Newton's laws of motion with his
inverse-square law of gravitational attraction, "Newtonian physics".
And let us consider the question of whether Newtonian physics in this
sense is falsifiable; the question, that is, whether there is any
observation-statement which is inconsistent with Newtonian physics.
</P>

<P>
Even allowing for the differences in detail which exist among philosophers
as to what counts as an observation-statement, it is obvious enough that
the answer to this question is "no".  There can be no <EM>observably</EM>
non-Newtonian behavior, on the part of billiard balls or of anything else.
(There could, of course, be non-Newtonian behavior, for example a billiard
ball coming to rest with no forces acting on it; but then, that there are
no forces acting on this ball, is a theoretical generalization, and hence
cannot be part of an <EM>observation</EM>-statement).  That Newtonian
physics is unfalsifiable, is also evident from the fact that, however
oddly billiard balls might behave on a given occasion, Newtonian physics
could form part of the deductive <EM>explanation</EM> of this behavior,
by being combined with other propositions, perhaps about hidden masses,
or about the presence of forces other than inertia and gravitation.
</P>

<P>
Newtonian physics (in our sense) is evidently a scientific theory.
This fact, along with its unfalsifiability, is a refutation of Popper's
famous thesis that falsifiability is a necessary condition of a theory's
being a scientific one.  This criticism of Popper was made by Lakatos
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-4">4</A>].
</P>

<P>
Popper's reply is given in the following paragraph.  "Suppose that
our astronomical observations were to show, from tomorrow on, that the
velocity of the earth (which remains on its present geometrical path)
was increasing, either in its daily or in its annual movement, while the
other planets in the solar system proceeded as before.  Or suppose that
Mars started to move in a curve of the fourth power, instead of moving
in an ellipse of power 2.  Or assume still more simply, that we construct
a gun that fires ballistic missiles which consistently move in a clearly
non-Newtonian track [...].  There are an infinity of possibilities, and
the realization of any of them would simply refute Newton's theory.
In fact, almost any statement about a physical body which we may
make---say, about the cup of tea before me, that it begins to dance
(and say, in addition, without spilling the tea)---would contradict
Newtonian theory.  This theory would equally be contradicted if the
apples from one of my, or Newton's, apple trees were to rise up from
the ground (without there being a whirlwind about), and begin to dance
around the branches of the apple tree from which they had fallen, or if
the moon were to go off at a tangent; and if all of this were to happen,
perhaps, without any other very obvious changes in our environment"
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-5">5</A>].  (I have here substituted the word
"track" where, I take it, "tract" is a misprint in the original).
</P>

<P>
That Popper's reference to missiles which move in a "clearly non-Newtonian
track" was a flagrant begging of the question, I need hardly state.
The question, which Lakatos had answered in the negative, was, precisely,
whether there <EM>is</EM> any such thing as a "clearly", that is
<EM>observably</EM>, non-Newtonian track.
</P>

<P>
But the principal defect of the paragraph just quoted is much more
simple and amazing than this.  Consider the proposition: "There was
no whirlwind about; the apples which had fallen from my tree rose
from the ground and began to dance round the branches of the tree;
and this happened, perhaps, without any other very obvious change in
the environment".  It might be doubted, in view of the remarkable last
clause, whether this proposition is, as it needs to be in order to be
relevant at all, an <EM>observation</EM>-statement.  But we do not need
to decide that.  For it is not only obvious, it is blazingly obvious,
that <EM>this proposition</EM>, whether it is observational or not,
<EM>is not inconsistent with Newtonian physics</EM>.  The same is true,
and equally obviously true, of the proposition: "The cup of tea in front
of Popper began to dance, without spilling the tea".  The same is also
obviously true of every one of the other examples which Popper gives.
Yet he brazenly asserts that any of these propositions, and indeed
"<EM>almost any statement about a physical body</EM> which we may make
[...] <EM>would contradict</EM> Newtonian theory".
</P>

<P>
One can scarcely believe one's eyes while reading this paragraph of
Popper.  What beginning student of deductive logic would not be ashamed
to assert such transparent logical falsities as these?  (He would never be
tempted to do so, however, because they have not the smallest particle of
plausibility to recommend them).  What editor would print such palpable
untruths, if they came to him from an `ordinary philosopher'?  It is
difficult, in fact, to imagine a more brutal contempt for deductive
logic than is displayed by this impudent list of so-called falsifiers
of Newtonian physics.
</P>

<P>
If the paragraph quoted above was not mere bluff (as I believe it
was), then it testifies to the survival, in an unlikely quarter, of a
belief which was very common in the two preceding centuries, and which
has only recently been almost entirely extinguished: the belief that
Newtonian physics is a guarantee against the occurrence of---just about
anything disagreeable.  In the mid-18th century Dr.Johnson refused for
six months, on a mixture of Anglican and Newtonian grounds, to believe
the reports of the Lisbon earthquake.  In the mid-19th century it was
widely believed that Newtonian physics, as developed by Laplace in
particular, guaranteed the stability and permanence of the solar system
(at any rate until `the trumpet shall sound').  That this belief survived
to some extent even up to the mid-20th century, is strongly suggested by
the irrational hostility with which Immanuel Velikovsky's theories were
received in 1950.  Now, of course, when theories like his have become
respectable, this belief is almost extinct.  But even when it was at
its height, say among 18th-century Anglicans, I never heard of anyone
who believed that Newtonian physics was a logical guarantee of decent
behavior on the part of his <EM>teacup</EM>.
</P>

<P>
(3) My third example also concerns Newtonian physics, in the same sense
as before.  In this case the question is, what logical relation does
Newtonian physics bear to Kepler's laws of planetary motion?
</P>

<P>
An answer which has often been given to this question, and which has
been still more often implied, is that Newtonian physics <EM>entails</EM>
Kepler's laws.  It is obvious that this is not so.  Kepler's laws entail
that the planets and the sun exist; but Newtonian physics has no such
entailment.
</P>

<P>
Popper gives a different answer.  Newtonian physics, he says, is
actually inconsistent with Kepler's laws.  It "formally contradicts"
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-6">6</A>] them; "from a logical point of view,
Newton's theory, strictly speaking, contradicts both Galileo's and
Kepler's [...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-7">7</A>].
</P>

<P>
This answer to the above question has become an article of faith
among irrationalist philosophers of science.  Feyerabend [<A
HREF="notes.html#05-8">8</A>], Kuhn [<A HREF="notes.html#05-9">9</A>],
and many others [<A HREF="notes.html#05-10">10</A>] repeat it.  Yet it
is obvious that this answer too is false: <EM>strictly speaking</EM>,
and <EM>formally</EM>, Newtonian physics is <EM>not</EM> inconsistent
with Kepler's laws.
</P>

<P>
Kepler's laws are purely kinematic; that is, they simply ascribe certain
motions to certain bodies, and say nothing whatever about the mass
of anything, or about any force exerted by or on anything.  And it is
easily seen that no purely kinematic proposition is inconsistent with
Newtonian physics.  Take any purely kinematic proposition: for preference,
here, such a highly `non-Newtonian' one as, say, "The planets describe
rectangles with the sun as center".  This proposition is so far from
being inconsistent with Newtonian physics, that it could be <EM>deduced
from and explained by</EM> Newtonian physics, in conjunction with
certain contingent assumptions about the forces to which the planets
are subjected, the mass of the planets, their cohesiveness, and so on.
Some at least of these auxiliary propositions would of course be false
in fact.  Their conjunction with Newtonian physics would therefore
be false in fact too.  But that conjunction, obviously, need not be
<EM>logically</EM> false; as it would have to be, if the hypothesis of
rectangular orbits were actually inconsistent with Newtonian physics.
And the same is equally true of any other purely kinematic proposition,
such as Kepler's laws.

<P>
The examples which have just been given, of carelessness, or something
a good deal worse, regarding deductive-logical relations between
propositions, are characteristic of our authors.  They are in fact
characteristic of them in two senses.  One is, that other examples
of the same kind can easily be supplied from their writings [<A
HREF="notes.html#05-11">11</A>].  The other is, that there is no parallel
to these examples in the writings of non-irrationalist philosophers of
science.  In particular, one would look in vain in the writings of the
`inductive' logicians, for anything corresponding to the carelessness, in
matters of deductive-logical relations between propositions of science,
which has just been illustrated from our deductivist authors.
</P>

<P>
Now this is, at least at first sight, surprising.  One expects a
deductivist to be a severe judge of logical morals, and not only of
other people's: his own logical conduct one would expect to be above
reproach.  He is the last person one would expect to assert or imply that
a certain deductive-logical relation exists, in cases where it does not,
or does not exist, in cases where it does.  And on the other hand such
sloppiness would not be at all unexpected from `inductive' logicians.
After all, they are `soft on logic'.  For example they wish to palliate
those inductive propensities which erring man shares with the brute
creation, and which deductivists think should only be reprehended.
Indeed, the entire enterprise of `inductive' logic appears (at least to
its critics) intended to conceal, by a fig-leaf of system, the naked
indecency of affirming the consequent.  Why then is it precisely the
<EM>deductivists</EM>, and <EM>not</EM> the `inductive' logicians,
whose deductive logic turns out to be bad?  Why is it that, while
Popper's philosophy of science furnishes a steady stream of examples of
indifference to elementary deductive logic, the philosophy of Carnap or of
Hempel does nothing of the kind?  I believe I can answer this question.
</P>

<P>
Deductivism, it is to be remembered, is a variety of perfectionism:
it is an `only the best will do' thesis.  And, at least in very many
domains, perfectionism is especially apt to produce performance which
is actually further from perfection than the average for that domain.
In politics, for example, perfectionism is wisely recognized as having
brought into being the very worst societies.  In philosophy each of us
knows someone whose standards are so extremely high that he never does
any philosophy at all.  In morals the ancient perfectionist doctrine,
often revived, that all evils are <EM>equally</EM> evil, is at once
recognized by any person of common sense as sure to have disastrous
moral effects in practice.  And so on.
</P>

<P>
Nor is the inner mechanism of these causal connections at all hard to
perceive.  It is this.  The perfectionist, by his exclusive concentration
on the ideal, is prevented from attending to the <EM>differences</EM>
which exist among cases in which that ideal is not satisfied: even though
such cases may include <EM>all</EM> the actual ones (the ideal being so
high), and even though the differences are very great between some of
these cases and others.
</P>

<P>
This gives us a reason to anticipate that deductivists will be, in
practice, uncommonly careless in matters of deductive logic.  But it
does not on its own quite cover the particular case before us.  For here
the errors are all of one particular kind, and of a kind which is still
rather surprising.  Our authors' carelessness never takes the form of
implying that some specific deductive-logical relation does not exist, in
cases where it does.  In always takes the form, as in the three examples
given above, of implying that a specific deductive-logical relation
exists, in cases where it does not.  This cannot be explained just by the
tendency of perfectionism to result in <EM>general</EM> carelessness.
On the contrary, it is somewhat surprising in perfectionists.  For its
moral analogue (for example) would be, a perfectionist whose neglect of
the differences between actual evils often carried him to the point of
positively <EM>mistaking</EM> actual evils for ideal goods.  This is
not what one expects from perfectionists.  How is this particular
<EM>kind</EM> of carelessness to be explained?
</P>

<P>
Popper, as we saw in Chapter II above, rejected the belief that there
are propositions of science "the analysis of [whose] relations compels
us to introduce a special probabilistic logic which breaks the fetters
of classical logic" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-12">12</A>].  In opposition
to such views, he undertook to show that, even in the apparently
intractable cases, the logical relations between the propositions
of science can always be "fully analyzed in terms of the `classical'
logical relations of <EM>deducibility</EM> and <EM>contradiction</EM>"
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-13">13</A>].
</P>

<P>
Well, let us consider what the result of <EM>actually</EM> carrying
out this undertaking.  What is the <EM>actual</EM> `classical' logical
relation between, for example, one scientific theory and another, in those
cases in which they are intuitively and rightly called "competing" or
"rival" theories?  The relation cannot be contradiction or contrariety.
For as we have seen, two scientific theories (taking their logical
form to be what our authors say it is) cannot be inconsistent.
The relation cannot be sub-contrariety, since any two rival theories
might both be false.  There cannot be logical equivalence between them,
or over-entailment either way; for in any one of those cases it would be
quite wrong to call the two theories <EM>competing</EM>.  But these six
are the only deductive-logical relations possible between two contingent
propositions, apart from independence.  The logical relation, therefore,
between any two competing scientific theories, in independence.
</P>

<P>
What is the classical logical relation between, for example, Newtonian
physics and any observation-statement?  Not inconsistency, as we
have seen, Not sub-contrariety, since both could be false.  There is
no entailment either way.  So the answer to this question, too, is:
independence.
</P>

<P>
What is the classical logical relation between Newtonian physics and
Kepler's laws of planetary motion?  Not inconsistency, as we have
seen, Not sub-contrariety, since both could be false.  There is no
entailment either way.  So the `classical' answer to this question, too,
is independence.
</P>

<P>
What is the classical logical relation (to go back to a class of examples
which was, as we know, of peculiar importance to Popper) between H, "The
probability of a human birth being male is 0.9", and E, "The observed
relative frequency of males among births in human history so far is 0.51"?
Again the answer is, of course, independence.
</P>

<P>
Evidently, this is going to be an excessively uninteresting philosophy
of science!  Yet the four questions just asked are ones intensely
interesting to any philosopher of science, and are in fact typical
of the questions which interest him.  But if he insists on confining
his answers to classical or deductive-logical relations, then the only
answer which he can give with truth to any of them is the uninteresting
one, "independence".  This answer is uninteresting, because almost
<EM>any</EM> two propositions are logically independent: for example,
almost any two <EM>non</EM>-competing scientific theories (the Copernican
theory and Darwinism, say), as well as any two competing theories, are
independent.  And the ultimate reason for <EM>that</EM>, of course,
is that the classical logical relation of independence is extremely
<EM>unspecific</EM>: it comprehends indifferently logical relations
which are in fact of the utmost diversity.  Hence by giving just the same
answer in all of the four examples above, obvious and important logical
differences among those cases are suppressed: the fact, for example, that
while in the last case given above, E <EM>disconfirms</EM> H, Kepler's
laws do not disconfirm Newtonian physics.
</P>

<P>
Confronted, then, with almost any interesting question about the logical
relations between propositions of science, a philosopher who is resolved
to confine his possible answers to deductive-logical relations, is
faced with an extremely painful choice.  He absolutely must: either
give no answer at all; or give an answer which is true but excessively
uninteresting both to himself and others; or give an answer which may
be interesting but is false.
</P>

<P>
Now our authors, as I have said, always in fact choose the third kind of
these alternatives.  This is explicable, but on only one hypothesis,
to the nature of which the first two alternatives just mentioned
provide the clue.  For the three alternatives may be reduced to just
the following two: a deductivist philosopher must either give a false
answer, or <EM>suffer painful under-exercise of his logical faculty</EM>.
Our authors' characteristic kind of carelessness, of attributing to a
pair of propositions a deductive-logical relation which they simply do
not possess, is therefore a case of <EM>vacuum-activity</EM> in Lorenz's
sense [<A HREF="notes.html#05-14">14</A>].
</P>

<P>
The commonest case of vacuum-activity is that in which a dog,
long deprived of both bones and of soil, `buries' a non-existent
bone in non-existent soil (usually in the corner of a room).  This
behavior-pattern is innate in dogs, and if deprived for too long of
its proper objects, it simply `discharges' itself in the absence of
those objects.  After a certain point, bone-free life is just too boring
for dogs.
</P>

<P>
Just so, our authors are philosophers of science, and have a built-in
need to answer interesting questions about the logical relations
between propositions of science.  But what can be said with truth in
answer to such questions, <EM>without `breaking the fetters of classical
logic'</EM>, is painfully uninteresting; while our authors are resolved
to permit themselves no other kind of answer.  After a certain point,
however, life without interesting logical relations is just too boring
for philosophers.  Sooner or later, then, <EM>another</EM> and more
interesting deductive-logical answer discharges itself, although in
entire disregard to the absence of its proper objects.  Then, for example,
Kepler's laws and Newtonian physics are called "inconsistent"; although
anyone who is not under the same compulsion as the deductivist easily sees
at once that those two propositions are in fact merely independent.
</P>

<P>
This phenomenon can equally well be looked at, of course, from the
other end.  The dog engaged in his vacuum-activity, if he could
write, might say, exactly in the style of Lakatos, "I am `burying' a
`bone'".  If he were more Popperian he might write either "I introduce
a methodological rule permitting us to regard this as bone-burying",
or "Any similarly-deprived dog would regard this as burying a bone".
His ghost-behavior corresponds to their ghost-logical statements.
</P>

<P>
The apparent paradox, of deductivists whose deductive logic is sloppy, and
`inductive' logicians whose deductive logic is not, is thus resolved.
Our authors, by their determination to acknowledge no other than
deductive-logical relations, are self-condemned, when they come to almost
any interesting question about the relation between propositions of
science, to being totally silent, totally uninteresting, or totally wrong.
Faced with the first two dread alternatives, a philosopher's reaction
will not be long in doubt.  The `inductive' logician, on the other hand,
is from the start under no such compulsion.  That is why he can write
about the relations between propositions of science, without having to
produce a stream of elementary mistakes in deductive logic.
</P>

<P>
There is another feature of our authors' writings, a feature even more
pronounced and characteristic of them than their carelessness about
deductive logic, the explanation of which also lies in their deductivism.
This is, their levity or <EM>enfant-terriblisme</EM>.
</P>

<P>
The levity of Feyerabend is too `gross, open, and palpable', to
require that instances be given here to prove it.  In <EM>Against
Method</EM> it is in fact so omnipresent that he has managed to
entangle himself in a certain `paradox of levity' which is, as far as
I know, entirely original.  Feyerabend enjoins the reader of that book
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-15">15</A>], indeed he pleads with him [<A
HREF="notes.html#05-16">16</A>], not to take anything he reads there
too seriously.  But this injunction and this plea are among the things he
reads there.  How seriously, then, ought the reader to take <EM>them</EM>?
</P>

<P>
Lakatos' fame as a philosopher of science rests principally on his
[1970].  He there claimed, among other things, to give an account, more
accurate than anyone else had given, of the actual <EM>history</EM>
of science.  Yet that essay contains several episodes from the history
of science, episodes complete with circumstantial detail, which are,
Lakatos calmly tells us in footnotes [<A HREF="notes.html#05-17">17</A>],
fabrications of his own.  Perhaps it will be said that this instance is
not characteristic: a mere isolated outcrop of levity.  Even if it were
so, this particular way of wasting paper is not one which would even
suggest itself to a philosopher who was in earnest with his subject.
But in any case there are in Lakatos many instances of levity which are
indisputably characteristic.  One is the long footnote in <EM>Proofs
and Refutations</EM> about proof in mathematics.  This begins with the
remarkable understatement, that "Many working mathematicians are puzzled
about what proofs are for if they do not prove".  And Lakatos goes on to
quote, with relish, the mathematician G.H.Hardy, as follows: "`proofs are
what [...] I call <EM>gas</EM>, rhetorical flourishes designed to affect
psychology, pictures on the board in the lecture, devices to stimulate the
imagination of pupils'" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-18">18</A>].  As academic
humor, this may be allowed to pass (combining as it does self-contempt,
and the contempt of others, in the prescribed unequal proportions); as
serious philosophy of mathematics, not.
</P>

<P>
Most people suppose that Popper is far removed, at least in this matter of
levity or <EM>enfant-terriblisme</EM>, from those intellectual progeny of
his to whom I have just referred.  Indeed, there are at the present time
many youngish philosophers of science in whose writings Popper is made
to serve (since they know next to nothing of any philosopher of science
before him) as their standing and cautionary example of the unbearable
<EM>gravitas</EM> which characterized philosophers of science in the dark
ages.  But this is merely a measure of the ignorance of such persons; the
truth is exactly the opposite.  <EM>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</EM>
was no less an <EM>enfant-terriblisme</EM> first book than <EM>Language,
Truth and Logic</EM>, or <EM>A Treatise of Human Nature</EM>.
</P>

<P>
The simple and sufficient proof of Popper's levity is this: that he is
always saying `daring' things that he does not mean.  For example he says,
and says, as we have seen, with all possible emphasis, that there is no
good reason to believe any scientific theory.  But he is not in earnest.
He does not really believe that there is no good reason to believe
that his blood circulates, or that the earth rotates and revolves,
or that his desk is an assemblage of molecules---or a thousand other
scientific theories which could as easily be mentioned.  Confront him
with members of the Stationary Blood Society, who <EM>are</EM> in
earnest when they say that there is no good reason to believe that the
blood circulates, and Popper would find the difference manifest enough
between real irrationalism, and his own `parlor-pink' version of it.
Indeed, even as things are, Popper every now and then notices, to his
alarm, that what Hume called `the rabble without doors' shows some
tendency to <EM>agree</EM> with him, that there is no good reason to
believe any scientific theory: at these points, the reader of Popper
is about to receive another lay-sermon on the deplorable growth of
irrationalism, relativism, etc.  In other words, Popper's daring
irrationalist sallies are meant to be tried, like a baron under Magna
Carta, only by a jury of his peers, and for the same reason: the other
people might not <EM>understand</EM>.
</P>

<P>
The levity of Popper and his followers concerning science bears a
marked analogy, therefore, to a species of <EM>political</EM> levity
which is excessively familiar: what Kipling called "making mock of
uniforms that guard you while you sleep".  For who are the pet aversion
of Popperites, as policemen are of parlor-pinks?  Why, ordinary
flesh-and-blood scientists, of course!  Any contact with living
scientists always leaves a Popperite far more Feyerabendian than it
found him.  It can be relied on to bring him out in fury of what we may
call `criticismism'.  Scientists, he finds to his horror, are dogmatic,
uncritical, authoritarian, etc., etc.  So they are, of course.  They are
also people of the very same kind, by and large, as those who have erected
what Popper himself once called, in a moment of self-forgetfulness,
"the soaring edifice of science" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-19">19</A>].
</P>

<P>
It is the frivolous elevation of the `critical attitude' into a
categorical imperative of intellectual life, which has been at once
the most influential and the most mischievous aspect of Popper's
philosophy of science.  That it is frivolous, should be evident from
the tautology that it is only valuable criticism which is of value;
not criticism as such.  The demand that scientists <EM>in general</EM>
should be critics and innovators, rather than mere followers, is even,
in its extreme forms, self-contradictory; like the implicit demand of
those educationalists who want every child to be <EM>exceptionally</EM>
creative.  (Before they complain of the rarity of any great critical
faculty in scientists, Popperites should read Hume on what he called
those "thoughtless people" who complain of the rarity of great beauty
in women [<A HREF="notes.html#05-20">20</A>]).  Even in its non-extreme
forms, however, the apotheosis of the critical attitude has had, as
its principal effect, simply this: to fortify millions of ignorant
graduates and undergraduates in the belief, to which they are already
only too firmly wedded by other causes, that the adversary posture is
all, and that intellectual life consists in "directionless quibble"
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-21">21</A>].
</P>

<HR>

<P>
In the most marked contrast possible to all of this, the writings of the
`inductive' logicians are entirely free of levity.  These philosophers
take science not as furnishing materials for mere `critical discussion',
but seriously.  They have nothing of our authors' bohemian contempt
for, or disbelief in, success.  On the contrary, scientific success
is treated by them as the obvious though wonderful fact which it is.
They never say daring things that they do not mean about science.
</P>

<P>
The levity of our authors, and the absence of levity in the
`inductive' logicians, is sufficiently obvious as a fact.  But why
do I say that the explanation of it lies in the fact that our authors
are deductivists, while the `inductive' logicians are not?  The main
part of my answer is this: that deductivism, the thesis from which all
the disagreements between these two groups of philosophers spring,
is a proposition which can recommend itself <EM>only</EM> to the
minds of <EM>enfant-terribles</EM> or other extreme doctrinaires, and
more specifically, that deductivism is a thesis of an intrinsically
<EM>frivolous</EM> kind.
</P>

<P>
Consider the argument to the conclusion "I will win a lottery tomorrow",
from: "There is a fair lottery of 1000 tickets, to be drawn tomorrow, in
which I hold just one ticket or none".  Here everyone would agree that
the premise is no reason to believe the conclusion.  Anyone who said the
same thing, however, about the argument to the same conclusion from the
above premise minus its last two words, would find few to agree with him.
On the contrary, the difference in logical value between the two arguments
is so manifest, that such a person would be thought to display an almost
unheard-of degree of logical blindness or perversity.  But let us change
the premise again, so that it now ends with "[...] in which I hold just
999 tickets".  Anyone who said that, even here, the premise is no reason
to believe the conclusion, would evidently thereby announce himself as
one of those hopeless doctrinaires with whom rational argument, and even
`critical discussion', is effort thrown away.
</P>

<P>
The deductivist, however, <EM>must</EM> say that in all three of
these arguments the premise is no reason to believe the conclusion.
For all three are invalid, and incurably so.  This is enough to show
that deductivism is one of those theses which, although anyone under
pressure of philosophical argument might momentarily reconcile himself
to it, would not be adhered to willingly and with knowledge of its
consequences, by anyone except an <EM>enfant-terriblisme</EM> or an
extreme doctrinaire.
</P>

<P>
Suppose I have come to know that P, "I hold just 999 of 1000 tickets in
a fair lottery to be drawn tomorrow"; and suppose that, as a result
of acquiring this knowledge, I have come to have a higher degree
of belief than I had before in the proposition Q: "I will win the
lottery tomorrow".  Suppose that I am then reminded by someone of the
fact that R, "It is logically possible that P be true and Q false"; and
suppose I fully accept this truth, and add it to my stock of knowledge.
I acknowledge, in other words, that although I hold nearly all tickets in
this fair lottery, I might not win it.  Suppose, finally, that on account
of adding this truth R to my premise P, I come to have a <EM>lower</EM>
degree of belief in Q than I had before being reminded of R.
</P>

<P>
In that case, it will be evident, I am being irrational, and more
specifically I am being frivolous.  Irrational, because R is
a <EM>necessary</EM> truth, and hence its conjunction with P is
logically equivalent to P itself, while two arguments cannot differ
in logical value if their premises are logically equivalent and they
have the same conclusion.  And my irrationality is of a frivolous kind.
My conclusion Q is a contingent proposition, saying only that the actual
world is thus-and-so.  My additional premise R is a proposition true in
all possible worlds.  But a proposition true in all possible worlds cannot
tell in the slightest degree for or against any proposition just about
the actual world.  (If it could, why ever leave the armchair at all?
Why not do <EM>all</EM> our science <EM>a priori</EM>?).  Yet after
having allowed my degree of belief in the contingent Q to be raised
by the contingent P, I have allowed it to be depressed again by the
addition to P of a premise R which, where the conclusion of this argument
is contingent, as it is here, <EM>cannot weigh anything at all</EM>.
To do this is <EM>light-mindedness</EM> on my part; and it would be
light-mindedness in anyone else to demand it of me.
</P>

<P>
Let us change the example to one in which the argument is inductive.
P is now "All the many flames observed in the past have been hot", and
Q is "Any flames observed tomorrow will be hot".  Suppose that I have
come to know P, and that, as a result of acquiring this knowledge, I have
come to a higher degree of belief in Q than I had before.  Suppose I am
then reminded by someone of the fact that R, "It is logically possible,
however many may be the `many flames' referred to in P, that P be true
and Q false".  And suppose that I fully accept this truth, and add it
to my stock of knowledge.
</P>

<P>
Now, if on account of adding this truth R to my premise P, I come to
have a lower degree of belief in Q than I had before, then I am being
irrational in exactly the same frivolous way as in the case of the
lottery.  For here too the additional premise R is a necessary truth,
while the conclusion of the argument Q is contingent.  Therefore R cannot
tell in the slightest degree against or for Q.  Yet having allowed my
degree of belief in the contingent Q to be raised by the contingent P, I
have allowed it to be depressed again by the addition to P of a premise
R, which cannot weigh anything at all in an argument about whether flames
will be hot tomorrow.
</P>

<P>
Yet it is <EM>precisely</EM> this piece of light-mindedness that the
deductivist demands of me.  The deductivist, Hume for example, tells me
that P is no reason to believe Q; and of course, if that <EM>is</EM>
so, then I should indeed lower my degree of belief in Q.  But I ask
him, <EM>why</EM> is P no reason to believe Q, or <EM>why</EM> should
I lower my degree of belief in Q?  Is Hume about to remind me of some
quite other contingent fact S, which I have neglected, and which tells
<EM>against</EM> Q, perhaps even making it probable that some flames
tomorrow will <EM>not</EM> be hot?  Hardly!  So I repeat my question:
why should I lower my degree of belief in Q?  Forsooth, Hume tells
me, just for this reason: that a man who infers Q from P, or from
P conjoined with any other observation-statement "is not guilty of
a tautology" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-22">22</A>]; that given P, and
any other observational premise, "the consequence [Q] is <EM>nowise
necessary</EM>" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-23">23</A>]; that, whatever our
experience has been, "a change in the course of nature [...] is <EM>not
absolutely impossible</EM>" [<A HREF="notes.html#05-24">24</A>]; that
past and future hot flames are `distinct existences', that is, that the
one <EM>might</EM> exist without the other; and so on.
</P>

<P>
This, and nothing else in the world, is what Hume finds to object to in my
inductive inference from P to Q.  This is the whole of his answer to the
question, why I should lower my degree of belief in Q.  Yet it amounts
just to this, that the inference from P to Q is invalid, and remains so
under all observational additions to its premises; or in other words just
to R, that it is possible for P, and any other observation-statement to
be true, and Q false.  But this is a necessary truth.  And therefore to
demand, just on <EM>this</EM> account, that I should lower my degree of
belief in the hotness of tomorrow's flames, is mere frivolity.
</P>

<P>
Of course exactly the same is true of Popper.  If I have, as Popper
says I should not have, a positive degree of belief in some scientific
theory, what can Popper urge against me?  Why, nothing at all, in the end,
except this: that despite all the actual or possible empirical evidence
in its favor, the theory <EM>might</EM> be false.  But this is nothing
but a harmless necessary truth; and to make <EM>it</EM> as a reason
for not believing scientific theories is simply a frivolous species of
irrationality.  Yet it is this proposition, that any scientific theory,
despite all the possible evidence for it, <EM>might</EM> be false: a
proposition loudly announced by the fall of Newtonian physics; amplified
ever since by morbidly sensitive philosophic ears; endlessly reapplied
and reworded; insisted on to the exclusion of every other logical truth
about science, and mistaken for a reason for not believing scientific
theories; it is this proposition, so treated, which may be said to
<EM>be</EM> irrationalist philosophy of science.
</P>

<P>
This phenomenon is so far from being new, that it appears to be
a perennial feature of sceptical or irrationalist philosophy.
To furnish a reason for doubting all contingent propositions among
others, Descartes appears to have thought it sufficient if he could
establish the <EM>logical possibility</EM> of an all-deceiving demon
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-25">25</A>].  The sceptics of later classical
antiquity were fully conscious of the dependence of their entire
philosophy on expressions such as "might" and "possibly", and they
appear to be constantly guilty of taking logical truths involving
such expressions as grounds for doubting contingent propositions
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-26">26</A>].  And among recent irrationalist
philosophers of science, along with neutralized success-words and
sabotaged logical-expressions, an unfailing literary diagnostic is, the
use of the frivolous or deductivist "might".  Such philosophers can be
absolutely relied on to try to cast doubt on the truth of contingent
propositions, by the enunciation of mere logical truths about the
<EM>possibility</EM> of their falsity.
</P>

<P>
In Hume's <EM>Treatise, Abstract</EM>, and first <EM>Enquiry</EM>,
deductivism, conjoined with the incurable infallibility of induction, led
to scepticism about induction.  The latter two books, were, of course,
rewritings of Book I of the <EM>Treatise</EM>: "a juvenile work", as
Hume tells us, "which the Author had projected before he left College"
[<A HREF="notes.html#05-27">27</A>].  It is therefore not surprising
that in the central argument of those books, concerning induction, the
key premise should have been the <EM>enfant-terrible</EM> thesis of
deductivism.  But Hume, unlike our authors, did not remain a deductivist
<EM>enfant-terrible</EM> all his life.  In the one philosophical work of
his maturity, which is also his best, the <EM>Dialogues concerning Natural
Religion</EM>, the incurable invalidity of induction is maintained
as firmly as ever.  But at the same time, in that book, inductive
<EM>scepticism</EM>, and therefore by implication deductivism, are
rejected very early, and with a summariness which is well-proportioned
to their frivolity [<A HREF="notes.html#05-28">28</A>].
</P>

Hume did better than that, however.  Late in his life he made precisely
the contemptuous dismissal that any rational inductive fallibilist
must make of inductive scepticism, and by implication of deductivism.
This was on his deathbed, in a conversation with Boswell on the
subject of immortality.  Boswell, almost desperate for some hint of
consolation, "asked him if it was not possible that there might be
a future state.  He answered, It was <EM>possible</EM> that a piece
of coal put on the fire would not burn; and he added that it was a
<EM>most unreasonable fancy</EM> that he should exist for ever" [<A
HREF="notes.html#05-29">29</A>].  I earnestly commend this remark,
of their founding father and favorite deductivist, to irrationalist
philosophers of science.  For it, and not the deductivist levity of
the <EM>Treatise</EM> or of their own writings, expresses exactly the
response of a rational man to contingencies which are recommended to
his belief just on the impertinent ground of their possibility.
</P>

<P>
Of course I do not say that every philosopher who is a deductivist is
frivolous.  I do say that deductivism is intrinsically a thesis of a
deeply frivolous nature; that it is the premise from which flow all the
irrationalist consequences of our authors' philosophy of science; and
that the levity which their philosophy exhibits so markedly is therefore
to be explained, as their irrationalism is, by the influence on their
minds of deductivism.  But it is no more to be inferred from the fact
that deductivism is frivolous, that all deductivists are frivolous,
than it is to be inferred from the fact that patience is a virtue, that
all the patient are virtuous.  And in the one case or in the other, the
conclusion would be false in fact; for even among our four authors there
is one who, in this respect, stands apart from the others.
</P>

<P>
Kuhn shares with our other authors, as he must, their boundless contempt
for `inductive' logic.  His remark about "cloud-cuckoo land", for
example, quoted in Chapter II above (see the text to footnote 30), is
a thinly-veiled contemptuous reference to it.  But setting this point
aside, his writings are entirely free from the levity which disfigures the
writings of our other authors.  His philosophy of science is not daring;
only shocking.  He had no time at all for criticismism, and to <EM>epater
les bourgeois</EM> is the least of his concerns.  His admiration for
`normal science' is so pronounced that it brings out Popper and his
followers in a perfect rash of Spocks [<A HREF="notes.html#05-30">30</A>].
</P>

<P>
The reason is, that Kuhn is in earnest with irrationalist philosophy of
science, while the others are not.  He actually believes, what the others
only imply and pretend to believe, that there has been no accumulation of
knowledge in the last four centuries [<A HREF="notes.html#05-31">31</A>].
And he even bids fair, by the immense influence of his writings on
`the rabble without doors', to make irrationalism the <EM>majority</EM>
opinion.  `This was the most unkindest cut of all' for our other authors,
and is in fact the real ground of the offense which Kuhn has undoubtedly
given them; as distinct from the avowed but manifestly spurious ground
mentioned at the beginning of the book.  For the cruellest fate which
can overtake <EM>enfants-terribles</EM> is to awake and find that their
avowed opinions have swept the suburbs.

There are, unfortunately, grounds for believing that the deductivist cast
of mind is, like priesthood, indelible; or at least that deductivism,
and the levity which is its natural consequence, can never be entirely
erased from any mind in which they have once taken hold.

Consider again the fair lottery to be drawn tomorrow, in which I hold
just 999 of the 1000 tickets.  Imagine this case to be described by
a contemporary philosopher: one who was formerly a deductivist, but
who has since `put away the toy-trumpet of sedition' in philosophy.
This philosopher, in other words, has arrived at the prodigious pitch of
learning which enables him to say, and to believe, what non-philosophers
believed all along: that, in this case, while it is possible that I will
not win a lottery tomorrow, it is probable that I will.
</P>

<P>
Now, will there not be, even so, a faint apologetic smile accompanying
the word "probable", but not the word "possible", if our ex-deductivist is
speaking?  If he is writing, will there not be sabotaging quotation-marks
around "probable", though not around "possible"?  Almost to a certainty
there will.  A contemporary philosopher can hardly rid himself, even if
his life depended on it, of the feeling that the possibility of my not
winning the lottery is `objective', in some sense in which the probability
of my winning it is not.
</P>

<P>
It is essentially the same in the inductive case.  The contemporary
philosopher will admit easily enough, once it is pointed out to him, that
it is a mere <EM>logical</EM> truth that tomorrow's flames <EM>may</EM>
be unlike past ones; and that therefore this <EM>cannot</EM> be a
reason to <EM>doubt</EM> that they will be like them.  Yet in spite of
all his efforts to prevent it doing so, this logical truth operates on
his mind as though it <EM>were</EM> such a reason, and a weighty one.
So obsessive is our endless re-enactment of the death of Newtonian
physics, and so permanently disabling is `modern nervousness' in the
philosophy of science.
</P>

<P>
That this state of mind is a confused one, it can hardly be necessary
to say.  Probabilities are no less objective than possibilities.  On any
philosophy of probability, alternatives which are equally probable can be
called, with equal propriety, equally possible; and for one alternative
to be more probable than another, it is logically sufficient that
there be, for every way in which the second can be realized, an equally
possible way in which the first can be realized, but not conversely.
Anyone, therefore, who is hyper-sensitive to possibilities, but at
the same time is insensitive to all difference in magnitudes between
probabilities, is certainly in a deeply-confused mental state; even,
one would think, a pathological state.  Yet this is, in some degree,
the actual mental state of most philosophers of science at the present
time, and is to a pre-eminent degree the mental state of deductivist
philosophers of science, such as our authors.
</P>

<P>
If it is true that any philosopher who was once a deductivist will
carry at least some tincture of deductivism to his grave, then the
prospects are so much the worse for there being any future philosophy of
science which is free from the levity and other vices of irrationalism.
For there can scarcely be any contemporary philosopher of science who
is not either a deductivist or an ex-deductivist.
