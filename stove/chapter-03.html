<P>
Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos and Feyerabend have succeeded in making
irrationalist philosophy of science acceptable to many readers who would
reject it out of hand if it were presented to them without equivocation
and consistently.  It was thus that the question arose to which the first
Part of this book was addressed: namely, how did they achieve this?
My answer was, that they did so principally by means of two literary
devices discussed in Part One.  The question to which the present Part
of this book is addressed is: how was irrationalist philosophy of science
made acceptable <EM>to these authors themselves?</EM>
</P>

<P>
Some part of the answer to this question no doubt lies in those very
misuses of language which have already been discussed.  For there is no
reason to suppose that our authors' characteristic treatment of logical
expressions and success-words has imposed on the writers any less than
on their readers.  But obviously, there must be some much more basic
answer than this to the historical question which I have just raised.
How did irrationalism about science come to recommend itself <EM>at all
and in the first place</EM>, to some leading philosophers from about 1920
onwards, as it did not, and could not have done, to their counterparts a
hundred or two hundred years earlier?  It must be in principle possible to
explain this phenomenon, just as it is possible in principle to explain
any other large-scale movement in the history of thought.
</P>

<P>
It is not to be assumed, of course, that the origins of recent
irrationalist philosophy of science are <EM>purely</EM> intellectual:
that this philosophy came into being solely as a result of our
authors accepting some thesis or other, and duly accepting its logical
consequences.  The common-sense assumption is in fact the other way.
Any large-scale movement of thought is likely to be brought about,
at least in part, by non-intellectual causes; and the present case is
presumably no exception.
</P>

<P>
Nevertheless it will be taken for granted here that the origins of
the movement of thought with which we are concerned are at any rate
<EM>principally</EM> intellectual: that is, that the irrationalist
conclusions of our authors' philosophy <EM>are</EM> embraced by them
principally because they are logical consequences of some premises
which these authors accept.  Not to take this for granted would amount
to intolerable condescension towards the authors in question, similar
in kind to that by which Marxist writers `explain' Darwin as though he
were some some simple mechanical toy.
</P>

<P>
The question is, then, what are the intellectual origins of
recent irrationalism in the philosophy of science?  Since we are
looking for <EM>intellectual</EM> origins, the answer must consist
in some <EM>thesis</EM> or other.  And since were are looking for
<EM>origins</EM>, the thesis must be one which functions in our authors'
philosophy as a <EM>premise</EM>, and not as a consequence of other
theses.  Further still: what we seek to identify is that one among their
premises which is <EM>the key premise</EM> of their irrationalism, in
the sense that without it their philosophy of science would not have
(that is, the other premises of it do not have) any irrationalist
consequences at all.
</P>

<P>
Our question, then, is purely historical.  The answer to it, however,
is not of historical interest only.  It would indeed be extremely
interesting, as a matter of the history of thought, to know what is
the key premise, in the sense just explained, of recent irrationalist
philosophy of science.  But the <EM>philosophical</EM> interest which
indirectly attaches to our enquiry is greater still.  What philosophers
will want most to know, concerning the key premise of our authors'
philosophy, is whether or not it is <EM>true</EM>.  But in order for
that to be known, it is an obviously indispensable preliminary, that it
be known what this proposition <EM>is</EM>.
</P>

<P>
In this book only the preliminary and historical task, of identifying
this proposition, is attempted; not the philosophical task of determining
its truth-value.  But if we can do even this much, then there will be
some immediate and substantial benefit to philosophers.  Controversies
constantly take place between our authors (or their followers) and
other philosophers who, while they share <EM>some</EM> of our authors'
premises, disagree with their irrationalist conclusions.  If our authors'
key premise were once identified, then it would be known, to both sides
in such controversies, where their disagreements begin.  How valuable
such information is, in enabling pointless discussion to be avoided,
and yet how hard to come by in philosophy, no philosopher need be told.
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><BIG>2</BIG></DIV>

<P>
Since most of the quotations in Part One illustrated ways in which
our authors' irrationalism is <EM>disguised</EM>, we should here
satisfy ourselves that the phenomenon which we wish to explain really
does exist: that is, that our authors' philosophy of science really is
irrationalist.  The best way to do this with reasonable brevity is to put
before the reader (who is assumed to be familiar with their writings)
a few concrete and pungent reminders of those writings: to cite some
things our authors say about science, which, while they are indisputably
representative of their philosophy, are at the same time extremely and
overtly irrationalist.  This is what is done in the present section.
</P>

<P>
First, then: if there has been a great increase in knowledge in
recent centuries, then <EM>a fortiriori</EM> there sometimes are
such things as positive good reasons to believe a scientific theory;
but Popper says expressly, repeatedly, and emphatically, that there
are not and cannot be such things.  This thesis is so startlingly
irrationalist that other philosophers, as Popper himself tells us,
sometimes "cannot quite bring [themselves] to believe that this is
my opinion".  But it is: "There <EM>are</EM> no such things as good
positive reasons" [<A HREF="notes.html#03-1">1</A>] to believe any
scientific theory.  "Positive reasons are neither necessary not possible"
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-2">2</A>].
</P>

<P>
These opinions will be admitted to be irrationalist enough: and they
are too deliberately and emphatically expressed to be unrepresentative.
</P>

<P>
A scientific theory, Popper never tires of reminding his readers, is
never certain in relation to, or in other words deducible from, those
propositions that constitute (in most people's eyes) the reasons to
believe it.  Of course I do not cite <EM>this</EM> as an irrationalist
thesis.  It is only a <EM>fallibilist</EM> one: it asserts no more than
the <EM>logical possibility</EM> of the conjunction of the evidence
for any given scientific theory, with the negation of that theory.
This thesis is so far from being one which is peculiar to the authors
with whom we are concerned, that it is nowadays a commonplace with almost
all philosophers of science.  But Popper goes much further than this.
It is a favorite thesis with him that a scientific theory is, not only
never certain, but never even <EM>probable</EM>, in relation to the
evidence for it [<A HREF="notes.html#03-3">3</A>].  More than that: a
scientific theory, he constantly says, cannot even be <EM>more</EM>
probable, in relation to the empirical evidence for it, than it is
<EM>a priori</EM>, or in the absence of all empirical evidence [<A
HREF="notes.html#03-4">4</A>].
</P>

<P>
These two theses will be acknowledged to be irrationalist enough; and
they are ones upon which Popper repeatedly insists.  He goes much further
still, however.  The truth of any scientific theory or law-statement, he
constantly says, is exactly as improbable, both <EM>a priori</EM> and in
relation to any possible evidence, as the truth of a self-contradictory
proposition [<A HREF="notes.html#03-5">5</A>]; or, to put the matter in
plain English (as Popper does not), it is impossible.
</P>

<P>
Again: scientific knowledge is usually thought to have at least
some connection with rational belief, but Popper writes: "Belief, of
course, is never rational: it is rational to <EM>suspend</EM> belief"
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-6">6</A>].  One hardly knows what to wonder
at more here, the thesis itself, or the arrogance of the author's "of
course".  His thesis, as will be evident, goes far beyond the philosophy
of <EM>science</EM>.  But it certainly does go as far as that, and will
be admitted to express, in that domain, an irrationalism sufficiently
uncompromising.
</P>

<P>
Again: Popper endorses the notorious sceptical thesis of Hume concerning
inductive arguments, or arguments from the observed to the unobserved.
This is the thesis that no proposition about the observed is a reason
to believe any contingent proposition about the unobserved; or in other
words, that the premise of an inductive argument is never a reason
to believe its conclusion.  Popper constantly and emphatically, and
with detailed references to Hume, expresses his assent to this thesis.
He writes, for example: "I agree with Hume's opinion that induction is
invalid and in no sense justified" [<A HREF="notes.html#03-7">7</A>].
And again: "<EM>Are we rationally justified in reasoning from repeated
instances of which we have experience to instances of which we have
had no experience?</EM>  Hume's unrelenting answer is: No, we are not
justified [...] My own view is that Hume's answer to this problem is right
[...]" [<A HREF="notes.html#03-8">8</A>].  There are many other statements
by Popper to exactly the same effect [<A HREF="notes.html#03-9">9</A>].
</P>

<P>
Scepticism about induction is an irrationalist thesis itself, but its
irrationalist character is enormously amplified if it is combined, as
it is in Hume and in Popper, with the thesis of empiricism: that is,
with the thesis that no propositions <EM>other than</EM> propositions
about the observed can be a reason to believe a contingent proposition
about the unobserved.  For then it follows at once (since inductive
scepticism says that there can be no reason from experience), that there
can be no reason <EM>at all</EM>, to believe any contingent propositions
about the unobserved: which class of propositions includes, of course,
all scientific theories.  Hume, being an empiricist, did draw from
his inductive scepticism this even more irrationalist conclusion:
`scepticism about the unobserved', as we may call it.  And Popper, for
the same reason, does the same.
</P>

<P>
Hume's inductive scepticism, while it is an irrationalist thesis among
others in Popper's philosophy of science, is also more than that:
it is one on which all the others logically depend.  Whenever Popper
undertakes, as he often does, to explain the grounds of his philosophy
of science, and especially of whatever is most irrationalist in it, the
reader is sure to meet with yet another of Popper's expositions, with
detailed reference to Hume's writings and with unqualified endorsement
of Hume's scepticism about induction [<A HREF="notes.html#03-10">10</A>].
If we take any other representative expression of Popper's irrationalism
(for example, those mentioned above in the second to the sixth paragraph
of this section), and ask ourselves "Why does Popper believe this?",
then part at least of the answer is always the same, and always obvious.
It is because he shares Hume's scepticism about induction.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
It would be easy to extend indefinitely a list of irrationalist theses
which are representative of our authors; but there is no need to do
so here.  The examples given above suffice for the present purpose,
which was only to satisfy ourselves that the philosophy of science here
in question really is irrationalist.  It is a sufficient condition for a
philosophy of science to be irrationalist (as we said at the beginning
of this book) if consistency with it requires reluctance to admit
that there has been a great increase of knowledge in recent centuries.
Popper's philosophy of science, it will be evident even from the few
samples of it given above, fulfills this condition amply.
</P>

<P>
The examples of irrationalist theses given above were not only few
in number, but were all drawn from Popper, none of them from any of
our other three authors.  But this too is perfectly proper, and in
fact appropriate.  Popper's philosophy of science is at any rate not
<EM>more</EM> irrationalist than that of Feyerabend, Kuhn, or Lakatos, and
at the same time, as a matter of well-known history, Popper's philosophy
owes nothing to theirs, while Kuhn's philosophy owes much, and the
philosophy of Lakatos and Feyerabend owes nearly everything, to Popper.
</P>

<HR>

<DIV ALIGN="center"><BIG>3</BIG></DIV>

<P>
Our object, then, is to identify the key premise (in the sense explained
earlier) of the reasoning by which our authors have been led to such
irrationalist conclusions about science as have been cited in the
preceding section.
</P>

<P>
There is no reason to expect this identification to be very easily made.
It is always harder to identify a person's premises than to identify
his conclusions.  The reason is obvious.  A reasoner's premises or
starting-points are those propositions which he feels most entitled
to take for granted.  They are, therefore, the parts of his reasoning
which are least likely to be explicit enough to enable other people
to identify them easily.  Indeed, it is sometimes difficult or even
impossible for the reasoner <EM>himself</EM> to identify all his premises.
For a proposition can be a premise of a person's reasoning without his
ever having put it into words, and even without his being conscious of
believing it at all.
</P>

<P>
It is nowhere of more importance than in philosophy to make clear what
our reasoning is, and hence what our premises are; and most philosophers
accordingly, at least aim to achieve these things.  But, whether from
differences in temperament or in training, their actual achievements
in this respect are very unequal, and many philosophers simply are not
clear enough reasoners to enable their premises to be identified with
any confidence.  Again, it will be difficult to identify a philosopher's
premises, however clear a reasoner he may be, in proportion as his
philosophy is derivative from some one else's.  If, for example, what one
philosopher does is principally just to <EM>illustrate</EM> a position
which he takes to have been placed beyond dispute by another philosopher,
then it will hardly be possible to discover, from <EM>his</EM> writings,
what the ultimate grounds are on which that position rests.
</P>

<P>
For these reasons, it would be idle to try to identify the key premise of
recent irrationalist philosophy of science, from the writings of Lakatos,
Feyerabend, or Kuhn.  Lakatos is the only one of these three who is a
clear enough reasoner to hold out any hope of such identification.  But it
is in fact impossible in all three, because of the extremely derivative
character of their philosophy.  In their writings, irrationalism
about scientific theories functions, not as a conclusion at all, but
as a premise, and as an inexplicit and scarcely-conscious one at that.
Of what such irrationalism is a <EM>consequence</EM>, it is the least
of their concerns to make clear.  They are hardly to be looked to even
for the <EM>enunciation</EM> of general irrationalist theses about
science, such as Popper scatters so freely over his pages; still less,
therefore, are they to be looked to for the arguments for them.  In recent
irrationalist philosophy of science, these authors are <EM>fortunate
heirs</EM>, and like most persons of that kind, they are more concerned
to enjoy their inheritance than to enquire into the grounds of it.
Feyerabend and Kuhn made some slight additions to their irrationalist
inheritance; Lakatos made some trifling abridgements of it, as though he
were slightly uneasy about it; but what all of them chiefly did was simply
to <EM>illustrate</EM> it, from chosen episodes in the history of science.
</P>

<P>
Popper on the other hand, writing as he was a generation before these
authors, and for a less enlightened age, was obliged, as they never were,
to work for his irrationalist theses: to <EM>argue</EM> for them.  He it
was in fact, and no one else, who made `straight in the desert a highway'
for these writers, so that irrationalism could thereafter be treated as
a settled thing and a starting-point.  It is to Popper, therefore, and to
him alone, that we must look, in our attempt to identify the key premise
of recent irrationalism.  But since he is also a clearer reasoner than
any of our other authors, we can do so with some prospect of success.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
In such theses as those of Popper which were mentioned in the preceding
section, there is nothing <EM>new</EM>.  What were there cited as
representative expressions of new irrationalism, could equally be cited
as representative expressions of old scepticism.  That it is always
rational to suspend belief, is a thesis of Pyrrho as well as of Popper:
that from what has been experienced, nothing can be rationally inferred
about what has not, is a thesis of Hume as well as of Popper; and so on.
It <EM>is</EM> new, of course, to have such sceptical or irrationalist
theses as these filling huge books called "The Growth of Scientific
Knowledge" [<A HREF="notes.html#03-11">11</A>], "The Logic of Scientific
Discovery", etc., etc.  But then (as was said at the beginning of the
book), when it is obvious that knowledge has increased, authors who
wish to imply the opposite and yet retain plausibility <EM>must</EM>
write in ways apt to mislead their readers.  But in the substance, as
distinct from the literary form, of Popper's philosophy, nothing is new.
In particular, Popper himself makes clear (as I have said), that the
scepticism of Hume about inductive arguments is not only one of his own
irrationalist theses, but part of the immediate grounds of all the others.
</P>

<P>
In this dependence of Hume, Popper is only an extreme case of a general
condition.  For the influence of Hume on 20th-century philosophy of
science in general is in fact so great that it is scarcely possible to
exaggerate it.  He looms like a colossus over both of the main tendencies
in philosophy of science in the present century: the logical positivist
one, and the irrationalist one.  His empiricism, his insistence on the
fallibility of induction, and on the thesis which follows from those
two, of the permanent possibility of the falsity of any scientific
theory, are fundamental planks in the platform of both of these schools
of thought.  Where the two schools separate is that the irrationalists
further accept, while the logical positivists reject, Hume's further,
<EM>sceptical</EM>, thesis about induction: that the premise of an
inductive argument is no reason to believe its conclusion.  This is why
the logical positivists, in the 1940's and '50's set about constructing
what they called `confirmation-theory', `non-deductive logic', `the theory
of logical probability', or `inductive logic': a branch of logic which,
while being consistent with empiricism and inductive fallibilism, would
allow scientific theories to be objects of rational belief without being
<EM>certain</EM>.  The irrationalists, on the other hand, being Humean
sceptics and not merely fallibilists about induction, deny the possibility
of any such theory; and Popper, accordingly, makes the chief landmark of
`inductive logic', Carnap's <EM>Logical Foundations of Probability</EM>,
a principal target of his criticism [<A HREF="notes.html#03-12">12</A>].
</P>

<P>
In the sharpest possible contrast to all this, the influence of Hume
on philosophy of science in the 19th century was but slight.  For this
extraordinary reversal in the importance attached to Hume's philosophy of
science, the historical reason is obvious enough, at least in broad terms.
The crucial event was that one which for almost two hundred years had
been felt to be impossible, but which nevertheless took place near the
start of this century: the fall of the Newtonian empire in physics.
This catastrophe, and the period of extreme turbulence in physics
it inaugurated, changed the entire climate of philosophy of science.
Almost all philosophers of the 18th and 19th centuries, it was now clear,
has enormously exaggerated the certainty and the extent of scientific
knowledge.  What was needed, evidently, was a far less optimistic
philosophy of science, a rigorously <EM>fallibilist</EM> philosophy,
which would ensure that such fearful <EM>hubris</EM> as had been incurred
in connection with Newtonian physics should never be incurred again.
Well, the very thing needed was lying at hand, though long neglected; and
Hume, 150 years after his death, finally and fully came into his own.
</P>

<P>
Thus the revival of Hume's philosophy of science in this century was a
movement of retreat from that confidence in science which was so high,
and constantly rising, in the two preceding centuries, and which had
proved to be misplaced precisely where it was highest.  This retreat was
general, all empiricist philosophers taking part in it.  Popper and his
followers are simply those with whom the retreat turned into a rout.
<EM>They</EM> fell back <EM>all</EM> the way to Hume: not just to his
fallibilism but to his <EM>scepticism</EM> about induction; and hence
(since they were empiricists) to his scepticism in general about the
unobserved.
</P>

<P>
Their only object was, and has remained, to ensure that no scientific
theory should ever again become the object of over-confident belief;
since only in that way can it be guaranteed that such a fall as overtook
Newtonian pride will never be repeated.  Now, it was the belief that
a scientific theory can be <EM>certain</EM>, which had made that fall
possible.  So it must be re-affirmed, with Hume, that a scientific theory
is <EM>never deducible from</EM> the observational evidence for it.
On this negative logical Popper and his followers accordingly insist,
and insist <EM>ad nauseum</EM>, even though no empiricist any longer
dreams of denying it.  They insist on it to the exclusion of every other
logical relation which might exist between a scientific theory and the
evidence for it, and they deny, with Hume, that propositions about the
observed can ever be a positive reason to believe a scientific theory.
They must do so: otherwise, it might one day happen that a scientific
theory should again be mistaken for a certainty.  And that, for these
philosophers, is what must at any cost be prevented.
</P>

<P>
This same consuming anxiety, it is worthwhile to point out, finds
expression even in the very germ of Popper's philosophy: that is, in
his opinions as to what <EM>constitutes</EM> a scientific theory,
and what makes one such theory better than another.  The very mark
of a scientific theory, he thinks, is that it should be able to be
<EM>disproved</EM> by experience [<A HREF="notes.html#03-13">13</A>];
and one scientific theory is better than another (other things being
equal), he thinks, if it is <EM>more</EM> disprovable than the other
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-14">14</A>].  No opinions could express more
poignantly than these the depth of Popper's dread lest Newtonian
<EM>hubris</EM> should ever have a sequel.  For this is to say that
the very mark of a scientific theory is that it be possible for us to
<EM>repel</EM> any claims it might have on our belief, and that a theory
is the better, the <EM>more easily</EM> the burden of belief which it
threatens to impose on us can be put off.  And nothing, evidently, could
have suggested so strangely inverted a conception of science, except
the most intense recollection of the traumatic consequences of having
once fully believed a false theory.
</P>

<P>
Such is the genesis of Popper's philosophy of science.  It is a story of
one kind of reaction to the disappointment of extreme expectations: that
kind of reaction, namely, of which the best epitome is given in Aesop's
fable of the fox and the grapes.  The parallel would be complete if the
fox, having become convinced that neither he nor anyone else could ever
succeed in tasting grapes, should nevertheless write many long books on
the progress of viticulture.
</P>

<P>
We have made a beginning, then, in our attempt to identify the key
premise of recent irrationalist philosophy of science.  That premise
is to be looked for, among our authors, in Popper and nowhere else.
The irrationalism of Popper about scientific theories has turned out to be
no other than the scepticism of Hume concerning contingent propositions
about the unobserved.  We know what are the immediate grounds, both in
Hume and in Popper, of that irrationalism or scepticism: the conjunction
of the theses of empiricism and inductive scepticism.
</P>

<P>
It is obvious, furthermore, which of these two immediate grounds is
the <EM>key</EM> to the irrationalism of this consequences to their
conjunction.  It is the thesis of inductive scepticism.  From the
empiricist ground on its own no irrationalist consequence follows.
</P>

<P>
But all this is only a beginning, since what we have so far identified are
only the immediate grounds of Popper's irrationalism concerning scientific
theories.  What we want to know, however, are the ultimate grounds
of it.  At least, we want to know that ultimate ground without which
his philosophy of science would have no irrationalist implications.
</P>

<P>
The thesis of inductive scepticism cannot possibly be <EM>itself</EM> that
ultimate ground or premise of Popper's irrationalism.  It operates as a
tacit premise, indeed, in the philosophy of Feyerabend, Kuhn, and Lakatos;
but then, that is just the principal respect in which these philosophers
are careless beneficiaries of Popper's labors.  At no earlier period than
theirs in the entire history of philosophy could a respected philosopher
(not to say a sane man) have started from the <EM>assumption</EM> that the
observed can furnish no reason to believe anything about the unobserved.
Certainly Popper, writing in an earlier and less enlightened age, had to
have some <EM>argument</EM> for so startlingly irrationalist a thesis.
</P>

<P>
Our search for the key premise of our authors' irrationalism leads
us, then, to the question: what are the premises of Popper's argument
for scepticism about induction?  How was inductive scepticism itself
established?
</P>

<P>
Just as in general our other authors are derivative thinkers in relation
to Popper, so Popper in turn, here at any rate, is a derivative thinker in
relation to Hume.  Indeed, on this all-important matter of the grounds of
inductive scepticism, he is entirely so.  Popper's argument for scepticism
about induction is simply Hume's argument for it.  He has neither fault to
find with Hume's reasoning for this conclusion, nor anything to add to it.
"I regard Hume's formulation and treatment of the logical problem of
induction [...] a flawless gem" [<A HREF="notes.html#03-15">15</A>].
What Hume gave us, Popper says, is "a gem of priceless value [...]: a
simple, straightforward, logical refutation of any claim that induction
could be a valid argument, or a justifiable way of reasoning" [<A
HREF="notes.html#03-16">16</A>].
</P>

<P>
This being so, we know at any rate this much about the key premise of
Popper's argument for inductive scepticism: that it is the key premise,
whatever that is, of Hume's argument for the same conclusion.  For these
arguments are one and the same.
</P>

<P>
The reader of Popper is naturally led to expect, by such passages as
have just been quoted, that he is about to be told what this perfect
and simple argument of Hume's was.  But the reader is disappointed
in this expectation.  Hume's conclusion is there stated and endorsed
by Popper, but his argument for it is only praised, not stated.
There are, however, other places in his writings where he does attempt
to say what Hume's argument was [<A HREF="notes.html#03-17">17</A>].
These accounts differ widely in how much of the detail of Hume's
argument they disclose.  Some of them are mere hints of the argument, too
brief or obscure to make any of its internal structure visible at all
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-18">18</A>].  In other cases Popper's account
does succeed in making some of the structure of Hume's argument clear
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-19">19</A>].  For our purposes, however, what is
required is an account of Hume's argument which enables us to identify
its <EM>premises</EM>, and <EM>all</EM> of them.  From this point of
view all Popper's accounts of Hume's argument are extremely deficient.
It would be only with the greatest difficulty, if at all, that anyone
could learn from Popper what even <EM>one</EM> of Hume's premises was.
</P>

<P>
It should not surprise us that Popper has reproduced only very
incompletely the argument which he praises so lavishly.  On the contrary,
this was to be expected.  It is simply another instance of the obvious
rule which was stated earlier: that the more derivative a thinker is in
relation to another, that is, the more he regards that other as having
placed a certain conclusion beyond dispute, the less likely he is to make
clear what the original grounds were on which that conclusion rested.
</P>

<P>
The deficiencies of Popper's account of Hume's argument do not, however,
impose any obstacle to our enquiry.  They are simply an additional reason
why the historical focus of that enquiry must now go back beyond Popper.
We must simply identify that premise of <EM>Hume's</EM> argument for
inductive scepticism, without which it would not have its irrationalist
conclusion.  The fact that Popper's accounts of that argument are
very imperfect, does not matter at all.  Had he given ever so good an
account of it, still, since the argument in question, by Popper's own
testimony, is Hume's, it is Hume's argument to which we ought to turn
our attention.
</P>

<P>
The shift of the focus of our enquiry back to Hume, while it is in
any case necessary, is also attended by marked advantages.  For one
thing, Hume is a clearer reasoner than any of our four modern authors.
Secondly, and even more important, the circumstances in which Hume argued
for inductive scepticism were much more conducive to explicitness of
argument on this point than those in which Popper did.  Popper did so
in a period of catastrophic collapse of confidence in science (as well
as of confidence in much else) [<A HREF="notes.html#03-20">20</A>],
a period in which irrationalist theses, such as inductive scepticism,
were greedily embraced by many of his readers almost faster than Popper
could write them down.  Hume, living in a less enlightened age, had no
such assistance.  On the contrary, he had to argue for scepticism about
induction, not only from a standing start (as it were), but entirely
<EM>against</EM> the prevailing current of opinion.  The current of
Newtonian confidence, in particular, was already then so strong as to be
irresistible except by the hardiest of sceptics.  Popper, therefore, even
if his native talent for clear reasoning had been as great as Hume's,
was bound to be, on this subject, the less explicit reasoner of the two.

That Hume's philosophy of science is the source of a great deal of
subsequent irrationalism, has been, of course, widely recognized: for
example, by Bertrand Russell [<A HREF="notes.html#03-21">21</A>].  Indeed,
it is emphasised by Popper himself [<A HREF="notes.html#03-22">22</A>].
Popper does not admit, of course, that his own philosophy of science is
irrationalist, but it is as obvious to him as it is to everyone else that
Hume's is [<A HREF="notes.html#03-23">23</A>], and he has been admirably
explicit (as we have seen) in acknowledging the debt he owes to Hume.
</P>

<P>
In this respect our other authors compare very unfavorably with Popper.
Their debt to Hume's philosophy (which means in the end, as we have seen,
their debt to his sceptical thesis about induction) is not less than
Popper's; it is only less direct.  Yet one would look in vain in their
writings for any direct, indeed almost for any indirect, acknowledgment
of this indebtedness.  Indeed, one has only to recall the thesis to
which they are indebted (namely, the premise of an inductive argument
is no reason to believe its conclusion), to see at once how utterly
out of place it would have been for these authors even to mention it.
Popper had made Humean scepticism about induction so much <EM>de
rigueur</EM>, that even to affirm it had become extremely unfashionable;
almost as much so, indeed, as to deny it.  For the author of <EM>The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions</EM>, or of <EM>The Methodology of
Scientific Research Programmes</EM>, to introduce this simple old thesis
into <EM>their</EM> works, would have been felt as an intolerable piece
of rusticity.  The proprietor of a pornographic book shop may be dimly
conscious of a debt to the author of <EM>Areopagitica</EM>, but Milton
is the last person he wants to see in his shop.
</P>

<P>
In later works, however, there are two small and indirect indications
that these authors <EM>do</EM> after all recognize, in this homely thesis
of Hume, the progenitor of their own irrationalism.
</P>

Lakatos' philosophy of science was no sooner published than it was
outflanked on the left (so to speak) by the still more irrationalist
philosophy of his friend Feyerabend.  Thus by a manoeuvre not the less
amusing for being familiar, Lakatos found himself placed, late in
his life, in the unaccustomed role of <EM>defender</EM> of science,
<EM>against</EM> neo-Popperian irrationalism.  In this extremity (we
are told by Feyerabend, who is here referring mainly to unpublished
discussions between them), Lakatos was reduced to objecting that even
irrationalist philosophers do not "walk out of the window of a 50-story
building instead of using the lift" [<A HREF="notes.html#03-24">24</A>].
Feyerabend admits he was baffled by this objection "for quite a while"; as
anyone might have been, by an objection so extremely <EM>recherche</EM>.
Finally, however, he found a reply which the irrationalist can make to
it, and he gravely explains what it is.  This reply is fully as original
as the objection, and is in fact, though apparently all-unknowingly,
pure Hume.  It does not matter, Feyerabend tells us, what he or anyone
else "does or does not do", or feel, about walking out of high windows;
what matters is that neither he nor anyone else "can give <EM>reasons</EM>
for his fear" of doing so [<A HREF="notes.html#03-25">25</A>].

Kuhn provides a less picturesque but equally clear belated acknowledgment
of the central part played in his philosophy of science by scepticism
about induction.  In an article first published in 1977, he tells us
that, if he finds himself unable to avoid certain views of science
which some people regard as irrationalist, "that is only another way
of saying that I make no claim to have solved the problem of induction"
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-26">26</A>].

The ordinary philosopher comes across these two passages with mingled
relief, astonishment, and indignation.  Relief, because what he had
privately believed all along, he now finds indirectly admitted, and
admitted by the emperors themselves: that they have no clothes at
all, except such as are woven out of Hume's scepticism about induction.
Astonishment and indignation, because previously and apart from these two
passages, nothing in these authors had prepared him for such an admission,
and everything had in fact pointed the other way.  There is <EM>not one
word</EM> in Kuhn's <EM>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</EM>
from which a reader could infer that Kuhn believes that a problem of
induction exists; much less infer that he believes it to have something
to do with his philosophy of science.  As for the debate about the
rationality of believing one can safely walk out of high windows: what
is this `pastoral-comical' scene, in which Lakatos plays Beattie to
Feyerabend's Hume, but an admission that what is principally at stake
between irrationalists and their critics is the sceptical thesis of Hume
about the possibility of learning from experience?  A thesis which was
old when Sextus Empiricus wrote, and which requires for its discussion
examples no more esoteric than Hume's own  about walking out of windows
[<A HREF="notes.html#03-27">27</A>], or the one always associated with
Pyrrho, of walking over cliffs [<A HREF="notes.html#03-28">28</A>]!
"But until now", the indignant reader exclaims, "these authors had led me
to believe that, before I could enter the lists against their philosophy
of science, I would have to have read at least as much as they have
written about Galileo and the telescope, about Lavoisier and oxygen, about
the Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory, about the Lummer-Pringsheim experiments,
etc., etc.  What!  Was all of this really quite inessential all along?
Was it bestowed on me, then principally, <EM>ad terrorum</EM>?" Alas,
poor reader, it was.
</P>

<P>
However belated or infrequent their own acknowledgment of it, then,
the philosophy of these authors depends, no less critically than the
philosophy of Popper does, on the scepticism of Hume about induction.
This historical fact has some extremely curious corollaries.  For example,
that had it not been for the author of the most famous of all attacks
on the credibility of miracles, the author of <EM>Against Method</EM>
would not have believed a vulgar charlatan who claimed to become a
raven from time to time [<A HREF="notes.html#03-29">29</A>].  But it
is in any case a fact, and we must now turn to the argument of Hume
on which this all-important thesis of irrationalist philosophy rests.
For the key premise, whatever it is, of Hume's argument for inductive
scepticism, is also the key to our whole enquiry.
