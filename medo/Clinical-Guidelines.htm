addressed in recent years. Efforts in this direction have been supplemented by
work in the areas of guidelines for clinical practice and
computer-interpretable workflow and careflow models.In what follows we present
the outlines of a framework for understanding the relations between
organizations, guidelines, individual patients and patient-related functions.
The derived framework provides a means to extract the knowledge contained in
the guideline text at different granularities, in ways that can help us to assign
tasks within the healthcare organization and to assess clinical performance in
realizing the guideline. It does this in a way that preserves the flexibility
of the organization in the adoption of the guidelines. </span></p>

	formalize the relations between the different Semantic Types in the Semantic 
	Network of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) in the context of 
	computer interpretable task-based clinical guidelines model. <strong>Design:</strong> 
	We used the Semantic Type Collections as our basis in the formalization. We 
	defined some operators based on the relations which we considered were 
	applicable to all the Semantic Types in the Collection. <strong>Measurement:</strong> 
	We separated the relations dealing with the Semantic Types Diagnostic 
	Procedure, Laboratory Procedure and Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure. We 
	calculated the ratio of the total relations in UMLS Semantic Network to the 
	adjacent relations of these Semantic Types and also the percentage of 
	Semantic Types who have an adjacent relations with these Semantic Types.
	<strong>Result: </strong>Without the consideration of Semantic Type 
	Collection, the total adjacent relations for these three Semantic Types was 
	6.87% of the total and these covered almost half of the total Semantic Types 
	on an average. With the consideration of Semantic Type Collection, we were 
	able to represent these relations and also cover the whole UMLS Semantic 
	Network. <strong>Conclusion:</strong> With the formalization of the mapping 
	operators for the adjacent Semantic Types with respect to the three Semantic 
	Types, the next step would be to map the non-adjacent ones to those three 
	Semantic Types following a path with least distance.</span></p>

&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Evidence-based medicine relies on the execution of
clinical practice guidelines and protocols. A great deal of of effort has been
invested in the development of various tools which automate the representation
and execution of the recommendations contained within such guidelines and
protocols by creating Computer Interpretable Guideline Models (CIGMs).
Context-based task ontologies (CTOs), based on standard terminology systems
like UMLS, form one of the core components of such a model. We have created
DAML+OIL-based CTOs for the tasks mentioned in the WHO guideline for
hypertension management, drawing comparisons also with other related
guidelines. The advantages of CTOs include: contextualization of ontologies,
providing ontologies tailored to specific aspects of the phenomena of interest,
dividing the complexity involved in creating ontologies into different levels,
providing a methodology by means of which the task recommendations contained
within guidelines can be integrated into the clinical practices of a health
care set-up.</span></p>

and guidelines, which is then used as the basis for a framework for
implementing guideline-based systems for the management of workflow in health
care organizations. The framework has a number of special features, above all
in that it enables us to represent in formal terms assignments of work-items
both to individuals and to teams and to tailor guideline to specific contexts
of application in health care organizations. It is designed also to enable
implementations to do justice to the fact that the processes carried out in
health care organizations may deviate in different ways from the norms set
forth in corresponding guideline definitions. This means that implementations
built in conformity with the framework will be marked by a type of flexibility
that might make them more likely to be accepted by healthcare professionals
than are standard guideline-based management systems.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Objective</span></i><span style="font-size:
9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">: Clinical guidelines are special
types of plans realized by collective agents. We provide an ontological theory
of such plans that is designed to support the construction of a framework in
which guideline-based information systems can be employed in the management of
workflow in health care organizations. <i>Method</i>: The framework we propose
allows us to represent in formal terms how clinical guidelines are realized
through the actions of individuals organized into teams. We provide various
levels of implementation representing different levels of conformity on the
part of health care organizations. <i>Result</i>: Implementations built in
conformity with our framework are marked by two dimensions of flexibility that
are designed to make them more likely to be accepted by health care
professionals than are standard guideline-based management systems. They do
justice to the fact (1) that responsibilities within a health care organization
are widely shared, and (2) that health care professionals may on different
occasions be noncompliant with guidelines for a variety of well justified
reasons. <i>Conclusion</i>: The advantage of the framework lies in its built-in
flexibility, its sensitivity to clinical context, and its ability to use
inference tools based on a robust ontology. One disadvantage lies in the
complication of its implementation. </span></p>

margin-left:76.5pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In this paper we propose a formal theory of partitions
(ways of dividing up or sorting or mapping reality) and we show how the theory
can be applied in the geospatial domain. We characterize partitions at two
levels: as systems of cells (theory A), and in terms of their projective
relation to reality (theory B). We lay down conditions of well-formedness for
partitions and we define what it means for partitions to project truly onto
reality. We continue by classifying well-formed partitions along three axes:
(a) degree of correspondence between partition cells and objects in reality;
(b) degree to which a partition represents the mereological structure of the domain
it is projected onto; and (c) degree of completeness and exhaustiveness with
which a partition represents reality. This classification is used to
characterize three types of partitions that play an important role in spatial
information science: cadastral partitions, categorical coverages, and the
partitions involved in folk categorizations of the geospatial domain.</span></p>

approach to the understanding of ontologies and other classificatory systems.
The paper explores the use of this new theory in the treatment of task-based
clinical guidelines as a means for better understanding the relations between
different clinical tasks, both within the framework of a single guideline and
between related guidelines. We used as our starting point a DAML+OIL-based
ontology for the WHO guideline for hypertension management, comparing this with
related guidelines and attempting to show that TGP provides a flexible and
highly expressive basis for the manipulation of ontologies of a sort which
might be useful in providing more adequate Computer Interpretable Guideline
Models (CIGMs) in the future. </span></p>
