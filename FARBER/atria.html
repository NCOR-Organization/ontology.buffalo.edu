<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#008080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Law as Institutional
Fact</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>Ten years
ago, Paul Amselek (1988: 187) said that "philosophy of law should feel
particularly challenged by the theory of speech acts". If anything, this
is more true today, after the publication of John Searle&rsquo;s recent <I>The
Construction of Social Reality</I>. Most of Searle&rsquo;s examples of institutional
facts are <I>legal</I> concepts. As Amselek said, "[in the legal world]
philosophers of language felt that they had found a domain particularly
suited to illustrate and test their ideas" .</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>If the law
is a &lsquo;domain particularly suited to illustrate&rsquo; those ideas, then the application
of those ideas to the law must be a fruitful enterprise. This is what Neil
MacCormick and Ota Weinberger showed in their joint work <I>An Institutional
Theory of Law</I> (1986).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>In his inaugural
lecture, MacCormick argued that "if the law exists at all, it exists not
on the level of brute creation (...) but rather (...) on the plane of institutional
facts". What makes propositions of law true or false, he tells us, is not
"merely the occurrence of acts or events in the world, but also the application
of rules to such acts or events" (MacCormick, 1974: 51). Contracts, for
example, are legal institutions. But legal institutions are not identical
with rules, since the institution of a contract is one thing, the contract
I have with Edinburgh University another. MacCormick&rsquo;s claim is that institutions
are &lsquo;concepts&rsquo;, concepts that are regulated by rules in the sense that
instantiations of them can be brought about, have consequences and be terminated
according to those rules:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>The term
&lsquo;institution of law&rsquo;, as I shall use it, is therefore to be understood
as signifying those legal concepts which are regulated by sets of institutive,
consequential and terminative rules, with the effect that instances of
them are properly said to exist over a period of time, from the occurrence
of an institutive act or event until the occurrence of a terminative act
or event (MacCormick, 1974: 53).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>According
to MacCormick, <I>institutive rules</I> are those that "lay down that on
the occurrence of a certain (perhaps complex) act or event a specific instance
of the institution in question comes into existence" (1974: 52); <I>consequential</I>
are those rules that provide for the consequences the existence of an instance
of a given institution has. Lastly, rules are <I>terminative</I> when they
provide for the termination of the particular instance of the institution
under consideration (53).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>Contrary
to what we may think from the title of his article, MacCormick claims that
it does not follow from the fact that legal concepts (or at least some
of them) are &lsquo;institutions&rsquo; (and hence that the existence, effects and
termination of instances of them are determined according to rules) that
<I>the law</I> itself is an institution: "there is an almost overwhelming
temptation (...) to treat the concept &lsquo;law&rsquo; like the concept &lsquo;contract&rsquo;
as denoting an institution which is defined and regulated by the relevant
set of institutive consequential and regulative rules" (MacCormick, 1974:
57). This temptation must be resisted, for</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>even if
we accept the view that the social institutions concerned with making,
declaring, elaborating and enforcing the law are and ought to be governed
in their action by legal norms we cannot <I>eo ipso</I> assume that all
the norms in question are like statutes in that they can be conceived as
existing &lsquo;validly&rsquo; in virtue of clearly statable institutive rules. It
is at least contestable whether there are clear criteria for the existence
of rules of common law. Some have indeed contended that it is a fallacy
of positivism to suppose that the common law can be represented as a system
or rules (1974: 57).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>But why should
the claim that the law is an institution be given up in such a scenario?
MacCormick&rsquo;s answer is: because the existence, consequence and termination
of rules of common law would not be controlled by institutive, consequential
and terminative rules.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>But MacCormick
is giving up too much ground here. Because (if) the institutive, terminative
and consequential rules relating to the common law as a source of law do
not render sufficient and necessary criteria of validity, then the common
law cannot be an institution (as MacCormick says in 1974: 57, just quoted
). But if that is the case, then all legal concepts MacCormick <I>is</I>
willing to call &lsquo;institutions&rsquo; and whose institutive, consequential and
terminative rules are (at least partly) to be found in rules of the common
law cannot be institutions because of the very same reason, <I>i.e.</I>
because those rules would not completely regulate the (creation, consequences
and termination of instances of the) concept. A contract, for example,
can exist even if the institutive rules have not been followed (MacCormick
gives an example of this: 1974: 68), and it can fail to exist even if the
institutive rules have been followed (MacCormick and Weinberger give also
an example of this: 1986: 12) Thus it seems that either the law is an institution
along with the others, or none of them is.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>Later in
his lecture, MacCormick returns to this subject. He accepts (as did Hart,
1948) that institutive, consequential and terminative rules are <I>defeasible</I>,
with the consequence that they cannot specify necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of an instance of an institution of law:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>It is the
open-ended nature of the exceptions justified by the principles of natural
justice, abuse of discretion, and such like, which would be fatal to any
attempt to represent the express institutive rules as containing necessary
and sufficient conditions for valid adjudication by tribunals or whatever.
Even if, for any given administrative institution, we were to write out
the statutory rules, including in them all the exceptions hitherto imposed
by the courts in that and analogous cases, we could not be confident that
we had succeeded in listing the sufficient conditions for validity of a
determination or an act of delegated legislation or whatever (MacCormick,
1974: 70).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>And what he
says here about institutive rules can equally be said "in relation to the
other types of rule which I have mentioned, and indeed of &lsquo;rules of law&rsquo;
generally" (1974: 73). What rules of law laid down are only &lsquo;presumptively
sufficient&rsquo; conditions:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>in so far
as at any moment in time statute or common law imposes clear requirements
for the validity of an act in law any act which conforms to those requirements
ought to be presumed to be valid unless it is challenged; such challenge
must be based either on the proposition that the legal requirements have
nor &lsquo;really&rsquo; been satisfied, <I>i.e.</I> should be construed more narrowly
or widely that hitherto (...) or that the presence of some further factor
should be taken as vitiating the validity of the act or institution (1974:
72).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>Can we not say,
on the strength of this argument, that the law is also an institution?
Could we not argue that, even if Dworkin and others critics of positivism
are correct in claiming that principles of law cannot be identified according
to sufficient and necessary formal conditions of validity or that the common
law cannot be understood as a system of rules in the positivistic sense,
those formal criteria of validity for principles and rules of common law
are only &lsquo;presumptively sufficient&rsquo;? Would not the MacCormickean notion
of &lsquo;presumptive validity&rsquo; allow us to consider the law as an institution
without having to solve the controversy between positivism and its critics?</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>MacCormick&rsquo;s
answer is not straightforward: "we neither have criteria of validity for
legal principles, nor therefore a distinction between valid and invalid
principles of law" (MacCormick, 1974: 73). Though it is possible to give
an account of what makes true the statement &lsquo;the principle &lsquo;no one may
profit from his or her own wrong&rsquo; is a principle of English law&rsquo;, how those
conditions actually work is something that cannot be understood without
considering the values and purposes of the law.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>But exactly
the same can be said of contract, testaments and other legal concepts.
MacCormick himself acknowledges that "&lsquo;law&rsquo;, even in its purely normative
significance, spills over the edges of the valid rules. Rules as institutional
facts are not the whole of the law, though they are singularly important
of it" (MacCormick, 1974: 74). This is true not only concerning the common
law, but also regarding the institutive, consequential and terminative
rules that regulate all other legal concepts.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>I believe
that the solution for this problem is to accept the institutional nature
of the law even if there are no rules stating sufficient and necessary
conditions of validity for rules or principles of the common law.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>This would
require that the notion of institutional fact be adjusted to cater for
the fact that the law &lsquo;spills over the edges of valid rules&rsquo;. MacCormick
believes that a theory of law cannot go that far. It is at this point,
he argues, where "the philosopher may still pose questions, but he will
have either to become a sociologist to answer some of them, or alternatively,
have to wait for his sociological colleagues to give him the answers" (1974:
74).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+0>In the next
section, I would like to offer an explanation for the defeasibility of
legal rules based on the kind of institution the law happens to be. An
adequate explanation of the law&rsquo;s nature will help us to see that legal
rules (as opposed to, say, rules of games) are defeasible not because they
are <I>rules</I>, but because they are <I>legal.</I></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#008080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle on
Constitutive And Regulative Rules</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>In this paper
I want to comment upon Professor Searle&rsquo;s famous distinction between constitutive
and regulative rules. His recent articulation of that distinction in a
more ambitious &lsquo;general theory of institutional facts&rsquo; may be used as an
initial justification for my going through this familiar subject.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>I will try
to show that Searle&rsquo;s distinction has to be seen as a distinction not between
rules but institutions (or systems of rules) of different kinds.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This is particularly
important, I shall argue, when Searle&rsquo;s distinction is applied to institutions
like the law. It explains what is special about the law when it is compared
to, say, games that makes disagreement so pervasive in the former and so
rare in the latter. Here, however, I will have space only to point out
the problems that a &lsquo;general theory of institutional facts&rsquo; faces when
this is not recognised.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>In an often-quoted
passage, Searle introduces his now famous distinction:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>I want to
clarify a distinction between two different sorts of rules, which I shall
call <I>regulative</I> and <I>constitutive</I> rules (...). As a start,
we might say that regulative rules regulate antecedently or independently
existing forms of behaviour; for example, many rules of etiquette regulate
inter-personal relationships which exist independently of the rules. But
constitutive rules do not merely regulate, they create or define new forms
of behaviour. The rules of football or chess, for example, do not merely
regulate playing football or chess, but as it were they create the very
possibility of playing such games (Searle, 1969: 33).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>One criticism
that has been levelled against Searle is that his distinction is artificial.
Anthony Giddens, for example, has argued that "that there is something
suspect in this distinction, as referring to two types of rule, is indicated
by the etymological clumsiness of the term &lsquo;regulative rule&rsquo;. After all,
the word &lsquo;regulative&rsquo; already implies &lsquo;rule&rsquo;: its dictionary definition
is &lsquo;controlled by rules&rsquo;" (Giddens, 1984: 20). Giddens&rsquo;s point here being,
I suppose, that all rules are regulative somehow.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>I do not
know whether Searle would agree with Giddens in that all rules are regulative,
though at times he seems to hint at an affirmative answer (he speaks of
&lsquo;<I>purely </I>regulative&rsquo; rules, and says that &lsquo;constitutive rules do
not <I>merely</I> regulate&rsquo;). If this is the case, then <I>all </I>rules
can not also be constitutive, since in that case there would be no distinction
whatsoever. Are, then, all rules constitutive? Searle answers:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>There is
a trivial sense in which the creation of any rule creates the possibility
of new forms of behaviour, namely, behaviour done as in accordance with
the rule. That is not the sense in which my remark is intended. What I
mean can perhaps be best put in the formal mode. Where the rule is purely
regulative, behaviour which is in accordance with the rule could be given
the same description or specification (...) whether or not the rule existed,
provided the description or specification makes no explicit reference to
the rule. But where the rule (or system of rules) is constitutive, behaviour
which is in accordance with the rule can receive specifications or descriptions
which it could not receive if the rule or rules did not exist (Searle,
1969: 35)<A NAME="A_Ref407187353"></A>.</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This allows
at least for constitutive-and-partially-regulative and purely regulative
rules. But this presents, I believe, an interesting question: can &lsquo;purely
regulative&rsquo; rules exist in the context of institutional systems? (&lsquo;institutions&rsquo;
being, following Searle for a while, &lsquo;systems of constitutive rules&rsquo;).
Are there purely regulative <I>legal</I> rules, for example?</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Tony Honor&eacute;
has claimed that a satisfactory theory of individuation of laws must allow
for the following kinds of laws:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>1. <I>Existence
laws</I> create, destroy or provide for the existence or non-existence
of entities.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>2. <I>Rules
of inference</I> provide how facts may or must or should preferably be
proved and what inferences may or must or should preferably be drawn from
evidence.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>3. <I>Categorizing
laws</I> explain how to translate actions, events, and other facts into
the appropriate categories.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>4. <I>Rules
of scope</I> fix the scope of other rules.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>5. <I>Position-specifying
rules</I> set out the legal position of persons and things in terms of
rights, liabilities, status, and the like.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>6. <I>Directly
normative rules</I> (which are a few in number but important) guide the
conduct of the citizen as such (Honor&eacute;, 1977: 118).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>I hope it is
clear that items 1 through 5 cannot be purely regulative. Rules of the
third type, for example, &lsquo;A young person is any person who has attained
the age of 14 years and is under the age of 17 years&rsquo; (Honor&eacute;, 1977:
102), clearly constitutes paradigmatic instances of constitutive rules,
<I>i.e.</I> rules of the form &lsquo;X counts as Y in C&rsquo; (Searle, 1995: 43ff).
The same can be said of items 1, 2, 4 and 5.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This leaves
out only 6, &lsquo;directly normative rules&rsquo;. Are they not purely regulative?
They certainly do not <I>constitute</I> what they regulate: if they did,
they would fall into another category. The problem is, these rules cannot
be purely regulative since they are expressed in institutional terms. These
rules are almost tautological (Searle seems to believe that they are, in
fact, tautologies: 1969, at 191).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>A rule like
&lsquo;perform contracts&rsquo; is not purely regulative, since rules are required
for some descriptions of the an action in accordance with it. Nor is it
constitutive, since <I>it</I> is not required for such a description.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>If this is
correct, we can see a more interesting problem concerning the two criteria
Searle has offered to distinguish regulative from constitutive rules. That
problem is that those criteria do not necessarily overlap, because they
answer different questions. As Geoffrey Warnock said:</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This supposed
distinction between &lsquo;two sorts&rsquo; of rules is really, I think, a confused
groping after two other distinctions. There is, first, a distinction between
two ways of saying what people do</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>—</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>one
way which, as for instance walking, or hitting balls about, or waving flags,
involves no reference to any rules, and another which, as for instance
playing tennis, or signalling, or bequeathing property, does essentially
make reference to rules, or presupposes them. Then, second there is a broad
and rather woolly distinction between two different &lsquo;objects&rsquo; of rules,
or reasons for having them. It is not the <I>object</I>, presumably, of
the criminal law to &lsquo;create the possibility&rsquo; of committing criminal offences,
though it incidentally does so; the object is to &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; in certain
respects the conduct of members of society. By contrast, while the rules
of, say, soccer do &lsquo;regulate&rsquo; the way in which balls are kicked about in
fields, it is in this case the <I>object</I> of (some of) the rules to
&lsquo;constitute&rsquo; a certain exercise in physical skill and ingenuity, to &lsquo;create&rsquo;
a particular game for people to play (Warnock, 1971: 38).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Now having Warnock&rsquo;s
passage in mind, let us consider the two criteria of Searle&rsquo;s distinction.
As should be remembered, the first criterion was</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>regulative
rules regulate antecedently or independently existing forms of behaviour
(...). But constitutive rules do not merely regulate, they create or define
new forms of behaviour. The rules of football or chess, for example, do
not merely regulate playing football or chess, but as it were they create
the very possibility of playing such games (Searle, 1969: 33).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Both Warnock
and Searle agree that criminal law is in this sense regulative (since it
does not exist in order to create the possibility of committing offences)
while chess is constitutive (for Searle&rsquo;s agreement concerning criminal
law, <I>see</I> 1995: 50).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>The second
criterion was</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Where the
rule is purely regulative, behaviour which is in accordance with the rule
could be given the same description or specification (...) whether or not
the rule existed, provided the description or specification makes no explicit
reference to the rule. But where the rule (or system of rules) is constitutive,
behaviour which is in accordance with the rule can receive specifications
or descriptions which it could not receive if the rule or rules did not
exist (Searle, 1969: 35).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, this criterion
tells a rather different story. Consider criminal law: in developed legal
systems, the rules of criminal law are needed to describe, for example,
that Jones is &lsquo;guilty&rsquo; of &lsquo;murder in the first degree&rsquo; though he was benefited
by &lsquo;mitigating circumstances&rsquo; etc. Hence according to the second criterion
the rules of criminal law are constitutive (and—recall Honor&eacute;&rsquo;s
argument—this applies to <I>all</I> the rules of criminal law).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle&rsquo;s
new general theory of institutional facts is still liable to this problem.
This time the distinction makes its appearance in the book (1995: 27) with
the help of the following pair of examples: &lsquo;drive on the right-hand side
of the road&rsquo; (regulative) and &lsquo;the rules of chess&rsquo; (constitutive). Here
we can see Searle using the first criterion. The &lsquo;drive on the right&rsquo; rule
is said to be regulative because it regulates driving and driving is an
antecedently existing form of behaviour, while rules of chess are constitutive
because they &lsquo;create the very possibility&rsquo; of playing chess .</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>When we try
to apply Searle&rsquo;s second criterion to the first rule, however, we run into
troubles. Imagine that it is section (1) of the highway code:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>(1) Drive
on the right hand side of the road.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Imagine further
that section (2) is</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>(2) failure
to comply with section (1) of this statute shall constitute a misdemeanour,
punishable by fine of $50.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>In this case
(1) would be constitutive since "behaviour which is in accordance with
the rule can receive specifications or descriptions which it could not
receive if the rule or rules did not exist" (Searle, 1969: 35).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>One way out
of this problem is to say that the literal formulation of the particular
rule under consideration is decisive. In this case, (1) would be purely
regulative because <I>it</I> does not mention the word &lsquo;misdemeanour&rsquo;.
(1&rsquo;), however, would be constitutive:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>(1&rsquo;) Not
to drive on the right hand side of the road counts as a misdemeanour.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This, however,
would demote the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules
to the category of a stylistic distinction, and I do not think Searle would
agree with that. In brief, unless Searle wants to say that the distinction
is a stylistic distinction, it is not enough to know the content of a particular
rule to know whether it is regulative or constitutive.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>And we can
see how the problem reappears as the &lsquo;general theory of institutional facts&rsquo;
is developed. I submit that Searle developed that theory without having
in mind the crucial distinction between <I>systems of rules</I> suggested
by the first criterion: the distinction between criminal law (regulative
of independently existing forms of behaviour) and chess (constitutive of
chess). Some of his remarks, accordingly, fit institutions like the law,
but fail to fit, as we shall see shortly, systems of rules whose point
is to create new possibilities of behaviour rather than to regulate some
antecedently existing form of it (<I>e.g.</I> games). For reasons of space,
I will focus upon two moments of the theory, in which the problem is, I
believe, particularly noticeable.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#800080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Systematic
relationships between institutional facts</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>One feature
of institutional facts, according to Searle, is that they "cannot exist
in isolation but only in a set of systematic relationships to other facts"
(1995: 35). For money to exist a system of exchange has to exist beforehand,
and for a system of exchange there has to be a system of property and property
ownership. "Similarly, in order that society should have marriages, they
must have some form of contractual relationships. But in order that they
can have contractual relationships, they must have such things as promises
and obligations".</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Generally
speaking, the existence of institutions that are as a whole regulative
presupposes the existence of the practice that the institution is there
to regulate. The reason for this is rather obvious: the point of the institution
is the regulation of the practice. But institutions have these relationships
because of their regulative character, not because they are institutions.
Concerning games, for example, the point is less straightforward.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle, however,
thinks that games are not counterexamples to his claim, though "it might
seem" that they are, "because, of course, games are designed to be forms
of activity that do not connect with the rest of our lives in a way that
institutional facts characteristically do" (1995: 36). When this point
is looked at carefully, Searle claims,</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>even in
the case of games there are systematic dependencies on other forms of institutional
facts. The position of the pitcher, the catcher, and the batter, for example,
all involve rights and responsibilities; and their positions and actions
or inactions are unintelligible without an understanding of these rights
and responsibilities; but these notions are in turn unintelligible without
the general notions of rights and responsibilities (Searle, 1995: 36).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This cannot
be correct. We can understand, make sense of, and even <I>play</I> chess
without knowing a thing about whatever &lsquo;general notions&rsquo; were used in India
during or before the 6th century (or wherever and whenever it was invented:
that we do not need to be sure of its origins to play it is another way
of making the point). Baseball and football are played all over the world,
and that is not a proof that the notions of &lsquo;rights, obligations and responsibilities&rsquo;
are common to the human race at large.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#800080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Institutions
and their Consequences</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT></FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>So let us
go back to the quotation in page 36, where Searle claims that "It might
seem that games are counterexamples to this general principle, because,
of course, games are designated to be forms of activity that do not connect
with the rest of our lives in a way that institutional facts characteristically
do" (Searle, 1995: 36).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>The sentence
that immediately follows seems to imply that the way in which institutional
facts characteristically connect to our lives is that the former have <I>consequences</I>
for the latter: "Today&rsquo;s philosophy department softball game need have
no consequences for tomorrow, in a way that today&rsquo;s wars (...etc) are intended
precisely to have consequences for tomorrow".</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle thinks
that it is a peculiarity of games that they do not have consequences that
are characteristic of institutions. I believe that that is precisely the
mark of constitutive institutions, shared not only by games but also by,
for example, geometry or mathematics and the like. And precisely because
they do not have &lsquo;consequences for tomorrow&rsquo; they need have no systematic
relationships with other facts.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>I do not
want to object to the thesis that <I>some</I> institutions stand in systematic
relationships with other institutional and non-institutional facts. In
fact, this is an extraordinarily important and usually disregarded feature
of institutions like the law. But this is not a characteristic of institutions
as such, but only of institutions that are, according to my version of
Searle&rsquo;s first criterion, regulative, <I>because</I> they are regulative.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>This might
seem beside the point, since Searle explicitly accepts in the statement
quoted above that institutions need not have these consequences. What Searle
misses is that institutions have &lsquo;systematic relationships to other facts&rsquo;
<I>because</I> they have &lsquo;broader consequences&rsquo;: games do not have consequences,
hence they need not have those relationships.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#800080"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Evolution
of Institutions</FONT></FONT></FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>The second
problem in the general theory is related to the issue of the evolution
of institutions. Can institutions evolve without the participants&rsquo; being
aware that they are evolving one?</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle&rsquo;s
answer is: indeed they can. Consider the example of money: people can go
around buying and selling and exchanging, without their thinking that the
particular goods they use as a medium of exchange is &lsquo;money&rsquo;:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>The evolution
may be such that the participants think, <I>e.g.</I> &lsquo;I can exchange this
for gold&rsquo;, &lsquo;this is valuable&rsquo;, or even simply &lsquo;this is money&rsquo;. They need
not think &lsquo;we are collectively imposing a value on something that we do
not regard as valuable because of its purely physical features&rsquo;, even though
that is exactly what they are doing (...). In the course of consciously
buying, selling, exchanging, etc., they may simply evolve institutional
facts (Searle, 1995: 47).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Patrick Atiyah
(1981) has made a similar point:.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
<UL><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>It is thus
simply wrong to say boldly that promising is impossible unless one first
presupposes an institution or practice of promising which enables promises
to be made. It needs no institution and no rules (other than linguistic
ones) for a person to induce another to rely upon him (or trust him) and
them let the other down in such a way as to generate a sense of grievance.
Equally it needs no institution and no rules for a person to render benefits
to another in such a way as to raise expectations of reciprocity, so that
again a sense of grievance may arise if no return is received. These are
cases in which it would often be accepted today that an implied promise
exists; and it is therefore clear that implied promises can be conceived
without an institution of promising (Atiyah, 1981: 120).</FONT></FONT></FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>But he later
acknowledges that this is not an obstacle to see that "there is a grain
of truth in the argument that the institution must come first", since promises
"presuppose understanding of the notion of obligation" (121). It is also
the case that wholly executory promises require the institution (121).
I believe that Atiyah&rsquo;s point is basically very similar to the one developed
here: since the whole of the institution of promising is regulative, not
constitutive, there must be something behind the institution, something
that could be done before the institution was invented. The fact that the
institution brings in a different apparatus (<I>i.e.</I> institutional
facts and their institutive, consequential and terminative rules) explain
the &lsquo;grain of truth&rsquo; Atiyah finds. The institution, then, can evolve on
the back of the practice: promises can evolve on the back of implied promises.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>But it is
difficult to see how this can happen concerning constitutive institutions.
When I was a boy we used to play football in a park. As there were, of
course, no goal posts in the park, we had to use our jumpers and bags as
goalposts. The first time my friends did this I could not understand what
were they up to, until one of them said: &lsquo;this is your goal, and that is
ours&rsquo;. We could not have played football in the park had we not been aware
of the fact that by placing those bags and jumpers where we placed them
we where collectively assigning meaning to them, a meaning that was not
exhausted by the physical properties of the bags and jumpers. In other
words, there are no implied goals or goal posts on the back of which football
can grow up.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#008080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Constitutive
and Regulative <I>Institutions</I></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>I think that
the first of the two criteria offered by Searle to characterise institutions
is the important one. According to it, the law is a regulative institution,
since its point is to regulate antecedently existing forms of behaviour
. Games, on the other hand, are constitutive institutions, that is, systems
of rules whose point is to create new possibilities of behaviour rather
than to regulate antecedently existing forms of it.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>The reason
why I call both of them &lsquo;institutions&rsquo; is because both of them characteristically
allow the creation of institutional facts, like offences and goals: thus,
it turns out that the first of Searle&rsquo;s criteria distinguishes types of
institutions, while the second can be used to establish the existence of
institutional facts.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New"><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>If this is
correct, a crucial conclusion follows (though the full argument for it
has not been presented here): the defeasibility of legal rules, probably
the single most important phenomenon around which most of the literature
on legal reasoning has been produced, is to be explained by the systemic
features of the institution of law. Institutional reasoning is not necessarily
defeasible: against authors like H. L. A. Hart, the above argument would
lead us to realise that legal rules are defeasible not because they are
<I>rules</I>, but because they are <I>legal</I>. One could, for example,
use the reading of Searle presented above to explain why we develop what
Dworkin (1986) calls &lsquo;an interpretative attitude&rsquo; concerning some of our
practices and some of our practices only.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
