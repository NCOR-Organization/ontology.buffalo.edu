<P><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">0 Introduction</FONT></I>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The ontology of technical systems is still
in a rather poor condition. A more general subject, the ontology of artifacts,
is, however, a new developing discipline. The first book in this subject
was published by Dipert 1993; since its main focus lies on works of art,
complex technical systems are rather neglected.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Peter Simons and Charles Dement (1996),
in contrast, deal with artifacts by analyzing systems such as airplanes.
In their paper they present a mereological approach, in which the concept
of a component is defined. They show that different kinds of components
have to be distinguished, assembly and disassembly components, for instance,
or functional, design and maintenance components. These components are
obviously of practical relevance, as is shown by the fact that the manufacturing
industry itself has developed a device for representing the mereology of
complex technical systems, the so called 'bills of material' (boms). Although
the mereological approach appears to be very fruitful, it cannot, however,
grasp a very important characteristic of complex technical systems, their
<I>multidimensionality</I>.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The present paper deals with this phenomenon,
concentrating on complex artifacts such as telemedical systems. In the
first section the need for a multidimensional ontology is pointed out.
The second paragraph presents the concept of a multidimensional ontology
by discussing problems of Aristotelian ontology and improvements suggested
by Franz Brentano. In the third paragraph a multidimensional ontology for
complex technical systems is suggested</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1 <I>The problem: a multidimensional ontology
for complex artifacts</I></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The complexity of an ontology for artifacts
such as technical systems can best be exposed by looking at the process
of their development. Consider, for instance, a group of scientists trying
to develop a telemedical system. Such a system is designed to improve the
medical service in regions which cannot afford expensive medical systems.
The telemedical sytem connects medical doctors in this location with well-equiped
specialists who are possibly hundreds of miles away. A central problem
of the developmental process will be the integration of the different perspectives
of the developers. Thus the medical doctors, who will use the system, will
talk about things such as x-ray photographs and other media for diagnosis.
The computer scientists who have to develop the computer programs involved
in such systems concentrate on the information processing necessary to
make the whole system work. They know nothing about the medical apparatus
their colleagues are talking about. The same is true of the engineers who
have to maintain the system once it is in operation. But these are not
the only perspectives which are relevant for the development of such a
complex system. In addition to the practitioners who will directly work
with the system or construct it, there are aspects such as data protection
or ecology which have to be taken into account. And one should not forget
that the whole project is also an economic entreprise, which has to be
managed and to turn a profit. Thus the problem of integrating a multiplicity
of perspectives arises.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the first glance it might seem as if
this were merely a practical matter since the different perspectives are
consequences of the fact that the system is located in different pragmatic
contexts. But although a pragmatic approach may describe the differences
pretty well, it cannot grasp the fact that the developers intend to refer
to one and the same thing. But the mere intention is not enough, since
the system has to be developed. This is not a trivial problem. Thus it
may well be that the developers do not talk about the same system. This
is, for instance, the case if the medical users ask for facilities which
cannot be realized in the present state of the technical arts or if economical
and technical requirements are incompatible. We see that the developers
have to solve an ontological problem, the problem of making sure that they
are talking about one and the same system and that this system is a possible
entity. The task of developing a complex technical system involves the
tak of the unification of objects described from the different perspectives
of the different participants. The ontological problem of the unity of
an object arises.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The situation is, however, even more complicated.
Development is itself a process, in which the object changes. In the different
stages of this process the system is represented in the form of ideas,
prototypes, alpha-and beta-versions and so on. What we probably don't have
is a final version. Even the stage in which the developers can expect a
premium for their achievement, in the stage where the system actually runs,
improvements and adaptations for new requirements have to be made. Hardware
is exchanged, and new versions of programs have to be installed, for instance.
Thus we cannot talk about <I>the</I> system as an <I>end </I>product, since
it is always evolving in time. Even the destruction of the system is part
of this process. It results in the disassembly components (cf. Simons and
Dement 1996) which are for ecological and other reasons in need of a special
treatment. It is very important that during the different stages of development
every participant knows at which stage he is. What is necessary is an abstract
theoretical framework which takes into account the many facets of complex
technical systems. What we need is an ontology of artifacts.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How is such a framework possible? An important
hint is given by Aristotle. He deals with a problem which has some similarity
with the one just described. As Aristotle points out, we talk about things
and persons in very different ways. Of Socrates, for instance, we say that
he is a human being, that he is snub-nosed, that he is in the market place,
that he is bigger than Critias and so on. In every instance we are talking
about Socrates but in ways which seem to be incompatible with one another.
Being in the market and being snub-nosed are completely different things.
It was Aristotle's idea to make a taxonomy of the different ways we talk
about things. This taxonomy shall inform us of how it is possible to determine
the different ways in which we can say of a thing that it <I>is </I>something.
These are the <I>kategoremata</I>, the categories, the most general genera.
These categories are not only fundamental for logic, but are also central
for ontology.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The similarity to the problem outlined
abouve is obvious. In the case of the tele-medical system as in the case
of Socrates we talk about them in different ways, which cannot be reduced
to one another. The system described by the medical doctor <I>is </I>in
an analogous way different to the one described by the computer scientist
or the entrepreneur as the description of Socrates as being in the market
and as being snub-nosed. So what we need is a categorial system for complex
technical systems which enables us to distinguish the different ways we
can talk about them. We can expect from such a categorization a practical
advantage which is similar to that which is gained from the Aristotelian
one. Both categorisations can be used as a heuristic. So if we want to
give a complete description of a thing, according to Aristotle, we have
to make statements according to the different categories: what substance
it is, what quality it has, what activities and passions there are, what
temporal and locational determinations can be made, and so on. The same
useful procedure can be expected of a categorial system for complex artifacts.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2 <I>The concept of a multidimensional
ontology</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Before we return to technical artifacts
we have to consider traditional ontology. From this tradition we expect
further hints for our ontological project. Thus we use the philosophical
tradition as a heuristic. Moreover, we are interested in relating the ontology
of complex artifacts to the great metaphysical tradition. As philosophers
we are glad to support the man of action with theoretical tools, but we
are not really happy until we get new insights, until we understand, for
instance, why we need a multidimensional ontology.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The traditional ontology from Plato and
Aristotle is monodimensional. According to Aristotle, who dominated this
subject until our times, a thing is a unit of material and formal parts.
Whereas the formal parts determine what a thing is, the material part individuates
the thing. The formal parts of a thing, which are called its 'substantial
form', themselves constitute a hierarchy. Thus if something, is a dog this
substantial form can be specified by determining what kind of dog it is
- for example, a dachshound. On the other hand, there are genera of which
the dog is a species, namely animal and living thing. So. if one wants
to determine what kind of object one is examining, one has to determine
the species specialissima, that is the most specific substantial form.
In order to define this, one has to refer to its next genera and the specific
difference according to the traditional theory of definition which says:
<I>definitio fit per genus proximum et differentiam specificam</I>. So
if your determination gives the species specialissima, you implicitly refer
to the complete hierarchy up to the most general ontological category which
is the category of substance (<I>ousia</I>). Such an ontology I call monodimensional,
since there is exactly one line or dimension beginning with most general
and terminating in the most specific form which determines the object.
The species is not only partially but completely contained in its different
genera.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is, however, one great problem with
this ontology: it makes sense only if one accepts Aristotle's doctrine
of act and potency. Without this doctrine the notion of substantial form
is untenable, since there will be no sharp distinction of substance from
accidents. According to Aristotle, the substantial form of a human being
is the <I>nous</I>, the intellective soul, which supplies the human being
with the logos (<I>zoon logos echein</I>). One cannot, however, find this
logos in a new-born child, at least not a complete realization of it. Nevertheless
the child is a human being. For Aristotle this is not really a problem.
According to his doctrine the child already has thelogos. It is, however,
not yet actual but only potentially there. This is proved, according to
Aristotle, by the fact that in optimal circumstances the child will gain
the logos in its full form. This is not the result of mere education, since
the dog which always accomponies the child during his exercises will not
be educated. This must have a reason. And this reason is, according to
Aristotle, that the potential substantial form becomes actual in the process
of development.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The doctrine of act and potency is also
necessary for the Aristotelian doctrine of individuation. As already mentioned,
according to Aristotle a thing is composed out of form and matter. And
it is matter which individuates a thing. This can be made clear by considering
the most special species. You can specify a thing in as detailed a manner
as you like, but it will always remain possible that there are different
tokens of it. Thus the individuation must be made by something other than
form, and this job is done, according to Aristotle, by matter. But if a
thing consists of form <I>and</I> matter, why is it just one thing and
not a collective of two things, namely form and matter? Aristotle's answer
is again contained in his doctrine of act and potency, which allows the
concept of a perfect fusion of form and matter. Both are unseparable parts
which stand in an ontological relation: the matter functions as potency
- Aristotle even used the Greek term <I>hyle</I> as a synonym for <I>dynamis</I>,
the Greek term for potency. The substantial form, on the other hand, functions
as its act (or <I>entelecheia</I>). It makes the matter the thing it actually
is. Thus form and matter are one thing, just as a possible chair and the
actual chair are not a collective of two things but one thing, although
the actual thing has to be possible, in order to be actual.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Unfortunately, Aristotle's doctrine of
act and potency is not tenable. It presupposes, for instance, that a pure
form functions as a cause. This is, however, not in accordance with physics.
This deficiency was recognized also by Franz Brentano, who nevertheless
tried to reestablish a metaphysics in Aristotelian style. He tried to establish
an Aristotelian ontology without the doctrine of act and potency. Obviously,
the abandonment of this doctrine makes a new concept of substance necessary.
Such a concept is suggested by Brentano in his later writings which have
been (not very happily) characterized as 'reistic'. In these writings Brentano
points out that Aristotle was wrong to advance his monodimensional ontology
described above. The specific differences are not, as Aristotle taught,
subordinated under one category or, as Brentano calls it, they are not
<I>homostoichetisch</I> (or <I>monostoichetisch</I>) (from Greek <I>stoichos</I>,
line, order). Brentano gives the following example. Consider a red point
at location <I>L</I> and another point with the same quality at location
<I>O</I>. The two points are not identical, and this makes evident, according
to Brentano, that the location is a substantial difference, since there
is no other respect in which these two points differ. On the other hand,
the point would be a different one if it had another color (quality). Thus
the location cannot be the only specific difference of the point. The color
of the point or, more general, its quality belongs to its specific difference,
too. But quality and location are different ways to classify a thing, or,
in the language of Aristotle, quality and location are different categories
which are conceived by him as the most general genera. According to Brentano,
there are different kinds of substantial differences which cannot overlap.
Brentano calls his doctrine that there are different lines of substantial
differences subordinated under different general genera <I>heterostoichetisch</I>
(or <I>pleiostoichetisch</I>). This is an important deviation from Aristotle.
It makes the doctrine of act and potency spurious. For things, which are
subject to outer perception, the distinction between subject and accident
is given up. Quality, which is traditionally regarded as the prototypical
accident, is 'sucked up' by the substance: it becomes a substantial difference.
Thus there is no need to distinguish between substantial and accidental
forms any longer, so that the doctrine of act and potency loses one of
its main jobs.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But also the other main function of the
doctrine of act and potency, its role in a theory of individuation, becomes
useless. Brentano is not in need any longer of matter as a principal of
individuation. Since there is more than one line of substantial difference,
these lines themselves can individuate a thing. Matter and therefore hylomorphism
no longer exist in this new ontology, the problem of unifying form and
matter has diasappeared.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This 'new ontology' outlined by Franz Brentano
is in fact already a version of a mulidimensional ontology projected here.
As we have seen, there are, according to Brentano, two lines of classification
(of <I>stoichoi</I>) which are relevant for things given in outer experience,
namely location and quality. One can represent this by building a Cartesian
product, that is, by using the twodimensional system with which we are
familiar from geometry. What results, however, is a qualitative and not
a quantitative space. The possible things can be mapped on a plane in which
each point is determined by its position on a quality axis <I>and </I>on
a location axis. And each thing can be identified by representing its location
on the quality axis and on the location axis. This yields a two-dimensional
ontology. But, depending on the kind of being we are dealing with, higher
dimensional ontologies are necessary. This is the essence of Brentano's
later ontology.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3 <I>A multidimensional ontology for complex
technical systems</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The questions arises what are the <I>categorial
</I>or <I>ontological dimensions,</I> as I call them, for technical systems.
A first dimension is the dimension of the different perspectives as described
in the first paragraph. In this line we have the telemedical system under
the descriptions of the medical doctors, of the computer scientists, the
engineers, the entrepreneurs and so on. I call this the <I>cognitive dimension</I>
since it is constituted by different cognitive acts in which the system
is <I>conceived</I> in different ways.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In each conception the system can be described
under different <I>formal</I> concepts, such as consistency, reliability,
information, part, and so on. The point is that there is not only one question
of consistency, reliability and so on, but as many as there are cognitive
perspectives. In the case of the medical doctor reliabiliy refers primarily
to the diagnostic procedure, in the case of the computer scientist it refers
to a quality of the computer programs, and in the case of the engineer
the construction of the hardware is in question. I call this the <I>formal
ontological dimension</I>.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I mentioned already that a technical system
evolves in time, that there are stages in which the system exists in the
form of a mere idea, of protototypes, of alpha- and beta-versions and so
on. At each stage you have different cognitive perspectives as well as
the fomal ontological dimension. This yields a third dimension, which I
dub the <I>progressive dimension.</I></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But this is not yet the whole story of
complex artifacts. If you have realized that such a system is a temporal
object evolving in time, you will see that there is no straight progression
but a quite complicated process, in which there are deadlocks, corrections,
new starts with new strategies, recourses to strategies which one had already
given up and so on. This dimension, which I call <I>evolutionary dimension</I>,
is of greatest practical importance since it mirrors the interactions which
have taken place between the participants. The medical doctor, for instance,
tells the computer scientist what he wants the system to do. The computer
scientist, in turn, translates this into his computer programming language
and makes a suggestion. Confronted with this proposal, the medical doctor
may realize that he has not been properly understood or that his own ideas
have not been clear enough. Thus he rejects the proposal of the computer
scientist; he makes a more precise description of the requirements and
gives new specifications. This in turn leads to another proposal of the
computer scientist and so on. The specifications of the medical doctor
are part of the ontology. They form a certain area in the ontological space
of the system: they can be related to a viewpoint of the cognitive dimension,
to the concepts of the formal ontological dimension and to a certain stage
in the progressive dimension. The same is true of all the proposals of
the computer scientist. Thus is mapped the cooperation which takes place
in the developmental process.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Whether we can manage with these four dimensions
is an empirical question. What we are offering is an ontology which calls
for an application. One should, however, realize that the four-dimensional
ontology here suggested is only a very abstract framework. In this respect
it is similar to Aristotle's theory of categorization. For each system
one has to determine the specific concepts which are relevant for it. A
category such as quality is specified in regard to a sound in different
ways than to a visible thing. In the same way the viewpoints relevant for
a telemedical system are different to the viewpoints which one has to distinguish
in dealing with a transport system.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such an ontology is certainly of great
philosophical relevance, since it makes clear that we need a new categorial
system in dealing with complex technical systems and, more generally, complex
artifacts. A philosophy of technology, for instance, will certainly fail
if it describes its subject in terms of a thing ontology, or with the help
of concepts which are derived from the consideration of tools like hammers.
In contrast to the hammer a complex technical system is essentially a multisubjective
object, insofar as it is constituted by different cognitive perspectives,
which are not necessary in the case of a hammer. Moreover it is essentially
a temporal object, in a sense in which an object falling under the traditional
category of thing is not.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One may, perhaps, object that we need the
concept of a thing for the naive physics project. It is true that the category
of a thing is central there. And a thing has always many features or accidents
(cf. Herbart) But as philosophers we need not only naive but also more
sophisticated ('philosophical') ontologies. The multidimensional ontology
can deal with substance/accident. In the case of a hammer, for instance,
we can normally neglect the evolutionary dimension. The progressive dimension
is radically reduced, only two stages are considered, namely the stage
of development and the stage in which there is the working hammer. And
of course, only this last stage is regarded as relevant (at least for people
who are not tool makers). A similar reduction takes place in the first
dimension, in which only one perspective is taken into account, that of
the hammering person. If one puts 'Quality' and 'Reliability' on the formal-ontological
dimension, then this dimension is needed too. A hammer can then be described
as a non-temporal, mono-subjective (in contrast to multi-subjective) thing
with many accidents. In other words, the substance/accident ontology can
be integrated into the multidimensional ontology. The substance-accident
ontology can be conceived as a derived, non-basic ontology.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Also Simons' and Dement's mereological
approach sketched above can be dealt within the multi-dimensional approach.
'Part' is a formal-ontological concept; it is for their approach the only
concept in the formal-ontological dimension. But Simons and Dement take
different pespectives of the cognitive dimension into account. This results
in different 'kinds' of components (parts). The multi-dimensional ontology
can, moreover, be used as a heuristic to improve the mereological approach.
It is quite clear from the structure of the multi-dimensional framework,
that in the case of the telemedical system there must also be components
in the perspective of the medical doctors, and in the perspective of the
computer scientist. In the first perspective there are entities such as
x-ray photographs, in the latter different programs and subroutines. The
multi-dimensional ontology is also of great practical relevance. It can
be used, for instance, as a heuristic in the development of such a system.
It is, actually, inspired by a developmental model suggested by the computer
scientist Bernd Mahr at the Technical University Berlin, which in turn
refers to models like the ISO standard ODP (Open Distributed Processing).
It enables the developers to ask relevant questions, insofar a it helps
to dissect a complex problem into more specific ones. And more importantly,
it improves the cooperation of the participants belonging to a variety
of disciplines and pursuing different interests. Thus, we can put straight
Nietzsche, who tried to philosophize with a hammer, namely by developing
technical systems with Aristotle and Brentano.</FONT>

to Aristotle there are also other categories than the category of substance,
as, for instance, the category of quality, quantity, action, passion, relation.
They are, however, not of equival value. In contrast to the other categories,
substantial forms have a causal power. Therefore science deals only with
substances but not with accidents, as Aristotle points out.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_2_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. <SUP>.</SUP>
</FONT>Unfortunately, this point has completely escaped the notice of philosophers
dealing with the later work of Brentano. The focus is, rather, on Brentano's
new interpretation of accidence and substance (e. g. Chisholm, 1978, or
Smith, 1994, chap. 3). According to Brentano, examples for accidents can
only be found in inner perception. Only in respect to the soul can we speak
of accidents, which mean that which intentionally inexists, the intentional
content. Brentano's retaining to the ontology of substance and accident
in respect to the soul, which he had actually overcome by his multidimensional
ontology presented in his later writings, can only be explained by his
theological motivations. He wants to retain the soul as a stable entity
which can have different 'modifications' without a substantial change.
But for this task he needs the old category of a substance. In all areas
which are relevant for naive physics, we don't need, however, the concept
of substance and accident. Thus one can claim that the importance of Brentano's
later ontology consists in the fact that he gets completely rid of the
substance - accidence - distinction for ordinary things, like stones, tables
and colored points.</FONT></UL>
