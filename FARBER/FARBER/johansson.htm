<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle's Monadological Construction of Social Reality</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Searle's analysis of collective intentions,
such intentions are not in any literal sense shared by the persons who
make up the collective. Therefore, an explicit I-intention ('I am A-ing')
can be regarded as a <I>single token </I>framed and executed by "the I"
in question, but an explicit We-intention ( 'We are A-ing') cannot similarly
be regarded as a single token jointly framed and executed by "the We" in
question. This consequence has been noted and criticized by J.D. Velleman
in a recent article.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP> My point here will
be, that in order to see what really is at stake we have to dig much deeper
than Velleman does in his article. In my view, the existence of jointly
framed single <I>tokens </I>of collective prior intentions ('We intend
to A'), as well as of collective intentions in action ('We are A-ing'),
can be defended only within a philosophical framework of direct realism.
But that belongs to the end of this paper. I will start by reminding the
reader of some of Searle's views.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>1. Are Intentional states
in the head?</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>A persistent theme in Searle's
writings from <I>Intentionality</I> onwards, is the view that mental states,
nonintentional as well as Intentional, exist in brains. Here are some quotations
ranging from 1983 to 1997; the italicizations are Searle's:</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>… mental states are both
<I>caused</I> <I>by</I> the operation of the brain and <I>realized in</I>
the structure of the brain (and the rest of the nervous system).<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Pains and other mental
phenomena just are features of the brain (and perhaps the rest of the central
nervous system).</I><SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Consciousness, in short,
is a biological feature of human and certain animal brains. It is caused
by neurobiological processes and is as much a part of the natural biological
order as any other biological features such as photosynthesis, digestion,
or mitosis.</I><SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It is indeed the case that
all my mental life is inside my brain, and all your mental life is inside
your brain, and so on for everybody else.<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Collective intentionality
is a primitive notion in the sense that it does not reduce to individual
intentionality. This is consistent with methodological individualism because
collective intentionality exists entirely in the heads of individual agents.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle argues philosophically
that mental states are non-reducible, but he presents his view that mental
states <I>exist entirely in our heads</I><SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP>as
something which is in no real need of <I>philosophical </I>comment. He
seems to think that science has answered the latter question. In my view,
however, some philosophy is needed here, too. From Descartes and onwards
there has, among ontologists, been great consensus to the effect that matter
(if it exists) exists in both time and space, but that mental phenomena
lack spatial extension and exist only in time (if time and space exist).
Any consistent biological naturalism which contains a realist view of mental
states has to deny this old assumption, and Searle is consistent. According
to him, mental phenomena are spatially located, and located in the brain.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>For every entity which exists
in space one can ask, literally, what its spatial extension is. Searle
has to face this question in relation to mental states. And implicitly
he has answered it. The quotations above afford us with his answer for
the upper limit: <I>The spatial extension of mental phenomena does not
exceed that of the brain</I>. Also, at least once, Searle has stated a
lower limit for mental spatial extension: <I>Single synapses, receptors
and neurons are too small to have mental features</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It may, for good phenomenological
reasons, be claimed that many mental states lack well-defined spatial locations
since they lack distinct boundaries. Searle has commented upon the view
which adds that if mental states lack such boundaries they cannot exist
in space. His primary answer is that "If we had perfect knowledge of how
the brain produced, for example, thirst or visual experiences, we would
have no hesitation in assigning these experiences location in the brain".<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP>
But then he says that <I>even if </I>mental states lack well-defined borders,
they can exist as "global features of the brain or of some large brain
area such as the cortex", and "they would still be treated as global features
of a spatial entity, viz., the <I>brain</I> or some brain area such as
the <I>cortex</I>."<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP> As far as I can
see, Searle has committed himself to the following three views:</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>(a) All mental states are
<I>localized</I> in the brain;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>(b) the <I>spatial extension
</I>of mental states is not larger than the brain and not smaller than
single neurons;</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>(c) we do not know at the
moment whether or not mental states have well-defined <I>spatial borders</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle's views on the spatial
localization and the spatial extension of mental states have repercussions
for other areas in his ontology. In particular, they affect his analysis
of Intentional states. I will present the point I want to make by means
of a constructed dialogue between an interrogator (i.e. me) and Searle
(i.e. my Searle reception).</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>First question</I>: How
do my mental phenomena, which are located in my brain, manage to relate
to the world outside my brain?</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: By means
of Intentionality, as in thinking of a specific material thing or in perceiving
it.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Second question</I>:
What kind of structure is at work when I am thinking of my old father who
is about six hundred miles away?</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: In the <B>psychological
mode </B>of thinking you <B>represent </B>your father by means of an <B>Intentional
content</B>, and Intentional states, like this act of thinking, have <B>conditions
of satisfaction </B>(=c.o.s.). All representations are unities of a psychological
mode and an Intentional content; unities which have conditions of satisfaction.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Third question</I>: Am
I then in some kind of spatial contact with my father?</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: No, you cannot
possibly be. You and your brain are here, but your father is far away.
However, you are by means of your mental and Intentional act directed at
your father. An Intentional state has <I>two </I>kinds of conditions of
satisfaction: one of them, the <B>requirement c.o.s.</B> (i.e. the meaning
of your thought), is spatially internal to your thought, whereas the other,
the <B>required c.o.s.</B> (i.e. your father), is spatially external to
your thought.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP> We all know that we can
think of persons and things which exist outside our thoughts and outside
our brain.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Fourth question</I>: When
you and I are thinking of the same thing, what do we share?</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: Nothing spatially,
but we are directed at the same thing. For some reasons we happen to think
of the same thing at the same time.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Fifth question</I>: What
kind of structure is at work when I am visiting my father and I perceive
him in front of me?</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: In the <B>psychological
mode </B>of perceiving, your father is <B>represented </B>by means of an
<B>Intentional content</B>. Representations, however, may differ in kind,
and this kind of representation, which contains visual experiences, had
better be called '<B>presentation</B>'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP>
Since presentations constitute a species of <I>re</I>presentation, they
are unities of a psychological mode and an Intentional content, and they
have conditions of satisfaction. In this respect there is no difference
between thinking and perceiving.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Sixth question</I>: Do
I then in this presentation have <I>direct access </I>to my father?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: Yes, you have.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Seventh question</I>:
Do you mean that I am in some kind of spatial contact with him?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: No, you cannot
possibly be. Like all your mental states and events, this perception of
yours is located in your brain. And, of course, your brain is spatially
distinct from your father. But you are directed at your father. Furthermore,
you are directed at your father as being the cause of your perception of
him. Nothing of the sort appears in thinking. Presentational Intentionality
is causally self-referential. You may also put it like this: In veridical
perception the <B>required c.o.s.</B>, which are spatially external to
the perception,<B> </B>cause the Intentional state (the perception) with
its <B>requirement c.o.s.</B>, which are spatially internal to it. In your
case, your father, who is external to your brain, causes your visual experiences,
which are internal to your brain.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Eighth question</I>: So,
you make a difference between having <I>direct access</I><SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP><I>
</I>and <I>being in some kind of spatial contact</I>?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: Yes.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Ninth question</I>: Is
then no human mind in any kind of spatial contact with any other mind or
with things outside the brain in which it is located?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle: No.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Tenth question</I>: Do
you believe in any kind of purely mental contact and/or action between
mental phenomena at a distance?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle: No.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Eleventh question</I>:
When you say that a certain perceiver has direct access to an object, you
then only mean that the perceiver perceives an Intentional object which
is a main and immediate cause of his perception. Is that right?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: Yes.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Twelfth question</I>:
When two persons, P and Q, look at each other, the following four statements
are all true descriptions of the situation: 1) the <B>mental event </B>which
is P's look of Q is wholly located in the brain of P, and the mental event
which is Q's look of P is wholly located in the brain of Q; 2) the <B>Intentional
object</B><SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP><B> </B>of P's look is outside
the brain of P, and the Intentional object of Q's look is outside the brain
of Q; 3) P and Q have <B>direct access </B>to each other; 4) P and Q are
not in any kind of <B>spatial contact</B>. Have I understood your position?</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Searle</I>: Yes.</FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>2. Leibniz and Searle</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Leibniz occurs a couple of
times in Searle's writings. In <I>Speech Acts</I>,<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP>
Leibniz is mentioned when Searle is discussing substitution <I>salva veritate</I>;
in <I>Intentionality</I><SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP> and in <I>Minds,
Brains and Science</I>,<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP> Leibniz is
used as a foil for Searle's own view that mental states can have physical
causes. Leibniz believed that mental states can only be caused by other
mental states. However, in spite of this difference, there is in another
respect an astonishing similarity between Searle and Leibniz.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Leibniz, the
world (except God) is made up of indivisible, but nevertheless complex,
self-sufficient units which he called monads. Each monad is a kind of mental
power point which produces perceptions, imaginations, thoughts, and other
mental phenomena. No monad, however, can be part of, or be in contact with,
any other monad. Every monad is wholly enclosed within itself. Since some
of the monads correspond to what we usually think of as persons, Leibniz
might be taken to imply that our common-sense view that we all live in
and have knowledge of a <I>common </I>world, is in every respect mistaken.
But that is a false interpretation. He deflected epistemological solipsism
by his famous thesis that there exists a Pre-Established Harmony between
the monads. There is a law to the effect that everything that happens in
one monad is in some way mirrored in all the others.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>According to my description
of Searle's ontology, our minds come out just as self-enclosed in his ontology
as they do in Leibniz'. Since minds are spatially enclosed in brains and
two brains cannot be in the same place neither can two minds.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle has explicitly said
that he thinks that his account of visual perception is "a version of 'naive'
(direct, common sense) realism",<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP> but
in my view this claim cannot be justified. In the unreflective moments
of my life I take myself in veridical perception to be in direct contact
with things which exist <I>outside</I> myself. Unreflectively I assume
that I am in <I>some kind</I> of spatial contact with an outside world,
not with something which like a headache is situated in my head. And I
do not think that this is a view which is peculiar to me. It is not unreflective
common-sense, but philosophical <I>prima facie</I> interpretations of modern
science which, so to speak, have stuck the whole perceived world up into
our brain.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When, to take another example,
I pull my fingers through my hair and I feel that my fingers are touching
the <I>outside </I>of my head, this head-being-touched-on-perception is
in Searle's view a mental phenomenon which exists <I>inside</I> my material
head. Likewise, all my perceptions of seemingly outer things are merely
phenomena situated in my brain.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle's conflict with common-sense
has at least one terminological consequence. He has to twist the ordinary
concept of presentation. Normally, we talk of veridical perceptions as
presentations <I>in contrast to</I> representations like thoughts and pictures.
Something cannot be <I>both</I> a presentation and a <I>re</I>presentation.
But that is what happens in Searle's conceptual apparatus. In Searle's
vocabulary, veridical perceptions are both presentations and representations
(see the answer to the fifth question in the dialogue in section one).</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Naive realism is not monadological,
but Searle's ontology is. They are in conflict. And this conflict does
not disappear when we move from veridical perception of things to veridical
perception of other persons and of social reality. On the contrary, it
becomes even more challenging. As a philosopher I can, if I try really
hard, accept that I may be wholly wrong when I think that I am directly
seeing and touching, say, a wall which I am painting. But I find it almost
impossible to think that I have neither in visual nor in tactual perception
ever been in direct contact with any of the persons that I like. Applied
to kissings and other nice things done intentionally together with a beloved
one, Searle's analysis means the following. In such situations one's material
body is in contact with one's beloved's body, but one's perceptions are
wholly in one's head, and the beloved's perceptions are wholly in the beloved's
head. Monadological thinking looks very strange when applied to human relations.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Leibniz, the
whole world is scattered in a plurality of monads. According to Searle,
the whole social world is scattered in a plurality of brains. Since Searle
takes social reality to be observer-relative, he has to regard it the same
way he regards all other mental phenomena. In particular, Searle's analysis
means that a We-intention of P and Q, 'We are A-ing', can only exist as
scattered in the two brains of P and Q. Such a We-intention necessarily
consists of two tokens of the same type. Therefore, We-intentions cannot
like I-intentions possibly be token-reflexive. This seems to me to be a
rather awkward consequence for Searle, who stresses that I-intentions and
We-intentions semantically are on a par with each other. He regards them
as two different and equally primitive kinds of biological phenomena, none
of which can be reduced to the other.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>3. To think with Searle
against Searle</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle's view that all Intentional
states are in our heads leads him inevitably to a monadological construction
of social reality. And this is not "ordinary" social reality. In order
to get a common-sense conception of social reality, one needs a common-sensical
conception of veridical perception, i.e. one needs direct realism. However,
that position is not as far away from Searle's actual analysis of mind
as it may seem. It is important to remember that Searle does not regard
consciousness as a "stuff". There is according to Searle no spiritual substance
which is mixed with, blended with, dissolved in, or juxtaposed with parts
of the brain. Mental states are macro level <I>properties </I>of physical
systems.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It seems to me as if Searle
has taken it for granted, that the basic questions about the spatial location
and the spatial extension of mental states are purely scientific questions.
Questions which perceptual psychology and the neurobiological sciences
have already answered with an "in the brain". But notice: <I>If Searle
drops "the-mind-in-the-brain" thesis, then nothing else in his general
ontology contradicts the view that a visual veridical perception is a kind
of property, a mental feature, whose spatial extension covers the whole
physical system consisting of the perceiving brain, the perceived object,
and the space in-between them</I>.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If one's ontology says that
mental phenomena are extended in space, one needs <I>specific </I>reasons
in order to defend the view that the mental phenomena of human beings are
always spatially confined within the brain. Even if dreams and hallucinations
are wholly located in the brain, other mental phenomena, like veridical
perceptions, may perhaps have a much larger spatial extension.<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21)</A></SUP>
Perhaps, dreams and hallucinations should be seen as a mind-<I>body</I>
problem, but veridical perception as more broadly a mind-<I>nature</I>
problem. Veridical seeing is perhaps a mental property which emerges on
and is spatially extended over the whole system of perceiver, perceived,
and the perceptual causal chain. Such an hypothesis throws new light on
the classical arguments from illusion.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If we assume that veridical
seeing is extended from the perceiver to the perceived, but that a corresponding
hallucination is spatially confined to the brain, then it suddenly seems
natural to say that the physical causes of a hallucination are wholly situated
within the brain, whereas the physical causes of a veridical perception
are spread out from the perceiver to the perceived. In arguments from illusion
against direct realism, it is taken for granted that hallucinations and
veridical perceptions can be qualitatively identical. But if mental phenomena
are ascribed spatial extension, this seemingly innocent presupposition
puts the cart before the horse. If the spatial extensions of hallucinations
and veridical perceptions are different, then hallucinations and veridical
perceptions cannot <I>be </I>qualitatively identical although they can
<I>appear</I> to be qualitatively identical!<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP>
Put differently: If direct realism is false their extensions are the same,
but if direct realism is true their extensions are different.</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The task here, however, is
not to discuss direct realism,<SUP><A HREF="#N_23_">(23)</A></SUP> but
to highlight Searle's thinking. My main conclusion is that Searle's radical
ontological claim that mental states have spatial extension opens up uninvestigated
philosophical opportunities. Some of these opportunities point towards
direct realism rather than towards a monadology. Pursuing them may take
us towards a non-monadological construction of social reality. In such
a reality we can directly perceive each other, and the existence of such
mutual perceptions can, I think, help us to explain how the phrase 'We
intend' can be token-reflexive.</FONT></FONT>
