<P>Economists speak of macroeconomic phenomena such as inflation, unemployment,
and growth as existing conditions in our social reality. These conditions
describe existing states of affairs in the world which affect choice. To
the average individual, for example, such conditions are facts which will
influence his saving and spending decisions. When making economic decisions,
then, individuals view the world as composed of economic facts. It is not
that the individual, <I>qua</I> economic agent, shapes the world in a particular
way. Tables and chairs, mountains and trees, minerals and rain, dogs and
cats -- all real things in the world remain the same, and as clearly apprehensible
to him as these real things are when he is not acting as an economic agent.
However, there is a difference in how the individual, <I>qua</I> economic
agent, divides the reality he perceives. He orders things in the world
according to their role in the economic conditions which affect his plans.
As a result, a thing of natural beauty such as a tree may acquire an economic
character if he perceives a causal connection between the tree and his
need for shelter. The individual thus perceives the tree not just as a
gift of nature, or a beautiful thing, or as an instance of a woody perennial
plant, but also as an intermediate good, a means for the fulfillment of
a plan to build a house.

<P>Similarly, all things in the world -- both artifacts and naturally existing
things -- are viewed by the economic agent as constituents of a reality
divided by and articulated through economic considerations. All phenomena
which economists speak of constitute a reality viewed through the lenses
of the economic actor. The elements of such phenomena are not describable
by the language of physics alone since such a description would lack the
social dimension of physical things, such as the tree <I>qua</I> construction
material. Instead, mainstream economists refer to the 'economic microfoundations'
of such phenomena which are constituted by elements such as firms, consumers,
and markets. But these elements of macroeconomic phenomena presuppose other,
more elementary, economic objects. For example, a 'consumer' presupposes
goods and a market, and 'firms' presuppose the production of a good, the
demand for a good, and a labor market, and 'market' presupposes an existing
notion of exchange. There are, then, even more fundamental elements in
economic phenomena to which we may refer as economic objects.

<P>The relevant question here is this: what makes any one thing an economic
object? Based on the discussion above, the quick and easy answer is that
an economic object is a product of beliefs and physical things. However,
this answer requires further examination. The purpose of this paper is
to present an ontology of economic objects as a first attempt to lay the
groundwork for a complete description of the aspect of social reality we
shall call economic reality. Throughout the development of the body of
economic theory, there has been a piecemeal approach to the description
of economic objects such as money, price, and others. With only one exception,
no single economist has contributed a general theory of economics containing
an exact description of all economic objects which are part of its theoretical
framework. This exceptional contribution was provided by Carl Menger in
his <U>Principles of Economics</U>, first published in 1871. Central to
Menger's general theory is a description of laws governing six economic
objects: economic goods, commodity, money, value, price, and exchange.
The ontology of economic objects in this paper will be founded on Menger's
theoretical framework, although I include some extended philosophical analysis
as well as considerations from the perspective of mainstream economics.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>
Menger's description is significant because it offers the conditions for
settling objectively whether the views individuals have about an instance
of a given category of economic objects indeed correspond to that category.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Let us, then, proceed by considering once again our earlier
question: what makes any one thing an economic object? According to Menger,
the answer is a combination of two things. First, the views we hold about
things <I>qua</I> economic objects. Second, the laws describing the categories
to which such economic objects belong. The first is an epistemic point
which we shall clarify next. The second is part of the larger ontological
task of this paper which we shall resume once we have disposed of the first.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>An Epistemic Clarification</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Knowledge and beliefs play an important role in social
phenomena. In economic judgments, the views that individuals hold about
things <I>qua</I> economic objects are central to the analysis. For example,
a dollar bill is treated as money because of people's beliefs that it is
a token of a universal medium of exchange.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>
Such beliefs about dollar bills or any other unit of accepted currency
are <U>subjective</U> because there is no single physical property that
is common to all the members of the class of economic objects we call money.
In other words, money is not reducible to a physical description of the
paper, metal, plastic, or electronic components which comprise the various
kinds of money we recognize as, and indeed call, money.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Nevertheless, we must also consider that people are frequently
mistaken in their beliefs. The case of counterfeit money presents a fitting
example in which individuals who accept counterfeit money in their transactions
are mistaken in their views about those tokens they take to be genuine
instances of the type-category money. However, an economic object is not
arbitrarily designated to be a token instance of a type-category by our
merely believing it to be so. Although economic judgments are subjective,
they are not arbitrary. There are, as we shall see, certain conditions
or, as Menger calls them, exact laws for each economic category such that
the truth or falsity of a belief about an economic object can be objectively
settled.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>But I am getting ahead of the ontological story about
money. The chief point that I would like to drive home in this epistemic
clarification is that economic objects are not reducible to either beliefs
or to some intrinsic property of things. Economic objects, as social phenomena,
are the product of beliefs and objective properties of things, some of
which are physical facts and others are social facts. A coin, for example,
has the objective property of the metal it is made of. The social fact
is that a piece of circularly shaped metal with a fixed value which issued
by a government is treated as money. Such social facts arise in spontaneous
social activity. The ensuing ontological description, then, will include
both the subjective and objective factors in economic phenomena. In what
follows, I shall describe Menger's six categories of economic objects:
good, commodity, money, value, price, and exchange.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Category 'Economic Good'</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>An economic good exists as such by virtue of putative
features that an individual attaches to a thing in relation to an end the
individual has in mind. With this end in mind, the thing is either the
means or the end itself. In either case, the thing thus acquires what Menger
calls a goods-character. Hence, the goods-character of a thing cannot be
instantiated in the thing apart from a judging mind. The following conditions
describe the subject-dependent mode of existence of an economic good:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1. A judging subject must perceive a thing as scarce,
relative to this total supply of the thing.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The thing must be evaluated in relation to a need known
to the judging subject as more urgent than any other need. Because less
urgent needs might have to be sacrificed, an evaluation of means ensues
in order that the subject can make the most efficient allocation of resources
to acquire the thing and thus maximize his total utility.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The thing acquires an importance to the judging subject
in relation to this unmet need or want, since the judging subject perceives
a causal connection between the thing and the fulfillment of an end. It
is with the association of the thing to the judging subject's expectations
to the thing that the thing acquires the putative feature of an economic
good.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Not least in importance is the judging subject's belief
that he has a feasible command of the thing sufficient to be able to direct
it to the satisfaction of an end. If the judging subject does not hold
this belief because, for example, his resources are insufficient to acquire
the thing, then the thing does not acquire a goods-character. Neoclassical
economists would characterize this point by saying that the thing does
not enter into the individual's utility curve.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Category 'Commodity'</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As we have seen above, a thing is a good if an agent perceives
it to be in direct connection with the fulfillment of a want or need. This
is, however, only one side of the coin for, on the other side, a thing
must also be supplied in order for it to be acquired. This other side of
the coin is what describes the commodity-character of a thing: its availability
for sale, exchange, or acquisition, regardless of its "tangibility, mobility,
or character" as either a consumption or a production good.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP>
The conditions for the commodity category of economic objects are as follows:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1. A thing intended for sale at a price agreed-upon between
buyer and seller.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2. A dependence relation of the thing for sale to the
seller of such a thing. This dependency relation is what gives rise to
the commodity-character of a thing.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The use of a commodity is not intended for consumption
but for sale or exchange. Once a commodity is purchased with the intention
of consumption, the commodity-character of the good ceases although its
goods-character does not.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4. The marketability of a commodity is limited to:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>a. Persons who perceive it as an economic good.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>b. Persons who are not prevented, legally, physically
or otherwise, from purchasing it.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>c. Persons who have knowledge of its availability for
purchase.<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Category 'Money'</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In the <U>Principles</U>, Menger describes the historical
emergence of money. For our purposes, the conditions described below apply
only to the mature concept of money: that which is considered a universal
medium of exchange as well as a commodity for storing exchangeable wealth.
Thus, the conditions for the money category of economic objects are:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1. The widespread acceptance of a medium of exchange --
i.e., a type-currency -- as money.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The marketability of a type-currency based on its widespread
acceptance.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The marketability of tokens corresponding to a type-currency
based on the widespread acceptance of the type-currency.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Legal orders which legitimize both type-currencies
as well as their corresponding tokens as:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>a. Universal substitutes in exchange.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>b. Commodities for storing exchangeable wealth.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5. The acceptance of the unit measures of a type-currency
-- i.e., its denominations -- as objective scales for assigning a price
to any commodity, including the exchange ratio with other type-currencies
<I>qua</I> commodities.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The case of counterfeit money presents an interesting
philosophical problem for it suggests that, if the existence of money is
dependent on people's beliefs, then error on the part of subjects who mistake
counterfeit money for actual money could not be discovered objectively
by means of facts. Let us, then, address this problem. In the presence
of counterfeit money, economic agents might be fooled by the token objects
they believe to be genuine members of the type-category money described
above. The error might be, in fact, passed inadvertently through several
exchanges with other individuals. But this error will not be a lasting
one unless the counterfeit money is stored under a mattress. In normal
circumstances, however, the discovery of error will occur quickly and systematically.
It will occur quickly because, given the velocity of the circulation of
money, it is unlikely that counterfeit money will not reach a bank sooner
rather than later. Private banks, as sellers of the commodity money, have
a vested interest in establishing security checks for the verification
of genuine tokens in their transactions. And the discovery of error will
occur systematically because the facts which will settle the truth or falsity
of the beliefs individuals have about token instances of money are established
by the legal orders which oversee the circulation of its currency.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The problem of error, then, is an epistemic problem of
the individual. Within a larger social framework, money has a structure
of social facts which settle objectively the truth or falsity of the individual's
beliefs about an instance of the type-category money. It is by virtue of
social facts that the type-category money has a mode of existence which
is not altered by any single individual's false beliefs. Accordingly, instances
of error in a judgment about a false token of the type-category money do
not alter the false token by arbitrarily instantiating in it the properties
of an actual token any more than the false token alters the type-category
itself. In our present nationalized monetary systems, the legal orders
are institutionalized central banks. They determine the kind of paper,
weight, texture, color and other secret security measures to prevent duplication.
Central banks have a vested interest in keeping counterfeit money out of
circulation because the national currency is also a commodity. As such,
consumer confidence in the stability and strength of a type-currency will
determine its demand in international money markets. Any rumor of counterfeit
money will seriously affect a currency's exchange value. The systematic
checks on the part of central banks are, therefore, rigorous in strong
currency systems. Since strong currencies are the only ones worth the trouble
of producing counterfeit tokens, the occurrence of counterfeit money is
rare. Moreover, private banking institutions which accept foreign currencies
follow the systematic controls established by the central bank of the currency's
origin since they, too, stand to lose by accepting counterfeit money. Successful
non-banking businesses, too, will adopt routine checking mechanisms in
their daily transactions for verifying the authenticity of certain denominations
most likely to be counterfeit in order to prevent losses. Hence, counterfeit
money will be most likely discovered even before it reaches a bank.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Category 'Value'</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Value is a thorny category because the term 'value' is
often used in conflicting ways. Most accounts of value, for example, attempt
to reduce it either to the mind or to some intrinsic property of things.
Of all theories of value, however, economic value theory stands out as
the most coherent theory, the episode of the labor theory of value notwithstanding.
Ever since the publication of Menger's <U>Principles</U>, economic value
has been described as subjective. Accordingly, the category of economic
value has the following conditions:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1. A significance attached to a good resulting from a
conceptualization of the good in terms of a desired end. Such a conceptualization
can be characterized as an <I>interested</I> evaluation since the agent
perceives a causal connection between the possession of the good and the
fulfillment of an end.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The recognition of a perceived utility stemming from
concrete quantities of a good in relation to an end.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The instantiation of the feature of scarcity in a good
resulting from the agent's perceived lack of concrete quantities of such
a good in relation to the fulfillment of his total utility.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4. A dependence relation between the assigned importance
to any one need or want and the relative importance of other needs or wants.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5. A dependence relation between the relative importance
of any need or want and the agent's overall degree of fullest satisfaction
expected.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>6. A dependence relation between the importance of higher-order
goods and the importance of first-order goods.<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>7. A dependence relation between the future value of things
and the present value of things.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>8. The nature of the significance attached to a good varies
according to the relation between wants and things. Hence, the putative
significance of a good in a judging subject's mind is transitory since
such significance arises and disappears as wants arise and disappear.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>9. The value of the <U>services</U> of particular goods
such as land, capital, and labor are subject to the same laws of value,
outlined above, as for any other economic good.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Category 'Price'</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Since price is attached to a commodity, many modern economists
refer to price as an <I>objective</I> measure of value. This is somewhat
misleading, however, because the <I>objectivity</I> to which they refer
is not a feature of price. It would be inconsistent to assert that price
is an objective measure since such an assertion would raise the following
question: Upon what facts is the objectivity of measurement grounded? Since
the value of a good is acquired from putative features attached to the
good by a judging subject, there cannot be any objective facts upon which
to establish the objectivity of price or its measurement. It is unclear
to what, then, objectivity is ascribed. One possibility is that objectivity
is predicated of number as an abstract entity. But this, surely, is not
what is meant.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A better interpretation of what modern economists mean
when they refer to price as an objective measure of value is that the discrete
succession of natural numbers gives rise to an objective criterion of identity
for each number in this succession. Let me briefly elaborate by means of
an illustration. Suppose that there are two groups of things in the world.
One group consists of pencils, and the other group consists of chairs.
By comparing each group based on a one-to-one correspondence between each
single element in the pencil group with one element in the chair group,
we may find that both groups are correlative in number. In other words,
in our example, there is an exact one-to-one correspondence with respect
to quantity between the elements of both groups. We could say, then, that
concrete reality grounds our concepts for numerical representation (e.g.,
two, three, etc.) of quantity identity in two distinct groups of things.
Insofar as mathematical beliefs concerning numerical quantities are about
representations (e.g., names, symbols, or utterances) in the form of one,
two, three, and so on, which can be said to be grounded on states of affairs
in the world that can be described in terms of numerical quantities, then
the theory of number must allow for a realist criterion of identity.<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP>
How else could mankind have developed mathematical formulations involving
numbers if representations of numerical magnitudes were to be conceptualized
differently by different people? And, more particularly, how could we have
developed any system of prices if any one individual could not grasp the
identity relation between the $5 price of good X and the $5 price of good
Y? That we are able to grasp identity relations in numerical quantities
speaks of the intelligibility of concrete reality. In this sense, then,
we can assert that the criterion of identity of discrete numerical magnitudes
is objective since its truth is settled by facts in the world.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The above explanation is not offered by neoclassical economists,
although it does not contradict neoclassical price theory. However, without
the above explanation, the mainstream characterization of price does not
appear to cohere with the theory of subjective value. For Menger, the above
explanation is unnecessary since he does not characterize price in the
same misleading language as that found in neoclassical theory. In fact
Menger anticipates this problem when he writes, "since prices are the only
phenomena of the process that are directly perceptible, since their magnitude
can be measured exactly, and since daily living brings them unceasingly
before our eyes, it [is] easy to commit the error of regarding the magnitude
of price as the essential feature of an exchange, and as a result of this
mistake, to commit the further error of regarding the quantities of goods
in an exchange as equivalents."<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP> Price,
then, is merely an objective magnitude of numerical value. But the putative
value of the commodity tagged at a particular price is not equivalent to
the price. The putative value is subjectively evaluated by the agent such
that, if he decides to purchase the good, he assigns a greater value to
the possession of the good in relation to the possession of the money he
is willing to give up in exchange, given alternative uses for that money.
Accordingly, the conditions for the price category of economic objects
are as follows:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Price is a numerical magnitude that can be measured
exactly and objectively.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The value of the discrete units of magnitude tend to
increase or decrease in an inverse relation to increases or decreases in
the supply of the good, <I>ceteris paribus</I>.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The value of the discrete units of magnitude tend to
increase or decrease in a direct relation to increases or decreases in
the demand of the good, <I>ceteris paribus</I>.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4. In the presence of competition, the price of a good
will tend to decrease since competition tends to increase the available
supply of goods to meet the demand.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5. A price agreed upon by a buyer reflects one objective
measure among a range of possible magnitudes at which the buyer might have
been willing to exchange.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Category 'Exchange'</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>All of the above categories come into definite relations
in the category of economic objects called <I>exchange</I>. Namely, an
individual will perceive a thing as a good if it will satisfy a need or
want. This evaluation results in the good acquiring a significance to the
individual which instantiates its economic value. Since the thing is perceived
as a good, then it is available as a commodity offered in exchange for
a price. The seller of the commodity also finds value in the exchange since
he attaches greater significance to the proceeds of the sale that in possessing
the commodity. The asking price for the commodity is an objective magnitude
which is expressed in terms of a quantity of money as the pecuniary term
of the transaction. As such, money is the medium for the exchange. The
exchange requires at least two participants (the seller of the commodity,
and an agent who perceives the commodity as a good), a thing (perceived
by the potential buyer as a good, and perceived by the seller as a commodity)
with an assigned price, and a monetary transaction. If an exchange between
two or more parties occurs, then the transaction is considered mutually
beneficial and the results more satisfactory than if the exchange had not
occurred. The conditions for the category exchange are as follows:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1. If two or more individuals contemplate a mutual transfer
of commodities such that they assess their needs to be better satisfied
with the transfer than it would be the case in the absence of such a transfer,
then an exchange between such individuals will occur.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The participants in the transaction have no legal,
physical, or mental obstacles preventing them from the determination of
the terms of the transaction such as the quantity of the commodity to be
transferred, the price of the commodity, the terms of payment, the time
and place for the transfer, etc.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The cause of the transfer is the willingness to satisfy
needs as completely as possible.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Each of the participants in the transfer must possess
either a definite quantity of a commodity or a definite quantity of money,
which has a smaller value to the respective party than what will be given
up in the transfer.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>5. All participants are willing to engage in the transfer
voluntarily.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Concluding Remarks</FONT></I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The above ontological description of economic phenomena
suggests the following conclusion: On the one hand, <U>an economic object
is a subjective entity</U> since its mode of existence depends on it being
perceived by agents as 'economic.' What 'economic' means is that the judgment
involves an evaluation directed at making a choice among known alternatives.
Every choice concerns some element of scarcity such as limited time, limited
productive resources, physical and intellectual limitations, levels of
satiation, and so on. Coping with scarcity is a fundamental feature of
the human condition which demands the allocation of means to meet ends.
Any activity of this nature is an economic activity and any thing evaluated
in such an activity acquires an economic character.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>On the other hand, <U>the judgment which the agent makes
regarding the economic object is subjective</U>. But its truth or falsity
<U>can</U> be settled objectively by the correspondence of the judgment
with facts about the object. Some of these facts are intrinsic properties
of the object. For example, suppose that I see red apples which, in my
judgment, appear luscious and sweet. Further suppose that I desire to possess
these apples in order to bake an apple pie. Owing to my judgment, the apples
acquire certain putative features which I see connected to the fulfillment
of my present need to eat a sweet and delicious apple pie. The actual fulfillment
of my expectations, however, will depend in part on the intrinsic properties
of the apples. If their red and luscious appearance does not correspond
to their actual state of ripeness, then my expectations will be proven
false when I eat a piece of sour apple pie if, for example, the apples
were artificially ripened so they look red and delicious but their chemical
composition has not yet reached the level of sweetness of ripe apples.
But these are not the only facts to consider in settling the truth or falsity
of my expectations about the apples. If, for example, the apples are in
a basket on my neighbor's yard but they are not for sale, then these apples
are not commodities. I could offer money to my neighbor to try to persuade
him to sell them to me but, if he does not accept the offer, there will
not be an exchange. Some of the facts, then, are physical facts and other
facts are social facts such as those involved in an act of exchange. Any
truth claims about my economic judgment are, then, objectively determinable
by means of all relevant facts.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The analysis we may advance, then, is this. There are
two senses of 'subjective' in economic phenomena.<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP>
On the one hand, there is an epistemic sense of the term <U>subjective</U>
that is embodied in economic judgments. On the other hand, there is an
ontological sense of the term <U>subjective</U> according to which what
is subjective are the things which are the target of economic judgments.
By means of economic judgments, putative features are attached to things
in connection with a want or need. These features -- e.g., scarcity, the
thing's significance in relation to a want or need, the causal connection
between the possession of the thing and the fulfillment of an end -- obtain,
in the thing, a goods-character. But this is not all. These two senses
of subjective are reconcilable with facts, both physical and social, if
and when the expectations correspond to these facts. The theory of truth
in this realist economic ontology is, then, one of correspondence. In other
words, what will instantiate truth in economic judgments is the correspondence
between expectations and their fulfillment in facts.</FONT>

the present mainstream in economics. His <U>Principles of Economics</U>
served as the foundation for the Austrian school of economics which, unlike
the neoclassical school, did not employ mathematics as its means of describing
economic phenomena. Much of neoclassical theory is, however, founded on
Menger's and other Austrian economists' contributions to economic theory.</FONT>

employ the term <I>utility</I> to denote preference for one good or bundle
of goods. A <I>utility curve</I> is a representation of the level of preference
of a bundle of goods. Suppose that the bundle of goods includes two goods,
and one of these is X and the other Y. The utility curve of such a bundle
of goods is assigned a numerical value by a utility function of the form
U = U (X,Y).</FONT>

explains the spontaneous organization of market places, fairs, or other
means for advertising the availability of goods for sale. See, Carl Menger,
<U>Principles of Economics</U>, pp. 248-250. It is erroneous to think that
needs for things are created by the advertising of commodities since the
concept of 'need' is a condition for the goods-character of a thing, but
not a condition the commodity-character of a thing. Accordingly, a commodity
does not produce a need but merely addresses an already existing need.</FONT>

In other words, Kant's conception of disinterestedness in the aesthetic
judgment of the beautiful is not merely the absence of desiring to possess
the thing of beauty. More importantly, Kant explains that the satisfaction
derived from the beautiful finds no grounds in the judging subject's situation
or private conditions. Rather, the satisfaction is derived from the inherent
characteristic in the thing itself which is universally intelligible as
beautiful. Whether or not one agrees with Kant, his explanation of disinterested
judgment presents a distinction between judgments which consider a personal
gain -- as it is the case with economic judgments -- and those which are
not bound up with concepts, feelings, or deliberations unique to the judging
subject given particular circumstances -- as Kant describes the satisfaction
obtained from the beautiful to be. See, Immanuel Kant, <U>Critique of Judgment</U>,
J. H. Bernard's translation, 1968, pp. 38-46.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_7_"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>7. <SUP>7</SUP> First-order goods are
those which provide an immediate satisfaction of a need or want. Higher-order
goods, such as second-order or third-order goods, are those which stand
in the mediate stages toward the satisfaction of a need or want. As such,
higher-order goods do not provide a direct satisfaction in themselves,
although their importance lies in the fact that they are the intermediate
needs toward the satisfaction of an end. The value attributed to yeast,
flour, butter, and eggs is, for example, dependent on the putative value
of the bread for which these ingredients can be used to produce. If the
agent perceives a connection between the prospective value of the bread
in connection with the satisfaction of his hunger, then the bread as a
good of a first order will determine the putative value of all of the ingredients
as goods of a higher order.</FONT>

of a building is not equal to the capital invested in the factors of production
for the construction of the building. Rather, the future value of the building
will depend on the putative value of the satisfaction the agent will have
to forego in the present if his capital and entrepreneurial activity were
not dedicated to the construction of the building. The sacrificed present
value of his resources will determine the expected future value of the
chosen alternative.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_9_"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>9. <SUP>9</SUP> The main reason for
this is that the body of economic theory does not address the ontological
status of 'number.' Furthermore, to establish such an ontological commitment
is philosophically problematic since it does not explain how we establish
the epistemic link with abstract, mind-independent entities. In other words,
since numbers are not part of our sensory experience, how do we acquire
knowledge of numbers? And, further, how do numbers enter the realm of human
interaction such that, when I utter "two," my interlocutor grasps my meaning
of "two"?</FONT>

mathematical objects. The considerations offered in this discussion rely

price tag for a pair of shoes was marked at $100 dollars. If the potential
buyer estimates that the pair of shoes has more value to him than other
potential uses of the $100, then he will buy the shoes. This does not mean
that the price is equal to the subjective value of the shoes to the buyer.
The price of $100 that the buyer is willing to pay only reflects that the
subjective value of the shoes is <U>at least</U> $100. But it is possible
than the buyer might have been willing to pay $150 or more for the pair
of shoes.</FONT>
