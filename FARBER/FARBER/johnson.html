<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>"Words have meaning." This
seems to be about as simple and clear an assertion of a factual state of
affairs as any statement that one can make. On closer inspection however,
it merely raises the question as to what "meaning" is.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>
If in saying; "Words have meaning." one intends to convey the idea that
meaning is a property of words in the same way that a dog has four legs
and a tail, then I would suggest that the speaker has a rather inaccurate
notion of what meaning is. In order to clarify the nature of meaning, this
paper will examine how speech act theory explains some of the many different
ways in which meaning is communicated through speech acts. However, before
doing that, it is important to give some consideration to the ontological
status of words and meaning so as to avoid some of the common misconceptions
which seem to be associated with this type of analysis.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>First, it should be noted
that words are not "objects" or "things" that have properties of their
own in the same way that actually existing things do. Words are relational
entities. Which is to say that words are composed of parts that are not
integrated by any form or structure intrinsic to the word itself. The symbols
(marks/sounds) which taken together constitute a word, make the word real
insofar as it exists outside the mind; but, as vibrations in the air or
as marks on paper, words exist as relational entities and not as actual
things.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP> This is due to the fact that
the medium which carries the word is not proportionate to the idea or concept
which constitutes the form of the word.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP>
All that the air or paper and ink can carry is the symbolic representation
of the actual form which is understood within the mind, and not the form
itself.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When a word is spoken or
written it becomes a relational entity which lacks the power to do or to
cause anything. While it is true that the vibrations in the air or the
marks on a piece of paper can stimulate the senses, a word as such, can
not cause knowledge. As Augustine noted:</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>We learn nothing by means
of these signs we call words. On the contrary, as I said, we learn the
force of the word, that is the meaning which lies in the sound of the word,
when we come to know the object signified by the word. Then only do we
perceive that the word was a sign conveying that meaning.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The person who hears or sees
the word must already know what it means if she is to be able to understand
it. That is why, if someone does not understand the meaning of a word,
you must explain it using other words which she does understand, give examples,
or point to some real thing so that she can come to know what it is that
you are talking about. If human beings could directly cause knowledge in
one another, then we would communicate through a direct spiritual contact
such that one person would be able to directly infuse a specific form into
the mind of another. Since that is not how we communicate however, it is
clear that our words do not directly cause knowledge to appear in the mind
of another. Instead, our words are tokens or signs which can only function
as a formal cause in that if the other person already knows what the word
means, she will be able to recognize it and form the appropriate concept
in her own mind.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Communication between human
beings, therefore, involves an active receptivity on the part of the hearer
and not a mere passivity. The spoken or written word does not directly
actualize some potency in the mind of the receiver. Rather, it prompts
him or her to look at things in a new way so as to be able to form new
concepts and thereby grow in understanding. Thus, words are not in themselves
"things" which cause knowledge, but relational entities which carry the
value of meaning. It is meaning which must be present for communication
to occur. It follows that, although words are not actual things, and as
such, are not the efficient cause of the knowledge one gains through the
use of language, words do have value. Their value lies precisely in the
meaning which they carry.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It is important to note that
the concept which gives a word its meaning is only joined to the word in
the mind of the person who understands it. The spoken or written word is
in itself, just a symbol which must have a concept attached to it; first,
by the person who speaks or writes the word, and secondly, by the person
who hears or reads the word. So it is that the meaning which a word has
is totally subject dependent, both from the standpoint of the person who
speaks a word, and from that of the person who hears it.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The meaning of a word is
something which is simply projected onto the token which carries it. This
is done, not only by the person who first speaks the word, but also by
the person who hears it. Therefore, if any meaningful communication is
to occur between persons, there must be at least some intersubjective agreement
as to what the words mean, given the context in which they are used. The
fact that there are many different languages and many different words which
all can be used to refer to the same thing, shows just how subjective the
whole process of communication through the use of words really is. If it
were not for definitions, grammar, and all the other rules concerning how
to use a particular language, we would hardly be able to communicate with
each other at all.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Given the relational status
of words, and the subject dependency of the meanings which they carry,
one should anticipate a degree of complexity to the word - meaning relation
that would render any simplistic or reductionist theory of meaning untenable.
It is for this reason that speech act theory becomes very helpful at this
point because it reveals how a difference in use also entails a difference
in meaning. The distinction which J.L. Austin makes between locutionary,
illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts illustrates this point very well.
Austin writes:</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>We first distinguished a
group of things we do in saying something, which together we summed up
by saying we perform a <I>locutionary act,</I> such which is roughly equivalent
to uttering a certain sentence with a certain sense and reference, which
again is roughly equivalent to 'meaning' in the traditional sense. Second,
we said that we also perform <I>illocutionary acts</I> such as informing,
ordering, warning, undertaking, &amp;c., i.e. utterances which have a certain
(conventional) force. Thirdly, we may also perform <I>perlocutionary acts:</I>
what we bring about or achieve <I>by</I> saying something, such as convincing,
persuading, deterring, and even, say, surprising or misleading. Here we
have three, if not more, different senses or dimensions of the 'use of
a sentence' or of 'the use of language' (and, of course,there are others
also).<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Here Austin restricts 'meaning'
to the sense and reference of a locution. He then goes on to locate the
force of an illocutionary act in the conventional usage of an expression
which thereby determines the kind of act which the speaker is performing.
For example, when a jury delivers a verdict of "guilty" the utterance of
the word has a certain force determined by convention, which the use of
the word 'guilty' in other situations does not have even though the sense
and reference of the word could be exactly the same.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In general, it seems fair
to say that the 'meaning' of a word for Austin is a matter of definition
as specified by the object, action, or state of affairs that one is using
the word to refer to. Defining meaning in terms of sense and reference
alone, however, is somewhat misleading as Searle points out.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If one thinks of sentential
meaning as a matter of sense and reference, and tacitly takes sense and
reference as properties of words and phrases, then one is likely to neglect
those elements of meaning which are not matters of words and phrases, and
it is often those elements which in virtue of their meaning are such crucial
determinants of illocutionary force.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The illocutionary force is
of course, distinct from 'meaning' in the sense in which Austin uses the
word. Even if the force of an expression is determined primarily by using
the expression according to some established convention, however, it also
seems to be the case that the force is attached to and carried by an utterance
in much the same way as the sense and reference are, except that the force
is attached through a social convention, while sense is attached through
a linguistic convention, and reference is attached intentionally by the
speaker.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>For example, if I say to
a friend; "I promise that I will help you paint your house on Saturday."
I use the sentence to refer to myself (I), another person (you), an activity
(paint), an object (your house), a time (Saturday), and a condition (help).
Thus, I intentionally fix the reference of these words, which in turn means
that specific definitions of words are applicable in this situation and
others are not. The word 'promise' is added in order to clarify the illocutionary
force of the sentence so that my friend knows that I am undertaking an
obligation to help him and am not merely expressing an intention or making
a prediction about what I will probably do on Saturday. All of this taken
together and spoken within an appropriate context is what I mean by the
sentence and is the meaning which the sentence has when I speak it.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If meaning, therefore, is
taken to be whatever intelligible content is projected onto a sign, symbol,
or token by a rational being within the context of performing a communicative
action, the restriction of 'meaning' to sense and reference would appear
to be rather arbitrary. While it is true that illocutionary force is distinct
from sense and reference, it is also true that the meaning of an utterance
is not complete apart from an inclusion of the illocutionary force as an
aspect of the meaning of the utterance. Searle takes note of this point
when he criticizes Austin's distinction between locutionary and illocutionary
acts. no sentence is completely force-neutral. Every sentence has some
illocutionary force potential, if only of a very broad kind, built into
its meaning. For example, even the most primitive of the old-fashioned
grammatical categories of indicative, interrogative, and imperative sentences
already contain determinants of illocutionary force. For this reason there
is no specification of a locutionary act performed in the utterance of
a complete sentence which will not determine the specification of an illocutionary
act.<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If one adopts the broader
notion of meaning as previously set forth, it follows that words or even
sentences, considered as abstract entities, do not have meaning. It is
only communicative acts that have meaning, because meaning only becomes
attached to words or sentences through the action of a speaker or hearer.
An expression takes on a meaning first, in the speech act when a speaker
uses it to express a thought; and, secondly, in the receptive act when
a hearer interprets the utterance and assigns it a meaning out of his or
her own knowledge and experience. In between the speaker and the hearer
an utterance has a certain meaning attached to it that the speaker intends
the hearer to grasp so as to complete the communicative act. It is very
misleading however, to think that words or sentences simply have meaning
apart from the speech act or the receptive act which gives them their meaning.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>An objection seems to be
raised by Searle at this point when he claims that the meaning of a sentence
is entirely determined from within.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The principle that the meaning
of a sentence is entirely determined by the meaning of its meaningful parts
I take as obviously true; what is not so obviously true, however, is that
these include more than words (or morphemes) and surface word order. The
meaningful components of a sentence include also its deep syntactic structure
and the stress and intonation contour of its utterance. Words and word
order are not the only elements which determine meaning.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Based on this statement,
it would appear that Searle holds that while meaning involves far more
than just sense and reference, sentences have meaning apart from their
use in particular speech acts. Thus, while Searle has enlarged the scope
of 'meaning' beyond that which Austin gave to it by locating meaning in
sentences rather than words or phrases, he still detaches meaning from
complete speech acts in holding that the meaning of a sentence is <U>entirely</U>
determined by the meaning of its parts. While I would disagree with such
an interpretation of meaning, Searle's position has a subtlety to it which
deserves further consideration, however, for he also holds that:</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The speech act or acts performed
in the utterance of a sentence are in general a function of the meaning
of the sentence. The meaning of a sentence does not in all cases uniquely
determine what speech act is performed in a given utterance of that sentence,
for a speaker may mean more than what he actually says, but it is always
in principle possible for him to say exactly what he means.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle makes a distinction
here between sentence meaning and speaker meaning which he will draw on
in order to explain indirect speech acts, metaphor, and other complex situations
where the literal meaning of a sentence is not identical with the speaker's
meaning. At the same time he does not wish to completely separate sentence
meaning from speaker meaning for as he goes on to say:</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>for these reasons a study
of the meaning of sentences is not in principle distinct from a study of
speech acts. Properly construed, they are the same study. Since every meaningful
sentence in virtue of its meaning can be used to perform a particular speech
act (or range of speech acts), and since every possible speech act can
in principle be given an exact formulation in a sentence or sentences (assuming
an appropriate context of utterance), the study of the meanings of sentences
and the study speech acts, are not two independent studies but one study
from two different points of view.<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>If the study of speech acts
and is as closely linked to the study of sentence meaning as Searle suggests,
how is it that he also claims that sentence meaning is distinct from speaker
meaning? In rejecting Austin's distinction between locutionary and illocutionary
acts, Searle had argued that while sense and reference are conceptually
distinct from illocutionary force, they are intrinsically united with it
in the utterance of a complete sentence that they are inseparable from
each other. Similarly, is it not also the case that while sentence meaning
and speaker meaning are conceptually distinct they too are inseparably
joined together within the context of a particular speech act?</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>When speaker meaning and
the literal meaning of a sentence coincide the meaning of a sentence is
that which is in accord with all of the relevant linguistic and social
conventions which apply to the normal use of the sentence. If a speaker
uses a sentence metaphorically, however, he gives the sentence a metaphorical
meaning such that it does not have a literal meaning unless a hearer misinterprets
the speaker and takes the sentence literally and gives it a literal interpretation.
In which case, the hearer has misunderstood the speaker by paying more
attention to the linguistic conventions associated with the sentence than
to the intentions of the speaker.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The only other sense in which
a sentence has a literal meaning which differs from the speaker's meaning
is if someone else asks; "what would this sentence mean if it were not
being used metaphorically?" The question here is simply one of inquiring
into the meaning the sentence would have if the speaker meaning and the
literal meaning were the same. In determining what the literal meaning
would be, this person gives an interpretation to the sentence which differs
from that which the original speaker gave it. Thus, it is possible to speak
about a difference between the original speaker's meaning and the meaning
of the sentence if the intention of the original speaker is prescinded
from such that one gives a meaning to the sentence based on the applicable
linguistic conventions alone.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The mistake which needs to
be avoided here however, is that of thinking that the sentence as used
by the original speaker had both a literal meaning and a metaphorical meaning
such that one could speak of the sentence meaning as being different from
the speaker meaning as Searle does. Unless a speaker intends to give two
meanings to a sentence, it has one and only one meaning, and that is the
meaning which the speaker gives to it. Someone else can give a different
meaning to the same sentence based on linguistic conventions alone, but
it then has a different meaning. The original speech act did not have two
meanings, a speaker meaning which can be attributed to the speaker and
a literal or sentence meaning which belongs to the sentence. The speech
act had one and only one meaning, and that is the meaning which the speaker
gave to the sentence.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In itself, a sentence has
no meaning whatsoever. Someone has to give it a meaning, because meaning
is entirely subject dependent. Sounds and marks are not intelligent beings
that have some meaning of their own apart from that which is projected
onto them by someone. Therefore, meaning is not and cannot be a quality
of a sentence which inheres in it in the same way that actual properties
inhere in real things. Meaning is a quality of speech acts or of receptive
acts but not of sentences. Every time a person speaks or hears a sentence
he or she gives it a meaning; but, to think that literal meaning or sentence
meaning somehow exists independently along side of the speaker or hearer
meaning is to completely misunderstand the nature of meaning.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In order to see the full
importance of recognizing the ontological status of meaning prior to analyzing
it, one need only to look more closely at the way in which Searle distinguishes
speaker meaning from sentence meaning.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>sentences and words have
only the meanings that they have. Strictly speaking, whenever we talk about
the metaphorical meaning of a word, expression, or sentence, we are taking
about what a speaker might utter it to mean, in a way that departs from
what the word, expression, or sentence actually means.... To have a brief
way of distinguishing what a speaker means by uttering words, sentences,
and expressions, on the one hand, and what the words, sentences, and expressions
mean, on the other, I shall call the former <I>speaker's utterance meaning,</I>
and the latter, <I>word, or sentence, meaning</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP></FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The position which Searle
clearly takes here is that words and sentences have a meaning of their
own which differs from that of the speaker meaning in cases of ironic,
indirect, or metaphorical usage. If a sentence is to have a literal meaning,
however, someone has to give it a literal meaning. If the speaker uses
the sentence metaphorically, then it has the metaphorical meaning which
the speaker intends it to have. It does not also have a literal meaning
unless someone else interprets the sentence in a way that the speaker did
not intend.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>People mean things by what
they say, and they give meaning to the expressions which they use, but
words and sentences simply do not have meanings of their own apart from
being used by someone.So it is that, words have definitions and sentences
have conventional usages, but only linguistic acts have meaning.</FONT></FONT>
