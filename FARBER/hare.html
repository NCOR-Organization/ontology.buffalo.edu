<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The history of the methods by which the legal system deals
with intellectual property is one of confusion and continuous change, especially
recently. Although a certain amount of this is unavoidable, a large percentage
of the recent problems have been the result of an ontology into which intellectual
property has been shoe-horned, however inappropriately. At the time in
which the intellectual property ontology was set up, it worked well, but
technology has moved us to the point where a complete change will be required
unless we want to have a legal system continuously in flux as technology
changes become faster and faster. It turns out that such a new ontology
is fairly simple to construct, and removes almost all of the problems with
the extant, historically based, ontology. However even though this new
ontology fixes most of the confusion which currently exists, it is still
likely to have some flaws which will be made evident by future technologies.
The hope is that this paper will not only give a better ontology for the
current system, but that discussion provoked by this paper will produce
an ontology of intellectual property that can survive even some of the
possible future technologies.</FONT>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=-1>History and Current State of Intellectual Property
Law in the U.S.</FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Currently the legal system puts almost every aspect of
intellectual property into one of three categories: patents, copyrights,
or trademarks. Broadly speaking, patents and copyrights deal with protection
of an idea from theft, or speaking more legalistically, the protection
of the application/expression of an idea. Trademarks, on the other hand,
deal with forgery/lying about the authorship of a product. The primary
measure by which the adequacy of the ontological system is measured is
the confusion between the different categories of the system, and it turns
out that most of the recent problems with the intellectual property system
have been the result of confusion between the two branches dealing with
theft (i.e. copyrights and patents), and not with the distinction between
theft and forgery. Thus, the remainder of this paper shall deal primarily
with the ontological distinctions of copyrights vs. patents. However, before
discussing the current confusion between copyrights and patents, it is
first necessary to give a brief summary of the state of each category.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>There are currently two legal documents which define the
limits of patent protection. The first is in the Constitution where it
is written that "The Congress shall have power … To promote the progress
of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries".
Although the Constitution is broadly written, the second set of legal documents,
the actual statutes which Congress has enacted under this constitutional
authority, have been considerably more restrictive. In particular, Congress
has restricted patents from general "science and useful arts" to "any new
and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter", and
duration is limited to 20 years (with a few explicit exceptions). At first
glance it may appear that even this is more open ended than it actually
is; after all, the category &lsquo;process&rsquo; is a broad one. However, in practice
the courts have defined &lsquo;process&rsquo; to be a physical process. In <I>Diamond
v. Diehr</I> the Supreme Court ruled that "Transformation and reduction
of an article &lsquo;to a different state or thing&rsquo; is the clue to the patentability
of a process claim that does not include particular machines". In similar
fashion the courts have limited patents to exclude &lsquo;laws of nature&rsquo;, &lsquo;natural
substances&rsquo;, and most importantly &lsquo;abstract ideas&rsquo;.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Also springing from the same paragraph in the Constitution,
copyrights were originally intended to provide protection for artistic
works. The reason for this particular distinction between patents (for
utilitarian works) and copyrights (for artistic works) is historical but
not strictly based in the Constitution. Patents sprang from the Royal Patents
which European monarchs could hand out to traders in particular goods;
these patents gave the trader a monopoly on the particular good, be it
machine, commodity, or whatever. Copyrights, on the other hand, sprang
from the de facto monopoly that printing guilds had over written material
(i.e. art in the form of literature), and through the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century
it was expanded to cover most other forms of art. As with patents, the
Congress has provided a more concrete definition of the protection offered
by copyrights. The primary statutory limitations of importance for the
purposes of this discussion are: 1) the duration is currently the author&rsquo;s
lifetime plus 50 years, 2) copyrighted materials, unlike patents, do not
need to be registered to be protected, and 3) in addition to works of art,
both software and semiconductor chips are considered copyrightable (although
the latter is only protected for 10 years). In addition to the statutory
limitations there are limitations imposed by case law. The ones of primary
importance for the purposes of this discussion are: 1) a copyright is only
allowed on the expression of an idea, not on the idea itself, 2) from the
above limitation, it has been decided that the look and feel of most software
is not protected, since it is an embodiment of the idea itself.</FONT>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=-1>Implicit Ontology of Current IP Laws and the Resultant
Problems</FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>From the relatively detailed description of copyright
and patent protection given above, it is possible to define the ontology
implicit in the current legal system. Of course, this ontology has problems
in that it is neither well defined (i.e. some objects can fit into two
different, supposedly mutually exclusive categories), nor all-inclusive.
It is exactly these problems which are causing much of the current confusion
within the legal system. The implicit ontology is as listed below:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>1) Ideas (not protected in any way)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2) Applications/Expressions</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2.1) Artistic Expressions - Copyrightable</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=-1>2.2) Utilitarian Applications - Patentable</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>As with any ontological system, there are two possible
types of problems for this breakdown. The first is overlapping categories,
and the second is entire categories not included at all in the current
ontology. It turns out that most of the current problems with this ontological
system fall into the first category.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These overlap problems, in turn, can be broken up into
two main types. The first is confusion between patents and copyrights and
the second is confusion between ideas and applications/expressions. However,
before it is possible to give a crisp description of these problems, it
is first necessary to clean up the terminology. Within the legal system
application and expression mean much the same thing, although the first
is used in patents and the second in copyrights. However, these words are
used in two very different ways. Sometimes application/expression is used
to refer to an idea which is derived from some more basic idea (e.g. a
&lsquo;natural law&rsquo;) . In this usage an application/expression is itself an idea.
In other instances application/expression is used to refer to the generic
physical manifestation of an idea (e.g. printed media). It is important
for clarity&rsquo;s sake to differentiate between these two usages, so for the
remainder of this paper &lsquo;derivative&rsquo; will refer to the former usage, and
&lsquo;manifestation&rsquo; will refer to the latter.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The confusion between patents and copyrights first started
with the coming of the information age and is principally the result of
new technology and hence new manifestations. As the ontology makes clear,
copyrights and patents are not awarded based upon the idea itself, but
instead are based on the manifestation of the [derivative] idea. In particular,
in one of the first conflicts, <I>White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo
Co.</I> (1908), it was determined that piano rolls could not be protected
by copyrights because they were not human readable (hence, not strictly
art, but some combination of art and machine). Although the latest revisions
to the copyright laws have attempted to rectify this with pieces of statute
similar to the computer software statutes, it is at best a stop-gap solution.
There are still an infinite variety of items which will not fit neatly
into the redefined categories of manifestations. One example is a computer
which is designed to create a story or a painting according to the creators
general direction. Another example, and one with more consequences, is
the general confusion over software in general - is it patentable or copyrightable?
This last problem arises because artistic expression has become largely
synonymous in the legal system with all written information not used expressly
as instructions to <U>build</U> a machine or define a material process.
One hundred years ago this association was reasonably accurate, but with
modern technology it creates many problems. Thus, software falls under
two separate categories in the current ontology - Copyrightable (as a written
work which is not an instruction on how to build a machine), and patentable
(as a machine, since software, when operating within a computer, is actually
an integral part of the machine). Depending on how the application is written,
the software will be denied either copyright protection or patent protection
even though the underlying work is no different. And, this problem will
only become more severe since today&rsquo;s machine is tomorrow&rsquo;s software as
human beings learn to accomplish more with less. For example, one area
which is likely to create difficulty in the future is genetics. After all,
genetic code is very much like software in that it is a &lsquo;written&rsquo; work
that accomplishes little on its own (and so it is copyrightable?), but
it is actually equivalent in some sense to the chemicals and structures
it produces (and so it is patentable?)</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second overlap problem with the current categories
is that between ideas and the expression/application of ideas (i.e. derivatives
in this context). In the legal community it is assumed that these are two
distinct categories. In fact the problem is that every idea is the derivative
of some higher level idea. For example it is often assumed by the courts
that the &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo; of software is a raw idea (i.e. an idea which
is not a derivative), but the code used to create that &lsquo;look and feel&rsquo;
is the derivative and manifestation of that idea. But, this is a far from
obvious breakdown. Why isn&rsquo;t the look and feel of a software program the
derivative of an idea for a more generalized computer input/output scheme?
Or, for patented items, who makes the decision as to whether a particular
algorithm is a natural law, or is instead derived from a natural law? How
is this decision made? For instance it is often claimed that F=ma is a
natural law, but why is F=ma not considered the derivative of a more basic
natural law that force influences velocity? The problem is that ideas in
general and natural laws in particular form a loose hierarchy, not a distinct
group separate from their derivatives. In fact today&rsquo;s derivative is often
tomorrow&rsquo;s natural law/raw idea or vis versa. Or, for an example in the
art world, the Oedipal story is one that today we would consider a raw
idea, but at the time when it was first written it was probably considered
very unique (i.e. the expression of some even more basic idea for a story
about power and shame). Thus, just as with the confusion due to changing
manifestations, there is confusion because the state of society causes
the derivative status of an idea to change. With this continuously changing
boundary, it becomes very difficult to decide what is protected and what
is not. It is largely arbitrary where the line is drawn, and as might be
expected of a largely arbitrary breakdown, the definition of what is a
derivative, and what isn&rsquo;t, is very unclear. This, in turn, clogs up the
court system with inconsistencies, unclear decisions and drawn out arguments.
For instance, the Ninth Circuit said that each decision about the non-literal
components of program (e.g. look and feel) must be decided on the basis
of the particular facts in the case, <I>Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix
Control Systems, Inc.</I> (1989). While this &lsquo;decision&rsquo; may be accurate
(indeed, self-evident), it is also extremely unhelpful to the lower courts.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally, as mentioned at the start of the current discussion
on the current ontology, there are entire categories of ideas and their
expressions which are excluded from protection. For instance, business
methods, no matter how useful or unique, are specifically excluded by case
law - see <I>Hotel Security Checking Co. v. Loraine</I> (1908). What is
the justification for this exclusion?</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In summary, many of the problems of the current intellectual
property system occur because the ontology is unknowingly tied to a moving
target - human society. As human culture and technology moves, so does
the definition of a &lsquo;application/expression&rsquo;. Thus, intellectual property
law must always be changing to account for the new or changing manifestations.</FONT>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=-1>Towards a Better Legal Ontology</FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Now that we have a better understanding of the problems
inherent in the current intellectual property ontology, it is possible
to design a better one. The obvious requirement for this new ontology is
that it should be tied to items which are much more immutable than the
&lsquo;manifestations&rsquo; and &lsquo;determination of derivative status&rsquo; that are used
by the current system. And, if they must be tied to items that change,
then that relationship should be explicitly acknowledged and well defined
- many of the problems associated with the determination of derivative
status occur because the ontology tries to ignore the fact that derivative
status is not an absolute, but is instead a question of relativity and
is also a function of society. However, before leaping into a new ontology,
it is important to first clarify some terms.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In particular, the definition of ownership is critical
for any discussion about property, intellectual or otherwise. There are
two key aspects of any good definition of ownership, the first of which
is a definition of what is ownable and what is not, and the second is a
definition of the limitations that go with ownership. In the current ontology
the division between ownable and unownable has only one overarching theme
- raw ideas are not ownable. All other details are dealt with in a list-like
fashion. As for the definition of limitations, this is almost exclusively
dealt with in list fashion. This somewhat haphazard definition of ownership,
which has occurred for largely historical reasons, is the ultimate cause
for much of the current confusion. The best way to demonstrate this is
to change the definition and examine the resulting intellectual property
ontology.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In the proposed ontology, ownership should be judged as
a function of three things. Control - If my family controls all aspects
of a plot of land then my family can be said to own it. To the extent that
my family does not control all aspects of this plot of land (for instance,
zoning laws), then it can be said that my family does not have complete
ownership. Time - If my family obtained the land 6 months ago by stealing
it in a family feud, then even if they control all aspects of it, they
can be said not to truly own it. On the other hand, if my family stole
the land from the Native Americans 300 years ago, my family has a much
greater claim on ownership than in the first case. Intent - Time can be
negated by intent. If at the time we obtained the land from the Native
Americans, they intended to cede all control to my family immediately,
then my family can immediately claim ownership. No 300 year wait is necessary.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Having defined ownability to be function of control, time
and intent, it becomes obvious that not only does this concept of ownership
correspond to our intuitive understanding, but it also allows for ownership
of intangible items as long as the three conditions are met. This is in
direct contrast to the extant intellectual property definition of ownership,
which says that raw ideas, because they are intangible, are unownable.
It might appear that raw ideas, and other objects which are duplicated
effortlessly, are unownable because they violate the condition of control
after they are public. However, before they are made public, ideas can
be the most controlled object known to man. The only limitation on this
control is personal desire, and the degree to which no one else is likely
to ever have the same thought. Thus, if I have an idea which no one else
is likely to have in the near future, and I publish it with the obvious
intent to maintain control, then I own this idea. On the other hand, if
it is an idea that many others are likely to have, or if I publish it with
the obvious intent of loosing control, then I either did not ever own it
because I never really controlled it, or I gave up ownership when I made
clear my intent to cede control. It has been argued in "The Ontology of
Cyberspace", a dissertation by David R. Koepsell, that there is an <I>a
priori</I> right to ownership for physical objects, but not for intangible
or easily duplicated objects. The reasoning, which is seductive, is that
the <I>a priori</I> right to ownership cannot apply to cultural items since
the <I>a priori</I> right to ownership "arises <I>not</I> through the enactment
of laws or the creation of cultural norms, but through various acts and
relationships amongst individuals and other objects" However, this is a
basic misunderstanding of ideas or other easily duplicated items as cultural
items. Ideas or easily duplicated items do not owe their continued existence
to the culture, only individuals. After all, even if I moved to Mars and
all cultural contexts were removed, I would still have many of the same
ideas. The interpretation might change - the art that I create, and that
I used to judge abominable, might become my Mona Lisa. But, the underlying
object is unchanged. Ideas in this sense are just as immutable as physical
objects, and the <I>a priori</I> right to ownership applies to them as
much as to other immutable objects. After all, what could be more <I>a
priori</I> (used in the conventional sense rather than the more strict
philosophical sense as used by Koepsell) than the right to own the most
personal and unique things that I have - my ideas.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The only practical problems in this concept of intellectual
property are ones of degree, although this is not really that different
from determination of ownership for more concrete items. In particular,
control, time and intent are not black and white issues either for ideas
or for more concrete objects. However, the legal system has already set
some criteria for determining the boundaries on these issues. It has chosen
to set them to maximize the benefits to society, which coincidentally allows
them to broadly obey the ontology implicit in this new definition of intellectual
property. Thus, an idea which is very wide (and which would therefore not
be very controllable) is given wide protection, but for a limited period
of time (i.e. patents for 20 years), reflecting the fact that ownership
of such an idea is inherently limited. (i.e. If person A had not arrived
at the idea, then person B would have because the idea is so wide that
someone would have happened onto it.) On the other hand, more narrowly
interpreted ideas, such as a work of fiction, which no one else is ever
likely to author, are protected for a much longer period of time since
the originator&rsquo;s control is much greater than for the wider idea. And,
the widest ideas of all, over which no one can claim unique authorship,
are afforded no protection at all. The resultant ontology is a simple one.
Every single item in the universe of physical objects and ideas fits somewhere
on the line which has completely ownable (judged primarily by controllability)
on one end, and completely unownable on the other end. The rights and limitations
which accrue to the owner are a function of where on the line the object
exists, although as a practical matter, the courts may choose not to enforce
ownership for trivial or non-useful items (e.g. a dust mote in the physical
universe, or a completely random/non-useful idea in the universe of ideas).
The primary advantage to this ontology is that since the organization by
application/expression is avoided, the system is much less likely to be
affected by changes in human knowledge or technology. It also makes it
clear that the distinction between patents and copyrights is not an absolute
one, but is instead a matter of degree. Thus it avoids all of the problems
listed in the previous section for the extant ontology.</FONT>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=-1>Practical Considerations on the Implementation of
the New Ontology:</FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The primary concern with the current implementation of
intellectual property laws, besides the confusion described previously,
is that patents are notoriously difficult to enforce. This is the result
of two different things. The first is ontological in nature: Patents deal
with the universe of &lsquo;true&rsquo; ideas, whereas copyrights historically deal
with the complete universe of ideas, true or not. As a result the patent
universe is much more crowded with people, and there are likely to be many
more infringements. The new ontology does not directly help to fix this
problem, although it does make the cause of the problem much more obvious.
If the patent enforcement problem is indeed much more arduous than it was
a half century ago (which is not actually clear), it can only be because
the universe has become more densely packed (density=ideas/people), which
in turn means that each individual must, perforce, have less control over
any given idea. The problem (assuming there is one) is that the courts
have not recognized this fact and have continued to grant patents which
provide protection as wide as they did when the universe was less dense.
Instead, the courts should be asking the question: "Given the situation
at the time of the patent filing (the state of the technology, and the
number of people working in the field), how many other people were likely
to discover the idea within the next six (?) months?". If the answer is
more than 2 or 3 (?) then perhaps the idea is too wide, or the duration
of the patent is too long.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The second reason for the difficult enforcement of patents
is that the government thinks it is necessary to "grant" a patent, as opposed
to just making the information public as part of the patent process. Thus,
no matter how obvious, trivial or uncontested the patent, the application
must be judged. This in turn leads to excessive bureaucracy and costs.
In contrast, the government does not "grant" copyrights. Instead it is
up to each individual to detect infringement and enforce the copyright.
This difference between copyrights and patents is probably a legacy of
the fact that originally written works were much more widely available
than information about patents. Thus it was completely practical to allow
copyrights to be enforced by the individuals affected, but it was not practical
to do the same with patents. However, technology has made it possible to
make patent materials as widely available as copyrighted material (e.g.
patents could be put in a searchable on-line database). Thus, the arduous
process of "granting" patents should be made obsolete, and instead the
government should just set up a registration and disclosure system.</FONT>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=-1>Conclusions</FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The proposed new ontology provides insights not otherwise
available into the reasons for many of the current problems with the intellectual
property system, and if the new ontology were incorporated into the legal
system, it would remove many, if not all, of the current inconsistencies.
In doing so it would obviate the need for even more radical reforms such
as the one proposed by Koepsell in the previously mentioned essay. In this
work it is pointed out that the primary problem with software is piracy
(the exact duplication, and subsequent resale of a software work without
paying any dues to the originator), and that patent protection, a notoriously
difficult process, is inadequate for preventing this. However, many software
authors are getting patent protection because of its wider protection,
if lesser duration. The concern is that this may lead to significant problems
of enforcement. However, under the new ontology it becomes clear that the
primary difference between copyright and patent protection is just the
width of the ideas protected, and patent protection subsumes copyright
protection since patent protection is wider. Thus, for the purposes of
combating software pirates, it is not necessary to go through a &lsquo;normal&rsquo;
patent suit. Instead a suit that looks much more like an ordinary copyright
suit would be sufficient to prove infringement.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In conclusion, the new ontology solves most, if not all,
of the current problems within the intellectual property system, but even
it is not immune to future problems. For instance, one area that is sure
to cause problems is the fact that sometime in the relatively near future
there will be &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; produced which are not understood by any human or
group of humans. Currently this process is in its infancy, but there are
already instances where it is happening. One example is that neural nets
are being used to solve more and more processing problems, however the
neural nets solve the problems without any input from humans, and in fact
it is extremely difficult to reverse engineer the &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; from the solution
at which the neural nets have arrived. Thus, it is quite possible that
two different neural nets will solve the same problem, but it will be impossible
for humans to determine whether they solved it in substantially different
ways or not. Given the fact that social institutions have a history of
being a step or two behind technology, maybe we should just be happy with
the new ontology, which at least brings the legal system up to date with
the current technology and provides clear guidance for incorporating most
new technologies? Or maybe not?</FONT>
