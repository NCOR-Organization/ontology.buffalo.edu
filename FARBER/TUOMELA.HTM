Acceptance Model of Collective Sociality</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>

<UL><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In general we can say that
social and collective properties and notions are man-made and that when
people act on these notions a part of the social world becomes man-made.
There are two important features of sociality and the collective creation
of some central aspects of the social world (emphasized by such authors
as Barnes (1983), Bloor (1996), Kusch (1996), and Searle (1995)). The first
feature is that of the <I>performative</I> character of many social things
(entities, properties). The second is the <I>reflexive</I> nature of many
social concepts. My account adds to this list a third feature, the collective
availability or <I>"for-groupness"</I> of collective social items.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>I will argue in this paper
that much of sociality is created through collective acceptance. I have
elsewhere developed a "Collective Acceptance" account of sociality (see
Tuomela and Balzer, 1997). The first section of the present paper will
sketch this account. The second section discusses the philosophical content
of the account in more detail. The third section applies the view to the
problem of ontology of the social world.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Collective
Acceptance account of (collective) sociality, emphasized by many earlier
authors and developed in detail in Tuomela and Balzer (1997), certain entities
get their collective social status by being collectively created. For example,
almost any kind of physical entity - for instance, squirrel fur - can "in
principle" become money through the members of the collective in question
accepting it as money. As soon as they cease to collectively accept it
as money and to mutually believe that it is money, squirrel fur loses its
status and function as money.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>We must distinguish between
a) the collective creation of an idea, b) collectively holding and maintaining
it, and finally c) collectively realizing it or carrying it out. Collective
acceptance relates to a) and b) in the first place. I have argued that
collective acceptance entails holding a "we-attitude" of a suitable kind
(cf. Tuomela, 1995, Chapter 1, Tuomela and Bonnevier-Tuomela, 1997 for
the notion of a we-attitude). The we-attitudes that are needed for collective
acceptance basically belong either to the intention-family or to the belief-family
of attitudes. My account concentrates on intentional actions, since all
collective acceptance can be or could have been intentional. (Even if in
actual life collective acceptance may be non-intentional, it could have
been intentional; and this suffices for the present account resembling
political contract theories in this respect.) Since intentional actions
arguably are based on intentions and beliefs, it suffices to deal with
these notions. Intentions entail motivating wants or pro-attitudes in a
broad sense, and in this respect the present account also presupposes underlying
wants.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Consider collectively intentional
collective acceptance. For instance, in a group there might be a (weak)
we-goal to oppose the recent tax increase; viz. this is the group members'
goal and they believe that the others share this goal and believe that
this is a mutual belief among them. Another example involving collective
acceptance as we-belief would be one where the group members believe that
the earth is flat, believe that others believe so and also believe that
this is mutually believed in the group. Collective acceptance in this kind
of situation can be generally construed as acceptance either in the sense
of conative commitment to a sentence or proposition s (intention to make
s true or to uphold s as in the tax increase example) or doxastic commitment
to s (the "acceptance" belief that s is true). Collective acceptance here
is a) (weak) "we-acceptance", viz. each person comes to accept s, believes
that the others accept s, and also believes that there is a mutual belief
about the participants' acceptance of s. This we-acceptance can be either
private acceptance (acceptance in the "I-mode") or acceptance in the "we-mode".
In the latter case also a collective commitment (we-mode commitment) to
s is entailed, and then we get the minimal sense of acceptance for the
group (and the involved "we-mode" togetherness) which (intersubjectively)
involves the group. Without the "we-mode" mutual belief there is not enough
intersubjectivity and collective commitment for the application of the
phrase 'for the group' and for saying that the participants are attempting
to see to it collectively that the accepted content will become or - as
the case may be - remain satisfied. Acceptance "for the group" can be viewed
as entailed by acceptance in the we-mode (e.g. "We accept that s is true
or correctly assertable for us in our group-related activities").</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Stronger forms of collective
acceptance "for the group" are norm-based, institutional acceptance and
plan-based or agreement-based collective acceptance. An example of the
first of these is the collective acceptance that driving when drunk is
wrong and punishable, that anniversaries in a marrige ought to be celebrated,
and perhaps also in some collective that squirrel fur counts as money.
The last example is based on the social norm (the genesis of which I will
not here try to give an account of) that everyone in the collective ought
to treat squirrel fur as money. An example of plan-based or agreement-based
collective acceptance is the group members' joint decision to elect a certain
person as their leader. In general, acceptance for a group entails mutual
belief in the acceptance, at least in "egalitarian" groups and in groups
in which the normative structure in the group does not affect collective
acceptance.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>The following general thesis
of sociality in a collective sense or of "collective-sociality" can now
be proposed (Tuomela and Balzer (1997):</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Collective Acceptance Thesis
(<I>CAT</I>): The sentence s is <I>collective-social</I> in a primary sense
in a group G if and only if the following is true for group G: a) the members
of group G collectively accept s, and b) they collectively accept s if
and only if s is correctly assertable.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In the analysans a) is the
assumption of the categorical collective acceptance of s while clause b)
is a partial characterization of the kind of collective acceptance that
is needed here.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In symbols,</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>(<I>CAT</I>*) s is collective-social
in a primary sense in G if and only</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>if</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Forgroup(CA(G,s) &amp; (CA(G,s)
&lt;-> s)).</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Here the 'operator' CA represents
the collective acceptance of s by G for G. Forgroup(G,s) means that s is
correctly assertable (or, as a special case, true) for the group G in question
(see Tuomela and Balzer, 1997, for discussion). (Forgroupness in general
entails mutual belief concerning acceptance.) CA must be a performative
achievement-expressing notion and 'acceptance' is general enough to cover
both the creation and upholding of s and has achievement conceptually built
into it. That a sentence is correctly assertable for G means, roughly,
that the group members are collectively committed (in the "we-mode") to
the sentence and hence treating it as correctly assertable (or true) in
their various intellectual and practical activities in group contexts and
when acting as group members.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Consider now briefly the
notion of collective acceptance as characterized by (<I>CAT*</I>): Forgroup(CA(G,s)
&lt;-> s). First consider the implication from left to right:</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Forgroup(CA(G,s) -> s) (Performativity)</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This is true simply on the
basis of the notion of collective acceptance, which is an achievement notion
relative to the group's "intentional horizon." What is accepted by the
group is correctly assertable or true for the group members.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Next consider the converse
implication:</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Forgroup(s -> CA(G,s)) (Reflexivity)</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>This gives a central and
often emphasized "mark of the social": The truth of s for G makes reference
to s itself within the sentence CA(G,s). This condition will be discussed
in Section II.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>We can say that a sentence
is collective-social in a derived sense if it is not collective-social
in the above primary sense but presupposes for its truth (for the group)
that there are some relevant true (for the group) sentences which are collective-social
in the primary sense. For instance, sentences using 'power' or 'wealth'
are at least in some cases candidates for collective-social sentences in
a derived sense. Latent or unilateral social influence are social features
of the social world that would not - and correctly so - be cases of even
derivatively collective-social features even when many agents are concerned.
The same holds for "naturally" social emotions such as envy (unless they
are specifically about socially constructed things). Many shared we-attitudes
also are not socially constructed (for instance, shared we-fear can be
regarded as a "natural" social phenomenon).</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>(<I>CAT</I>) leads also to
an account of social institutions in the broad sense. Due to limitations
of space, let me just briefly consider the matter and present the following
suggestion (see Tuomela and Balzer, 1997):</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>(<I>SI</I>) A norm-entailing
sentence s expresses a <I>social institution</I> in a primary sense in
a collective G if and only if the members of G collectively accept s for
G, with the understanding that collective acceptance for the group entails
and is entailed by the correct assertability (or truth) of s.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Social institutions in a
derivative sense can be characterized analogously. In them the sentence
s is collective-social in the derivative (rather than in the primary) sense.
Norm-based social power-relations could be cited as an example of social
institutions in the derived sense.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>My somewhat tentative thesis
is that the family of intention concepts (including agreements and commitments)
and acceptance beliefs (doxastic takings) are the basic attitudes needed
to sustain (<I>CAT</I>), but a detailed defense is not possible here.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Searle's (1995) theory of
the construction of social reality shares many features with my above account.
His basic formula for collective acceptance in the context of social institutions
is "We accept that S has power (S does A)" (Searle, 1995, p. 104, 111).
This is understood to be implicitly entailed by my central acceptance sentence
"We collectively accept s" (or CA(G,s)), but what is explicitly accepted
in my account is the sentence s, e.g. s = squirrel fur is money, and not
the underlying powers, rights and duties, concerning the possessors of
squirrel furs and other members of the group.</FONT></FONT>

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>II The Scope of Collective
Acceptance</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>What is the precise class
of sentences s to which (<I>CAT</I>) is claimed to apply? Underlying my
Collective Acceptance model is the general assumption that in each context
of application one can distinguish between sentences whose obtaining or
"truth" is entirely up to the members of the group (or up to their conceptual
activities, especially to what they on metaphysical grounds <I>can</I>
accept as true) and sentences whose truth is at least in part up to nature
(as opposed to them), to the way the world is, and thus in part dependent
on the causal processes occurring in the world "outside them." It is built
into the nature of the equivalence in (<I>CAT</I>) that it is concerned
with things which are up to the group members and are as "viewed" by them.
Therefore, group members can collectively accept (for the group) the correct
assertability or truth of some sentences, e.g. "Stars determine our fate,"
without making it to be the case that those sentences are true in the standard
sense.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Generally speaking, social
concepts and sentences are reflexive in the following sense (cf. Searle,
1995, Chapter 2. A collective-social sentence using a putatively social
predicate (e.g. 'money,' 'leader,' or 'marriage') does not apply to real
things (such as certain pieces of paper or squirrel furs in the case of
'money') unless collectively accepted and, so to speak, validated for that
task. Let us consider money as an example. The predicate 'money' does not
refer to itself but to coins, dollar notes, squirrel furs, and so on. Reference
here means that 'money' correctly applies to those things. The loose talk
about reflexivity in this context therefore should be understood as being
about presupposition-stating sentences such as "Money is not money unless
collectively accepted to be money." This is not a matter of what phrase
to use but what the concept of money is. This concept is expressed by what
the user of the predicate 'money' in English is entitled to say and, especially,
extralinguistically do (and what he may be obligated to do). The concept
of money thus connects with some deontic powers and obligations collectively
bestowed upon those who use the predicate 'money' and who belong to the
collective in question. The discussed presupposition (viz. that money is
not money unless collectively accepted to be money) is central precisely
because of the following assumed fact: It is up to the members of the collective
- and nobody else - to bestow those extralinguistic deontic powers upon
its members. This contrasts with sentences involving only physical predicates
like 'tree' or 'heavy.' In their case it is not up to the members of the
collective to do more than stipulate how to use certain linguistic phrases
and, e.g. what word to use for trees.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It can thus be said that
the alleged reflexivity of collective and social concepts strictly speaking
is not directly concerned with the entities that the concepts (predicates)
apply to. Rather, we may say that a collective-social concept is conceptually
reflexive or "self-conceptual" in the sense that it presupposes itself;
and this can be explicated in terms of truth (for the group) as follows.
When for a social predicate q a sentence q(a) is true (for the group) this
presupposes the collective acceptance of a as q in the group. Thus, if
q(x) expresses that x is an item of money and a stands for a squirrel fur,
then the statement q(a) can be true (for the group) only if squirrel furs
are, in fact, collectively accepted as money or "made" money in the group.
A similar point can be made about, meanings of words, leaders, marriages,
property rights, and so on.</FONT></FONT>

<CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>III On the Ontology
of the Social World</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It follows from the Collective
Acceptance account that the parts of the social world it applies to are
collective-socially constructed and therefore man-made. This, however,
needs qualifications. Let us consider the matter.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>It can be, and has been argued,
that reality is criterially connected to causality in the sense that an
entity cannot be real unless capable of occurring in singular causal "inquirer-independent"
contexts (viz. in claims of the form C(f,f'), C standing for causation
and f, f' being inquirer-independent facts related to the entity in question).
Here inquirer-independence is independence of an inquirer's mind (or the
"ideally rational" scientific community's "mind", viz. attitudes, views,
etc., or best-explaining theory, or what have you). Roughly speaking, the
inquirer-independence of causation here can be understood in the sense
of causation in a world similar to ours but in which there are no inquirers
with minds. (Cf. Tuomela, 1985, Chapters 4-7, for a discussion of this
from the point of view of scientific realism.) Note that our present criterion
for an inquirer-independent world "out there" allows that the world contain
creatures possessing minds (e.g. intentions and beliefs). In addition to
inquirer-independent reality "out there" we have a group's (any group's,
large or small) point of view. From a group's point of view the social
institutions and other collectively constructed and upheld things in that
group are collectively "mind-dependent" in the sense of being constitutively
dependent on the group's acceptance and thus its attitudes. These things
- dependent on the group's "mind" - can nevertheless be said to be "socially
real" in the group (viz. intersubjectively real and belonging to the group's
posited "public space"), and they are also real in the sense of being independent
of an external inquirer's point of view. (There are of course also things
which are dependent only on a particular person's mind - e.g. a person
remembering an appointment.)</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>From a group's point of view
there can thus be things which depend for their existence (creation, recreation,
and maintenance) on intentional group activities, depending thus on the
underlying intentions and beliefs of the group members (cf. the "duality
models" of Giddens, 1984, and Bhaskar, 1989). Note that the group members
generally need to have right thoughts about e.g. money and the school,
etc., when they act, but they need not of course think that by so acting
they contribute to the maintenance and renewal of the involved institutions.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>As said, the Collective Acceptance
account presupposes the following dichotomy: There is a viable distinction
to be made between sentences whose truth (or, more generally, correct assertability)
is entirely up to "us" (viz. up to the group members or indeed any human
beings or beings capable of operating as the view requires) collectively
considered (or, rather, up to our conceptual activities) and sentences
whose truth is at least in part up to the way the inquirer-independent
world causally is. This assumption presupposes that sense can be made of
the causal processes occurring in the world "out there." Thus, according
to this view, group members can collectively accept (for the group) the
truth of some sentences, e.g. "Stars cause our fate," without making it
the case that those sentences are true in the standard sense. Using other
well-known philosophical terminology, we can try to say that here (<I>CAT</I>)
applies only to the entities and features belonging to the conceptual order
rather than to the causal order. While on the right track, this is not
quite right, for (<I>CAT</I>) has ontic import. It connects with the inquirer-independent
causal order by giving the participating group members rights (permissions)
and duties (obligations). Accordingly, the fact that the group members,
<I>qua</I> group members, have rights and duties entails their being (conditionally)
disposed to act in certain specific ways. This is an entailment of ontic
content.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>While making a distinction
between what is up to us collectively to achieve and what is up to nature
is basically right, I think, considering the matter epistemologically,
that its precise content is not an <I>a priori</I> knowable matter. Here
is a point which supports the <I>a posteriori</I> status of the distinction.
Assume that a group g collectively accepts, among other things, causal
statements (both singular and general, e.g. that a bridge collapsed because
of a heavy truck crossing it or that smoking causes cancer). Here we have
embedded causality in a broader frame of collective acceptance by putting
a non-social claim, viz. a claim about a non-social causal connection,
in the same "acceptance-box" as, say, the statement about stars determining
our fate - a merely social claim with an incorrect causal content. In more
general terms, the embedding here goes as follows. We start with a comprehensive
system of causal relations including relations of a purely social nature
as well as other relations. In this system we can delineate the social
causal relations as those which satisfy the Collective Acceptance model.
Now a good epistemic procedure should be able to distinguish between those
collectively accepted causal connections which are not inquirer-independent
in the meant sense from those which are. I submit that the scientific method
(perhaps already our current view of it) is able to do the job. Thus, for
instance, by means of theorizing and testing the constructed theories we
are led to a warranted rejection of the claim that stars determine our
fate, or that "<I>similia similibus curantur</I>" (the central claim of
homeopathy), or that smoking is not a causal factor of lung cancer (the
central claim up to now of tobacco industry). This <I>a posteriori</I>
method does (or tries to do) "from within" what the older metaphysical
views do from an external point of view and in an <I>a priori</I> sense.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Is the social world real
(viz. is full-blown realism about the social worl warranted)? As seen,
the matter crucially depends on what is meant by the social world and by
something being real. Basically, at least realist can regard the social
world as real in the inquirer-independence sense, viz. the social world
exists independently of an inquirer's mind or of the inquirers' community's
viewpoint. However, a part of the social world is dependent on collective
acceptance, as emphasized, and is in this sense "socially real". As a consequence,
in order to be intelligible (in the sense of being correctly explainable)
at least this part of the social world must be conceptualized as its inhabitants
conceptualize it (squirrel fur may be money for medieval Finns but not
for others).</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>According to our collective
acceptance account, social institutions, <I>qua</I> some kind of collections
of position-involving normative structures, are causally effective ultimately
only via the group members' minds and actions. This is a kind of ontic
individualism or "interrelationism" (see Tuomela, 1995, Chapter 9). I cannot
here argue for this view, which, let me emphasize, does allow for social
entities which are supervenient on individuals' minds and actions (etc.).
However, in general social <I>concepts</I>, especially institutional ones,
can be regarded as irreducible primitives. Let me note that social institutions
can have and often do have causal impact via the participants' (in collective
acceptance) thoughts and thus subjectively (in the group members' beliefs)
<I>qua</I> social institutions, or at least their central nervous systems
(in non-intentional cases). The "internalized" rights and duties related
to institutional entities like money or institutional positions (e.g. teacher)
can, accordingly, in this embedding involve causal connections independent
also of the group members' minds.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>In "non-normative" cases
(cf. leader, esteem, status) based on collective acceptance in the sense
of mutual acceptance belief (viz. the acceptance of something as true for
the group) the analogous holds, for collective acceptance always is group-relative,
viz. it relates the constructed and recreated things to the group (thus
to the mental life of the group members; cf. Tom is our leader only in
so far as accepted by us as our leader).</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Physical social artefacts
such as church buildings, cars, chairs, and books exist as causally effective
entitities. They can enter causal connections not only <I>qua</I> having
suitable physical features but also, and in the present context in an important
sense, <I>qua</I> being artefacts expressing normative or non-normative
collective practices (see Tuomela, 1998, for <I>qua</I>-causation).</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, there are social
properties and relations which can be regarded as real in a more naturalistic
sense and which correctly fall outside the scope of the Collectie Acceptance
model. For instance, Tom's being jealous of Jane is an example of such
a non-constructed social fact. Another example is provided by some shared
collective attitudes (or we-attitudes) in the "I-mode" (but not those in
the "we-mode") in the sense of Tuomela (1995). A concrete example would
be our we-fear that a lion will attack us.</FONT></FONT>
