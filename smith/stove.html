</P><P><FONT size="+1"><B>Lakatos</B>: Cook 'discovered' Cook Strait.</FONT>
</P><P><FONT size="+1"><B>Popper</B>: Among an infinity of equally impossible
alternatives, one hypothesis which has been especially fruitful in suggesting
problems for further research and critical discussion is the conjecture
(first 'confirmed' by the work of Cook) that a strait separates northern
from southern New Zealand.</FONT>
</P><P><FONT size="+1"><B>Kuhn</B>: It would of course be a gross anachronism
to call the flat-earth paradigm in geography mistaken. It is simply incommensurable
with later paradigms: as is evident from the fact that, for example, problems
of antipodean geography could not even be posed under it. Under the Magellanic
paradigm, however, one of the problems posed, and solved in the negative,
was that of whether New Zealand is a single land mass. That this problem
was solved by Cook is, however, a vulgar error of whig historians, utterly
discredited by recent historiography. Discovery of the Strait would have
been impossible, or at least would not have been science, but for the presence
of the Royal Society on board, in the person of Sir Joseph Banks. Much
more research by my graduate students into the current sociology of the
geographical profession will be needed, however, before it will be known
whether, under present paradigms, the problem of the existence of Cook
Strait remains solved, or has become unsolved again, or an un-problem.</FONT>
</P><P><FONT size="+1"><B>Feyerabend</B>: Long before the constipated and boneheaded
Cook, whose knowledge of the optics of his telescopes was minimal, rationally
imposed, by means of tricks, jokes, and non-sequiturs, the myth of Cook
Strait on the 'educated' world, Maori scientists not only 'knew' of the
existence of the Strait but often crossed it by turning themselves into
birds, Now, however, not only this ability but the very knowledge of the
'existence' of the Strait has been lost forever. This is owing to the malignant
influence exercised on education by authoritarian scientists and philosophers,
especially the LSE critical rationalists, who have not accepted my criticisms
and should be sacked. "No doubt this financial criticism of ideas will
be more effective than...intellectual criticism, and it should be used."
