<blockquote><b><font size=+1>The High Crime of Perjury</font></b>
<p><b>The Weekly Standard</b>
<br><b>January 4/January 11, 1998</b> <i>David Lowenthal</i>
<p><font size=+0><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/">The Weekly Standard</a></font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;IN THE END, THE CENTRAL QUESTION in the House debate
over the impeachment of President Clinton was whether perjury or lying
under oath is an impeachable offense. There are two ways of approaching
this matter. One is historical: What did the Founders mean when they wrote
in the Constitution that a president could be impeached for "treason, bribery,
or other high crimes and misdemeanors"? And what does our constitutional
tradition indicate? The second approach is to analyze the importance of
perjury to our political system. The House Democrats--following the lead
of some 400 historians who publicly declared their opposition to impeachment--depended
primarily on the first of these, returning, as they think, to the words
of the Constitutional convention. The Republicans relied primarily on the
second approach, applying political common sense to the problem of perjury.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The historical argument is far from confirming the
Democrats' exclusion of perjury as an impeachable offense. Hamilton in
Federalist No. 65 identified impeachable offenses as those "which proceed
from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or
violation of some public trust." Perjury by the chief executive certainly
falls within Hamilton's ambit. Nor is it possible to deny the strength
of the Republican argument about the fundamental importance of truth-telling
to our judicial system. Instead, the Democrats evaded the point by insisting
that perjury is not included in what the Founders meant by "high crimes
and misdemeanors" because, unlike treason and bribery, it is not a direct
attack on the state. Perjury, the Democrats said, just doesn't measure
up.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;In so arguing, the Democrats implicitly admitted
that if one could prove perjury to be of equal gravity with either treason
or bribery, perjury would be an impeachable offense. Indeed, several Republicans
on the Judiciary Committee asserted just such a connection: They called
perjury the twin brother of bribery, noting that the federal penalties
for perjury exceed those for bribery. But they might have gone further,
for it can be demonstrated, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that perjury is
exactly the same sort of thing as bribery--or even worse.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Of the two grounds for impeachment specified in
the Constitution, the first--treason--is defined elsewhere in the document
(Article III, sect. 3) and needs no further explanation. It is obviously
the greatest danger to the state and the whole society. But the second--bribery--does
require explanation. First, it does not seem to be on the same level as
treason, which suggests that high crimes and misdemeanors vary in their
rank or importance. Also, bribes can be either given or taken, and since
neither type is specified in the Constitution, both must be considered
impeachable. Nor is the amount or man-ner of the bribery stipulated: Evidently,
that is left to the judgment of the House and Senate.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;What is it that is dangerous about bribery? When
a public official takes a bribe, he agrees not to perform his duties honestly
and properly. That is the reason for bribing him: to keep him from doing
something he might otherwise do, or to get him to do something he might
otherwise not do. Imagine, for a moment, that the president had tried to
bribe Judge Susan Webber Wright, or a member of the grand jury or a member
of Congress. He would have done so in order to get the person or persons
bribed to act in his favor, regardless of the evidence. If he had done
this, all would agree on his deserving impeachment. The president would
have no defense.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Now assume, instead, that he had committed perjury
in each of these three settings. His perjury in the civil suit against
him would have been designed, like bribery, to thwart that suit. His perjury
before the grand jury would have been an effort, like bribery to thwart
the grand jury investigation. His perjury before Congress would have aimed
at thwarting Congress's investigation. In all three cases, perjury functions
in exactly the same way as bribery. In fact, perjury is worse than bribery:
To preserve secrecy, bribes are usually given to only a small number of
people, whereas perjury, or lying under oath, is an effort to deceive many
people--in this instance, judges, juries, and the American people themselves.
Perjury is bribery consummate, using false words instead of money or other
things of value to pervert the course of justice.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The conclusion is inescapable that perjury is as
much a high crime or misdemeanor as bribery. No doubt instances of perjury,
as of bribery, can range from the petty to the grand, but clearly, for
the president, the chief executive officer, to lie under oath in a civil-rights
suit against himself before a federal judge, thwarting a court-ordered
deposition for the plaintiff, must be impeachable--exactly as an attempt
to bribe the judge would be. Add perjury before both the grand jury and
Congress, and the case becomes ironclad. If bribery is impeachable, perjury
is even more so.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;By singling out for mention the two quite different
crimes of treason and bribery, the Founders invited us to think about them
and the dangers they pose as we determine the meaning of "high crimes and
misdemeanors." This reflection is essential. The House Republicans, having
reflected, were unwilling to make exceptions or bend words for the sake
of the chief executive.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Henceforth let no one call their effort "partisan"
or charge them, as Democrats did, with attempting a "coup d'etat." Knowing
full well that accepting their constitutional responsibilities might injure
them politically, they chose the right path and stood firm under rancorous
attack. They refused either to bend or to respond in kind, thus preserving
the memory and prospect of civility even when it was not being accorded
to them.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Americans must hope that the Democrats in the Senate
will think carefully about impeachment and that the Senate as a whole,
Democrats and Republicans alike, will not fritter away the hard-won accomplishments
of the House Republicans. For it will still be a partial victory for an
unrighteous and dangerous cause if the Senate fails to convict a president
who lied under oath.</font>
