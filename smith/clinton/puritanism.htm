<p><b>The Chicago Sun-Times</b>
<br><b>October 10, 1998</b> <i>James M. Wall</i>
<p><font size=+0>Divining Truth on Impeachment. This is little more than
a witch-hunt in the worst Puritan tradition, writes James M. Wall.</font>
<p><font size=+0>As the impeachment process grinds forward, the question
must he asked: Are we witnessing a foretaste of what could happen if religious
absolutists seized total control of our government? Absolute certainty
as to what constitutes moral behavior is a guiding principle of religious
absolutists, a principle that evokes disturbing reminders of witch-hunts
when the government of the Massachusetts colony was in the hand of religious
puritans and evil was lodged in Satan and those “witches” who followed
his commands.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In their battle against Satan, Puritan religious authorities
brought suspects to trial, and if they found the suspects guilty of acting
as Satan’s minions, they punished them according to the impeachment procedures
of the day. We are far more sophisticated today than were our forefathers.
We no longer “believe” in witches, but we do believe in the presence of
evil in society. Trouble is, we can’t all agree on it’s exact manifestation.
This theological uncertainty has kept us, until now, from allowing a theological
minority to determine governmental actions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Ann Hibbens, one of the “witches” put to death at Salem,
had, according to history scholar Carol Karlsen, initially been “excommunicated
from the Boston church 16 years before her witchcraft trial — not for witchcraft
per se, but (among other sins) for her obstinate challenge to religious,
secular and familial authority, and for her evil influence over other church
members” (The Devil in the Shape of a Woman). Hibbens was guilty of not
adhering to a standard of moral conduct as set by the contemporary religious
authorities. Today, we don’t hang people who are judged guilty of immoral
behavior. But we are apparently willing to consider the impeachment of
a president for sinful conduct and possibly telling lies about that behavior.</font>
<p><font size=+0>I attended the White House prayer breakfast at which the
president acknowledged to a group of religious leaders that what he had
done was a sin. His sense of shame was clear and painful to watch; Bill
Clinton has been sufficiently punished — or did you miss the four hours
of grand jury torture with intimate questions no one should have to answer?
His punishment is obvious in the intrusive questioning of Starr’s 500-page
report, written in solemn, pious prose that resembles nothing less than
the narrative of an old pornographic movie, the kind that warns viewers
that they are about to witness evil deeds being shown only for their own
good.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The American public has been more tolerant of Clinton’s
wrongdoing than have members of Congress now engaged in the impeachment
process. Is this a national tolerance for wrongdoing? Not at all. It is,
rather, a sense of identification and understanding in a public that voices
the age-old confession, there but for the grace of God go I. We are not
a people who approve of immoral conduct, but we do understand how passion
can overrule good judgment, and how one is afterward tempted to lie about
actions evoked by that passion.</font>
<p><font size=+0>There also is no mystery as to why a strong majority of
the African-American community so strongly supports Clinton. Anyone who
has been frightened at the fear of punishment for unfair, nonexistent or
trivial charges — a common African-American experience — can identify with
a president caught in Kenneth Starr’s cross hairs.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Punishment should fit the crime. A 5-year old of my acquaintance
suggests that a proper punishment for Clinton would be to take television
away from him for a whole month. Of course, how would a 5-year-old know
that this president would be more than glad to avoid the cries of “he broke
the law” from Sam and Cokie and George on Sunday morning, and he would
be quite happy not to have to listen to any of the other media martinets.</font>
<p><font size=+0>There remains an ominous smell of sulfur in the air surrounding
these impeachment hearings The moralistic language voiced by Clinton’s
enemies has a distinct Puritanical tone to it. As historian Karlsen puts
it, “Hibbens was executed because these two fears — that witches threatened
their neighbors’ well-being, and that they were Satan’s minions — converged
in her trial, creating together what one early historian called a ‘popular
clamor … against her.’ ”</font>
<p><font size=+0>The only way Congress would be able to vote for impeachment,
and then determine that the president is guilty as charged, would be for
the clamor of the religious absolutists to have made its case that immoral
behavior in the White House must be punished. But if Congress does vote
to remove Clinton from office, it will do so in the ominous and tragic
tradition of those absolutist early American divines who sent witches to
the gallows for their own puritanical purposes.</font>
