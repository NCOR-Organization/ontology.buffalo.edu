<font size=+1><b>Impeachment Hearings</b></font><p>
<b> Rep. Bob Barr e-mail</b><br><b>11/9/98</b>
 <em>Bob Barr</em>
 <br><font size=+0><p> 't expect too much from Law Professors since they have been teaching that Law has no basis in fact and that decisions shall be rendered on the basis of social change and redistribution of the wealth for the last 30 years .
<Paul_Abi>    Hi all<p> As Members of Congress, many of our decisions are easy ones.  Should
the federal government operate under a balanced budget?  Absolutely.
Should welfare recipients be encouraged to work?  Of course they should.<p>However, sometimes our choices aren't so easy.   The process we are
discussing today is the most serious constitutional action Congress can
take short of declaring war.  None of us should take this process
lightly.<p> All but the President's most ardent apologists agree that he lied to
the American people, lied to the court in the Paula Jones case, and lied
to a federal grand jury probing his conduct.  It is just as evident that
he worked to obstruct judicial proceedings by tampering with key
witnesses and evidence.<p> No amount of willful ignorance or rationalization will make these facts
go away.  We may not like these facts.  They may make us sick to our
stomachs.  They may cause us to question some of our most basic
assumptions about the President and the presidency.  But, we must
confront them.  To do otherwise is to knowingly treat the President
differently than the rest of us.<p>  Many of my colleagues on this committee have devoted their lives to
fighting inequality and ensuring equal justice for all Americans.  This
is one of the highest causes a Member of Congress can champion.  For
this reason, I am saddened to see these same members of our committee
working tirelessly to return inequality and special treatment to our
law, in order to protect a President they favor.   Make no mistake about
it; the precedents we set in this matter will remain part and parcel of
our legal system for years to come, damaging or benefiting each of us,
regardless of the political party to which we belong.<p>  All of us who attended church growing up are familiar with the story of
Abraham and Isaac.  When God demanded that Abraham sacrifice his only
son, Abraham was willing to do it because  he realized there truly are
principles that rise above the life of one person, no matter how great a
love we have for that individual.  This is the highest form of devotion,
and it is exactly the choice we face today.  If impeaching Bill Clinton
is necessary to protect our Constitution and preserve the rule of law,
do we have the courage to do it?  I hope and pray that the answer is
yes.<p> If any other citizen -- for example, Ken Starr -- had perjured himself,
even for the best of reasons. I have no doubt all of us, especially
those on the other side of the aisle, would urge his prosecution.
Indeed, the President's own Department of Justice has prosecuted
numerous cases of perjury, including a recent case in which a federal
employee lied about sex in a civil suit.  As a federal prosecutor
appointed by President Reagan, I convicted and jailed a sitting
Republican Member of Congress for perjury.  Perjury and obstruction of
justice are not partisan issues.  They are grave offenses that strike at
the heart of our legal system; the principle that all who participate in
our court proceedings must tell the truth, is the most fundamental
underpinning of our society.

<p> At best, today's hearings will cast a dim light around the edges of a
term the Founding Fathers intentionally left up to future congresses to
define.  Trying to arrive -- in advance of the evidence -- at a precise
definition of "high crimes and misdemeanors," is the intellectual
equivalent of debating how many angels can fit on the head of a pin, or
trying to determine whether a tree falling in the forest makes a noise
if no one is there to hear it.  It may be interesting to engage in such
talk around a coffee table or in an ivy league ivory tower, but it bears
no relationship to the real world of legal or government proceedings.<p>Ultimately, the choice of whether or not to vote articles of
impeachment rests not with legal scholars or historians, no matter how
distinguished their pedigrees.  This choice is ours, and sooner or
later, we're going to have to make it; or else families, teachers, and
prosecutors will have to pay the price as they cope with current and
future generations of liars and perjurers.
        In the final analysis, I don't think there are many Members of Congress
who can say directly, and with a straight face, that a President can
commit numerous felonies and stay in office.  Either all the lofty
phrases we eagerly repeat at every opportunity mean something, or they
don't.  Either all Americans are equal under or law, or some Americans
-- a New Royalty -- deserve special treatment.  Either  truth is the
most valuable commodity in our legal system, or it is worthless.

<p>  Let us use this unique opportunity to shape this debate, define the
issues, and lead the process, rather than continue -- as so many have --
to react, respond, pontificate, and run out the clock.  Our
constitutional clock, now a mere 211 years old, must be kept running.
Our colleagues 25 years ago, and their impeachment staff, including
Hillary Rodham, recognized the importance of this, and so must we.</p></font><hr> <p><font size=+0></font></p>

 Sorry about the first paragraph, that was mine from an irc post in the chat room. I should have proof read it before I posted it!

 A good post, Dale.  How can we possibly allow a felon who 
has scoffed at the legal system appoint any more judges?<br>

 Quick!  Everybody seeing this as of 6:24 p.m. EST, go to MSNBC and vote the opinion of the day.  Let America know that Clinton's crimes are an impeachable offense.  Hurry!<br>

Well, given that he was elected twice there doesn't seem much
that you can do. He will continue to appoint judges unless
he is impeached. And, as Livingston and others are making it
clear, impeachment is totally dead. (see today's Washington Post)<br>
