<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bennett's Latest Outrage</font></b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nation</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dec 3, 1998</b> <i>Michael Massing</i>
<br><br>
<br>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Bennett's<i> The Death
of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals</i> became
an immediate bestseller. In<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addition to outlining the case against Clinton,
the book expresses Bennett's profound disappointment at the lack of public<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; revulsion over the President's behavior.
After considering a number of possible explanations--good economic times,
scandal<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fatigue, aggressive White House spinmeisters--Bennett
confides his real suspicion: "I cannot shake the thought that the widespread<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of outrage against this president's
misconduct tells us something fundamentally important about our condition.
Our commitment<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to long-standing American ideals has been
enervated. We desperately need to recover them, and soon." Bennett goes
on to state his<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hope that Americans will soon "realize they
are being played for fools by the president and his defenders. They will
declare, with<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confidence, that a lie is a lie, an oath
is an oath, corruption is corruption. And truth matters."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bennett's displeasure with the American
public contrasts sharply with the sentiments he expressed in his 1992 book,<i>
The De-Valuing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of America: The Fight for Our Culture and
Our Children.</i> There, he celebrated the wisdom and common sense of the
American people,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which, he asserted, stood out against the
destructive skepticism of the liberal elite. "The American people's sense
of things is<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in most instances right," he wrote; "the
liberal elite's sense of things is in most instances wrong." Conservatives,
Bennett<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrote, were much more in touch with popular
sentiment: "While contemporary liberalism has moved away from--in some
cases, even<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against--the mainstream of American political
life, today's conservatism is more at home with the common sense and the
common<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beliefs of the American people."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To back this up, Bennett cited the many
trips into the hinterlands he had made as Secretary of Education and as
drug czar. On<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these swings, Bennett proudly noted in his
earlier book, he met hundreds of ordinary Americans, and their views strongly
seemed to<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mirror his own. When, for instance, he publicly
expressed support for the idea of beheading drug dealers, "many of the
elites<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ridiculed my opinion. But it resonated with
the American people because they knew what drugs were doing, and they wanted
a morally<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proportionate response." Such differences
contributed to Bennett's belief that the nation was engaged in a "culture
war" pitting<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the traditional values of middle-class Americans
against the inbred negativism of journalists, lawyers and government officials.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need institutions that more accurately
reflect the sentiments and beliefs of the great body of the American people,"
he wrote,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "rather than those of the cultural deconstructionists"
and the "permanent political establishment in Washington."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the current Clinton affair, however,
the American people have stood up to that establishment. Over and over,
polls have<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documented their disgust with Kenneth Starr,
Congress and the news media. Bennett is no longer celebrating them, however.
On the<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contrary, he now finds the American people
<i>lacking</i> in wisdom and moral fiber. In the space of six years, Bennett
has gone from<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extolling the values of mainstream America
to excoriating them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened? On one level, Bennett's change
raises questions about how much his earlier views truly were in sync with
the<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; average American's. The "American people"
he so regularly invokes in <i>The De-Valuing of America</i> (the phrase
appears there more than<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thirty times) was a vague, undifferentiated
mass to which Bennett reflexively attributed views identical to his own.
As evidence,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he cited little more than the comments people
made to him at the highly scripted events he attended as a government official.
Such<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dog-and-pony shows are hardly the place
to take the pulse of public opinion.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, on the other hand, we accept Bennett's
assertion that his views back then were more in line with those of mainstream
America,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then his current sense of alienation suggests
a profound shift in popular sentiment away from the narrow moral agenda
favored by<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bennett and his allies on the right toward
a broader and more tolerant view of human nature. If America has been gripped
by a<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; culture war, as Bennett so strongly believes,
then the public's lack of outrage over Monicagate would seem to indicate
that his<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side is now losing.&nbsp;</font><br>
