<P><FONT SIZE=+2>CLINTON, THE ALPHA MALE, THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, AND WHY
THE TESTES ARE OUTSIDE THE BODY</FONT>

<P>This is going to take some explaining. In the Feb. 9 _New Yorker_, MIT
psychologist Steven Pinker provided an evolutionary explanation for why
famous men gamble their reputations, their careers, and their marriages
on reckless sexual encounters. He says "A prehistoric man who slept with
fifty women could have sired fifty children, and would be more likely to
have descendants who inherited his tastes. A women who slept with fifty
men would have no more descendants than a woman who slept with one. Thus
men should seek quantity in sexual partners, women quality." Pinker goes
on to explain that your average Joe does not have the opportunity for fifty
different women a year, and so has to suppress this drive. Powerful men,
on the other hand, have the opportunity and can't resist it. In his short
comment, Pinker does not carry his argument to its logical conclusion.
Human societies should eventually be dominated, as are many animal societies,
by the "alpha" male, the biggest, strongest, and smartest who passes on
his DNA while the rest of the males slink off in the background. And this,
believe it or not, brings us to the *anthropic principle*. This has become
the latest argument by theologians for the existence of God. It seems the
universe had to be exquisitely tuned to make it possible for our form of
life to evolve. Slight variations if the mass of the proton, the strength
of the electromagnetic force, and other physical parameters would have
lead to a universe far different from ours and certainly no human life.
Thus, the anthropic theologians say, there had to be a creator to choose
the exact laws and parameters of physics to produce life. They do not say
who created this finely-tuned creator. Of course, the logical flaw in this
argument is that we have no idea what other combinations of laws and constants
would produce *some* form of life. Load http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/vjs/www/monkey.html
from your web browser to create your own universe and see that life may
not be as unlikely as it seems. Now, what does this have to do with Clinton
and the alpha male? One Internet wag who called himself "The Gus" has proposed
an anthropic argument for why male testicles are outside the body. You
would think they would be much safer someplace inside, where they would
be better shielded from the swinging swords of the battlefield. This is
something your editor has been meaning to ask his urologist, but he doubts
that very capable physician has given the matter much thought. The anthropic
argument, in somewhat modified form, goes something like this: In animal
husbandry, it is necessary to castrate the majority of males so that the
best DNA gets passed on succeeding generations. Similarly, sultans and
kings always needed a large supply of eunuchs to carry on the business
of the palace without any danger of spreading their inferior DNA around
and producing illegitimate heirs. The process of castration would be far
more dangerous, if not impossible, had the testicles been inside the body.
And so, in order for human societies to thrive, men have to expose them
both. This also explains the "flasher" phenomenon too, don't you see? Someday,
in the inevitable future when the females of the human species finally
take control of society, they will only need to keep a few alpha males
around, like Bill Clinton and your editor. As for the rest of you guys,
watch out for that lady with the knife! Actually, women may not need us
alphas either, once they are able to scramble their own DNA and re-implant
it back into their eggs. Surely this is not much beyond current technology.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>POSTMODERN PSYCHIATRY </FONT>Ian Pitchford reports from
the University of Sheffield that postmodernism is already firmly entrenched
within medical research: "For example, my department is a branch of the
department of psychiatry and therefore part of the University of Sheffield
Medical School. Our 'research methods' course outlines the research that
one might undertake in studying psychiatry: theoretical, qualitative, quantitative,
and emancipatory. The theoretical approaches include: Jurgen Habermas and
the colonization of the public sphere, discourse analysis (rooted in the
strong version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis), textual analysis (Lacan
and Derrida), and the psychoanalytic case study. Needless to stay statistics,
biomedicine and psychology are *not* mentioned as viable approaches - these
positivistic disciplines are 'constituted by discourses of power', they
'privilege rationality' and form part of the state's apparatus for controlling
and suppressing dissent and 'challenging behaviours'. He adds: "I would
say that the majority of people in my department, including some of the
medics, consider mental illness to be a social construction having nothing
to do with the brain as such."
