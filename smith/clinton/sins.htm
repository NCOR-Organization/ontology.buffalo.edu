 <br><font size=+0><p><blockquote>
A couple of events occurred last
                                   week that prove unmistakably just how morally
                                   depraved this country of ours has become &ndash; at least
                                   among the elite -- while simultaneously reinforcing the
                                   fact that not all Americans have lost their sense of
                                   God-given morality. Obviously not all the founding
                                   principles of this nation have been flushed down the
                                   proverbial toilet by the powerbrokers who run things. 
<p>
                                   The first event was political. Two high-ranking
                                   officials &ndash; President Clinton and House
                                   Speaker-elect Bob Livingston &ndash; fell from grace and
                                   power as admissions of extramarital sex reared their
                                   ugly heads, forcing &ndash; yes, forcing &ndash; members of
                                   Congress to &lsquo;do the right thing.&rsquo; 
<p>
                                   One other event was societal. In Stow, Ohio, city
                                   fathers may have to remove a picture of a Christian
                                   cross and an open Bible from the city seal because
                                   the meddling American Civil Liberties Union sued to
                                   have it removed.
<p>
                                   The tragedies of these two events ought to be
                                   obvious, but unfortunately they are not to many
                                   Americans who still believe in the very mortal elites
                                   who position themselves high above us all in Ivory
                                   Towers. However, because there is a debate at all
                                   about these events proves that the country has not
                                   completely lost its soul.
<p>
                                   Anguishing over whether or not to stand for
                                   old-fashioned morality, the majority of House
                                   Republicans accepted Livingston&rsquo;s resignation then
                                   turned to the business of impeaching the liar Clinton.
                                   Though tens of millions of Americans have criticized
                                   House members who indeed were agonizing over
                                   what to do about these two men, it occurred to me
                                   that we should be grateful that they were tormented at
                                   all. If the kind of morality supported by Bill Clinton,
                                   socialist Democrats and the American Civil Liberties
                                   Union were the norm instead of the exception, then
                                   House Republicans would have had nothing to
                                   "anguish" over and would have likely decided to let
                                   Clinton slide. They had already decided to do so for
                                   Livingston, who admitted just a day earlier that he
                                   was a serial adulterer. But alas, the pressure on them
                                   &ndash; and on Livingston &ndash; to repent was just too great.
                                   That&rsquo;s a plus for the moral majority.
<p>
                                   Regarding the Stow, Ohio matter, tragically only
                                   about ten percent of the city&rsquo;s residents even realized
                                   there was a cross and a Bible in their city seal. It was
                                   not until the ACLU stuck their socialist noses into the
                                   foray that the &lsquo;divide and conquer&rsquo; strategy came to
                                   play. Indeed it was tragic that almost nobody knew
                                   there were Christian symbols in their own city seal,
                                   but here again -- after the ACLU-inspired debate
                                   began -- almost 60 percent of city residents said
                                   they&rsquo;d rather see the emblems stay in the seal. Only a
                                   paganist tool of government &ndash; a federal judge &ndash; could
                                   have changed the wishes of the majority. 
<p>
                                   Tragedies and triumphs regarding Christianity
                                   abound every Christmas season. But this year, most
                                   likely because of the very public shenanigans of the
                                   power elite, Americans have really been forced to
                                   look at their own morality and many do not like what
                                   they see.
<p>
                                   Avid Clinton supporters have always said they love
                                   the man&rsquo;s policies but hate his lying, adulterous ways.
                                   Sensible people have trouble dealing with that kind of
                                   logic because normally it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to
                                   support somebody who does not espouse the values
                                   you cherish. I would agree.
<p>
                                   However, it&rsquo;s been easy for folks who have known all
                                   along what kind of scoundrels inhabit our halls of
                                   power to make this distinction. To us there are very
                                   clear lines of right and wrong, and if political and
                                   cultural representatives cross those lines then we will
                                   not &ndash; indeed, cannot &ndash; have anymore to do with
                                   them. It just goes against what we believe.
<p>
                                   For this we are roundly criticized. But it is a moot
                                   point because we&rsquo;re right.
<p>
                                   More and more Americans are finding the simplicity
                                   in this approach. It is much easier to make decisions
                                   about who we&rsquo;d like to represent us when there are
                                   not so many variables to choose from. In Livingston&rsquo;s
                                   case, as in Clinton&rsquo;s, it was easy for me and millions
                                   of others to say, &lsquo;Look, Bob, you&rsquo;re just as bad as
                                   Clinton is because you engaged in the same kind of
                                   behavior that he did. You get points for admitting your
                                   discrepancies and resigning, and yes, you didn&rsquo;t lie
                                   under oath. But you didn&rsquo;t admit it either until you
                                   were forced to. You cannot be held to a different
                                   standard than a man you&rsquo;re getting ready to help
                                   impeach because both of you were befallen by the
                                   same vice -- sex.'
<p>
                                   Back to Stow, Ohio, because this is all related. 
<p>
                                   People who are sick of seeing rulings like the one in
                                   Stow, Ohio are finally &ndash; slowly &ndash; coming to the
                                   realization that in order to stop these kinds of
                                   travesties and insults to our principles, we can&rsquo;t give
                                   free passes to high officials like Clinton and
                                   Livingston. Immoral people surround themselves with
                                   other immoral people, who then make decisions
                                   about our lives that reek of immorality and smack of
                                   prejudice. There is sanity in righteousness that
                                   attracts, whereas the pagan socialism practiced by
                                   hypocrites on the Left only breeds constant turmoil,
                                   division, and bitterness. 
<p>
                                   Because of guys like Clinton and Livingston, Bob
                                   Packwood and Dan Burton, Barney Frank and
                                   dozens of others, we are finally beginning to see that
                                   the rot in our society, our judicial system, and our
                                   culture comes from the top down.
<p>
                                   Is it a shame that these kinds of things have to come
                                   to light during the celebration of Christ&rsquo;s birth? What
                                   better time to confront our sins, rekindle our morality,
                                   and refocus our lives?
