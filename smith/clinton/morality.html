<p><b><font size=+1>The Clinton legacy</font></b>
<p><b>Jewish World Review</b>
<br><b>2/17/98</b> <i>Cal Thomas</i>
<p><font size=+0>OF ALL THE RIVERS OF LIES that have flowed from the Clinton
administration, none will have a greater impact than the stream of bogus
assertions that public and private morals are separate.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A U.S. News and World Report poll taken immediate after
the President's acquittal shows the public isn't buying the administration's
line -- or never did.</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to the poll, 56 percent of the public believes
Bill Clinton is the least moral of all our modern presidents, including
Richard Nixon. Sixty-four percent believe the Clinton sex scandal and the
President's subsequent impeachment will have a negative effect on the country's
moral fiber. Sixty-one percent think it will cause children to have less
respect for the country and the presidency. Forty-eight percent directly
blame Clinton for the controversy, while just 20 percent blame Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Until now, none of this has been reflected in the big
media or by politicians for whom "compartmentalization'' was the only creed.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A new book --" The American Leadership Tradition: Moral
Vision from Washington to Clinton -- arrived in my mailbox the day of the
President's acquittal. It gives a historical overview of the connection
between private and public morals. Its author is University of Texas professor
Marvin N. Olasky, last seen in these parts with his "The Tragedy of American
Compassion,'' which was used by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
a number of Republican governors to reform welfare laws.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Olasky shoots holes in Clinton's compartmentalization
theory by revealing how the morals by which 10 past presidents and two
other leaders lived affected their public policies. And, yes, that includes
links between lying about adultery and lying about other matters.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In his introduction, Olasky lets us in on what he is up
to by quoting Theodore Roosevelt, who said in a 1912 address to the American
Historical Association: "The greatest historian should also be a great
moralist. It is no proof of impartiality to treat wickedness and goodness
on the same level.''</font>
<p><font size=+0>Beginning at the founding of our republic, Olasky discovered
this gem from George Washington: "Purity of morals (is) the only sure foundation
of public happiness in any country.'' While Washington remained faithful
to his wife, Martha, despite some temptations, many of the leaders of the
British army were his direct moral opposites.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sir George Rodney was supposed to provide naval support
for Gen. Charles Cornwallis in 1781. Olasky says Rodney was an adulterer,
a gambler and debtor. Instead of faithfully executing his assigned duties,
he concentrated on building his own fortune and fornicated his way through
the West Indies. Cornwallis received his own job due to favoritism. Such
leadership, writes Olasky, influenced British soldiers who "fought when
they could not avoid it, but otherwise dedicated themselves to gambling,
drinking, and cavorting with camp prostitutes.'' When Cornwallis surrendered
to American and French forces at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, it was clear
the British had lost the will to win and they "gave in as soon as they
could honorably do so.''</font>
<p><font size=+0>Washington, on the other hand, was so admired and respected
by his men that they were willing to freeze to death at Valley Forge in
pursuit of an ideal: independence.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The revered Thomas Jefferson is exposed by Olasky as a
"two-face'' who had to hide not only his behavior with women, but also
his intense hatred of God and the Bible for fear that if such news became
public, his political career would be doomed. Jefferson's moral obtuseness
lead him to view African slaves -- whom he said once free "cannot live
in the same government'' -- as subhuman. "Native habit, opinion has drawn
indelible lines of distinction between them.'' In other words, notes Olasky,
"Blacks were one day to be free -- and the next day deported.'' There is
much more linking Jefferson's private morals and beliefs to bad public
policies.</font>
<p><font size=+0>President Clinton is properly left until last. Olasky
writes of Clinton's frequent meetings with clergy advisers and of their
frustration in trying to get him to admit that he did anything wrong. He
quotes two of the clergymen as saying Clinton always blamed Republicans
and never saw himself as anything but a good man. "After three years of
meetings,'' writes Olasky, "one regular minister to the president merely
shook his head when asked if progress was being made in the central issue
of having the president stop blaming others and start accepting responsibility
himself.''</font>
<p><font size=+0>Was Clinton's latest "confession'' any more real than
the others? Given his life's pattern, the odds are that he is still lying
and that he will continue to lie about his private morals and about his
public policies.</font>
