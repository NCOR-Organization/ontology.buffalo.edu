The Lewinsky Government<br>
 Memo To: Website Fans, browsers, clients<br>
    From: Jude Wanniski<br>
    Re: Government by Intern
    <p>Between now and Tuesday, November 3, the government of the United States, the sole
    superpower of the planet, is being run by Monica Lewinsky. Not that she actually has any
    direct say in what the President and congressional Democrats decide to do on any matter
    requiring decision. Or that she has any direct say in what the congressional Republicans
    decide to do on any matter requiring decision. I mean that the Affair Lewinsky now is and
    has been for some months a central part of the power calculation of our government. </p>
    <p>Yes, there has been a &quot;Wag the Dog&quot; discussion about the President&#146;s
    decisions whether or not to commit the nation&#146;s military might to some foreign
    problem, which would &quot;change the conversation&quot; and cause the American people to
    rally around the Commander-in-Chief at the moment they are strolling to the polls on
    November 3. Let&#146;s see, will he <a
    href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/09-03-98.html">bomb Iraq?</a> Will he<a
    href="http://www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/10-06-98.html"> bomb Serbia?</a> Is there
    another target up his sleeve where he might rid the world of some fiendish terrorist with
    one cruise missile? The problem is we now don&#146;t know if the President is going to
    bomb something that needs to be bombed or is going to bomb something that doesn&#146;t
    need to be bombed, or not bomb something that needs to be bombed -- because of Monica. The
    nation and the world does not have a leader we can be sure is able to separate out the
    national interest and his own behind. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Monica also has <a
    href="http://headlines.yahoo.com/Full_Coverage/US/Intern/">determined the path</a> the
    Republican Congress is treading. If it were not for her, and the chance the Affair will
    cause the electorate on November 3 to elect MORE GOP Senators and Representatives, the
    Republican Congress would have demanded a tax cut and gone to the wall to get one from the
    White House. It would have killed any chance the International Monetary Fund would get
    another $18 billion to destroy almost every economy it touches. (<i>The Wall Street
    Journal </i>gives the IMF credit for helping Argentina through a bad patch, but the <i>Journal</i>
    is much too generous, as the price the IMF exacted for its assistance has kept Argentina
    in the dumps.) It would have behaved like the government of the people, which is what
    Congress is all about. Instead, it crossed its fingers and held its breath that the people
    on November 3 will vote against Clinton. </p>
    <p>It isn&#146;t clear how the Lewinsky government will work out. It only is clear the
    young intern has changed the history of the United States and the history of the world,
    and is in spirit even today at the levers of power of the U.S. government. </p>

 Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!  The government is being run by NBC, CBS and ABC and their treatment of Clinton is absolutely Hitlerian in its propaganda effect.  Night after night we have the obligatory Clinton on his way to or from a helicopter looking very presidential.  The obligatory wave, the turn at the cabinway.  The hand and hand with wife.  With the dog.  Without the dog.  It never stops.  Yet, he never says anything.  He never faces the American people.  The cowardly American press, as cowardly as Clinton himself, and the absolutely perfect representation of the Sixties Generation, offers its slavish approval.  From now on one thought should overpower all others when you see this propaganda at work:  HITLERIAN.  Clinton is the first to have a Goebbels and Rosenberg in every important media outlet.  There will be others to come.  <br>

 I don't see Monica having altered the history of the U.S....I see Bill Clinton as having..."changed the history of the
United States and the history of the world..." <p>
