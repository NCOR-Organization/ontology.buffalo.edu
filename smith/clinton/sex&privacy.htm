The Real Sexual<br>
McCarthyites Back Clinton</h2>

<p><i>By James Taranto, deputy features editor of the
Journal's editorial page.</i></p>
<p><b><font size="+3">E</font></b>ven in his darkest hour, Bill
Clinton's amazing political skills were on display. Who but our impeached
president could have brought together feminists and Larry Flynt, especially
on an issue involving sex? Last Thursday Mr. Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler magazine, joined Mr. Clinton's cause by "outing" would-be Speaker
Bob Livingston's sexual transgressions and threatening other Republicans
with the same treatment. Two days earlier, a gaggle of prominent feminists,
including Betty Friedan [<A HREF="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a367e57bd341a.htm">see '... you kinky wench</A>] and Eleanor Smeal, had descended on the Capitol,
where they declared their fidelity to the hustler in the White House.</p>
<p>Strange bedfellows indeed. But this convergence is not as surprising as
it seems, for contemporary feminists have a lot in common with
pornographers. Both are staunch opponents of Victorian hypocrisy and
traditional notions of morality and decency. Both have for years used the
legal system to wage war against sexual privacy. If we find ourselves in an
era of "sexual McCarthyism," feminists and pornographers deserve far more
of the blame than Ken Starr does.</p>
<p>Today's sexual climate owes a great deal to a pair of Supreme Court
cases: Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson (1986), which declared sexual
harassment a form of discrimination, and Miller v. California (1973), which
defined the limits of obscenity law. Each case introduced sex into an
important area of the law in a way that legislators could not have
anticipated.</p>
<p>In Meritor the court adopted the theory, developed by feminist legal
scholar Catharine MacKinnon in her 1979 book, "Sexual Harassment of Working
Women," that harassment is a form of sex discrimination actionable under
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This decision opened the door to
massive invasions of privacy by plaintiffs' lawyers seeking to establish
"patterns" of workplace sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>The inquisition Mr. Clinton faced at the hands of Paula Jones's lawyers
was no worse than what any defendant in a harassment case must endure. In
fact, as Monica Lewinsky discovered, alleged harassers aren't the only ones
who are subject to the intrusions of harassment law. Consider the plight of
Celia Farber, who had a consensual affair with her employer, Bob Guccione
Jr., son of the founder of Penthouse magazine. In 1994 Staci Bonner, an
ex-employee, sued Mr. Guccione, then the owner of Spin magazine, charging
him with harassment. In an effort to establish a pattern of favoritism
toward those who complied with Mr. Guccione's alleged advances, Ms.
Bonner's lawyers called Ms. Farber as a witness.</p>
<p>"Over a period of almost three years, I was subpoenaed for thousands of
pages of documentation, including every draft of every article I ever
wrote, my entire academic record, love letters, diaries and documentation
of any 'dates,' 'gifts' or any other physical remains of the affair," Ms.
Farber wrote last year in Salon, the online magazine whose scribes have
lately been vying with Mr. Flynt for the Pulitzer Prize in mud. "An
investigator called my first editor four or five times and asked him
whether he ever saw me and Bob touch each other, whether we ever left the
building together, whether we ever held hands."</p>
<p>Ms. Jones's lawyers similarly were trying to establish a pattern of
favoritism when they asked Mr. Clinton about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. It was harassment law that put the president in a position to lie
under oath and obstruct justice, the crimes for which he has been
impeached. If Mr. Clinton's defenders think his privacy has been violated,
they should complain to feminists and the Supreme Court, who made the
rules, not to Ms. Jones and Mr. Starr, who merely followed them.</p>
<p>Privacy's counterpart is discretion, a virtue that renders pornography
anathema. Pornography moves sex from the private realm of intimacy to the
public one of commerce. Of course, direct trade in sex--that is,
prostitution--is illegal everywhere save Nevada. But thanks to Miller,
commercial displays of sexual acts and organs, in print and on stage,
screen and Internet, are considered "expression," protected by the First
Amendment.</p>
<p>In theory, First Amendment protection of pornography is not absolute;
Miller held that obscenity, as defined by "community standards," may be
outlawed. But since any legislative assertion of community standards is
subject to judicial review, this qualification is at best a fig leaf,
ensuring endless lawsuits over attempts to restrict pornography. Such
litigation is a perverse morality play that pits local bluenoses against
self-proclaimed champions of free speech, often with preposterous results,
as in last month's federal court ruling that a public library in Virginia
must allow children access to Internet porn.</p>
<p>The imprimatur of the First Amendment allows a dealer in depravity like
Mr. Flynt to pose as a pious patriot, standing, as it were, on the
stepladder of the Constitution and pretending to occupy the moral high
ground. He practices intolerance while preaching tolerance, exposing the
peccadilloes of social conservatives, as if their weaknesses disproved
their principles. And journalists, those paragons of hardheaded skepticism,
fall for the hustle: On CNN's "Reliable Sources" Saturday, Jim Warren of
the Chicago Tribune lauded Mr. Flynt as "part of this wonderful continuum
in American journalism history of the mainstream media, a little bit staid,
being pushed to the fringes by newcomers."</p>
<p>If Meritor and Miller unleashed ugly forces in American society, one
must concede that there are arguments in their favor. It's easy to
sympathize with the desire for legal sanctions against workplace conduct
that is truly reprehensible--a governor of a small Southern state exposing
himself and demanding sexual favors from an unwilling low-level employee,
to take a hypothetical example. And obscenity laws have been used to
suppress legitimate artistic expression, such as James Joyce's
"Ulysses."</p>
<p>But sex is a complicated, mysterious and deeply private matter, one that
ought to be governed more by manners and morals than by laws. Harassment
law is a poor substitute for decency, First Amendment absolutism a poor
substitute for tolerance. Decency and tolerance are the cornerstones of
privacy; their decline is at the root of today's sexual McCarthyism.</p>
<p>Whatever Mr. Livingston's misdeeds and whatever his motives, his
resignation Saturday was an act of decency. By giving up power, he
reclaimed his privacy and spared his family, his party and his country
further embarrassment. Alas, at the White House, this is simply
incomprehensible. Just an hour after Mr. Livingston's announcement, Mr.
Clinton sent forth his press secretary, Joe Lockhart, to urge the would-be
speaker to reconsider. After he was impeached, Mr. Clinton himself emerged
to declare that he will never resign.</p>
<p>Of course he won't. It would be the decent thing to do.</p>

 Hey Republican leaders, if you don't come up with a counterattack to the sexual McCarthyites, there won't be a Republican party.  You better unleash your fire on Dodd, Kennedy, Daschle, Gephardt, Bonior, etc or you're all going to be outed, because the Dems have found a new tactic, not just for now but down the road.  You guys are like shooting ducks in the pond.  Plus your constituents aren't going to continue to back politicians who can't fight back.  I keep waiting for your responses but I know they won't come and the Dems know that also.<br>

 I'm afraid that 6 years of the Clintons, their "scorched earth" policy against Republicans, and the "Hollywood effect" have had the effect of  anesthetizing an already cynical public to any form of wrong doing, else Slick would never have been re-elected in the first instance. We are the worse for them, but "who cares" is now the order of the day.<br>

 Sad but true are your words. But I have another message also.
<P>
Since the democrats have proven they will tolerate anything, use any means to destroy an "enemy" and it's all justified, they have unleashed something they will live to regret mightly.
<P>
What ye sow, so shall ye reap. What has been done to others will come back to them many times over. 
<P>
Since ruthlessness is now the norm.. what makes them think THEY are safe. Someone will come along even more ruthless. They should have given careful thought to this.. <br>
