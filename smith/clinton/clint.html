<p><b>Presidential Teaching Tool</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Barry Smith
<br>&nbsp;
<p>'When I use a word,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'it means just what I choose
it to mean.' But Alice disagreed. The question, said Alice, 'is whether
you <i>can </i>make words mean so many different things.' Philosophers
have pondered Alice's question ever since, and they have generated a bewildering
variety of responses. One currently fashionable view, which we might call
the Humpty Dumpty theory, denies the existence of fixed word meanings altogether.
What words mean, say the defenders of this theory, is a matter of constant
flux, of fleeting mutual adjustments between the parties in a conversation
- a matter, in the end, of power ('The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty,
'which is to be master - that's all.') Against this is ranged the view
of those, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, who insist that if conversation,
and all the other basic elements of our social existence, are to be possible
at all, then there must be a widespread agreement in meanings and even
in judgments, a shared form of life to which all in society, whether they
recognize it or not, owe allegiance.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A legal deposition, too, is one of the basic figures of our social existence.
How are we to treat one who, in the context of such a deposition, tries
to make words mean just what he wants them to mean? Are we to conceive
him as someone who is just like everyone else (including his interlocutors),
in that he is using words as weapons in a struggle to guard his turf under
difficult and ever-shifting circumstances. Or are we to conceive such a
man as a type of Linguistic Deviant, analogous to someone who, in the middle
of a game of chess, rescues a losing position by setting fire to the chessboard?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the writings of philosophers such questions take on the technical
form of abstract theories. In the world of<b> </b>Bill Clinton they take
on life and color. Perhaps, then, our President could serve as a tool for
teaching philosophy - or so I reasoned when I was invited to teach an undergraduate
class as part of the University at Buffalo general education core under
the heading 'American Pluralism.' My colleagues had warned me, when I first
announced this class, that it would likely fall victim to Clinton-fatigue.
But the class has filled to capacity, with some 200 students, all of whom
seem to hold passionate views on the issues in hand. These issues are,
after all, on everyone's mind. And many of them - from lying to weakness
of will, from the nature of repentance to the meaning of 'is' - have been
subject to centuries of philosophical debate.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Philosophy should above all teach argument, the skills of reasoned analysis.
It should show students how to distinguish good from bad arguments, and
how to distinguish positions supported by cogent reasoning from beliefs
held on the basis of whims or feelings. The class began, accordingly, with
a brief introduction to logic, which included a treatment of arguments
<i>ad
hominem</i>, for example:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Bob Barr believes that Clinton is guilty
<p>Bob Barr gave a speech to a white supremacist audience
<p>Therefore, Clinton is innocent,
<br>&nbsp;
<p>and of why such arguments, which attempt to draw conclusions from the
behavior or personal qualities of the parties involved, must always fail.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next class concerned the question: <i>Can an awful person be a good
president? </i>On one side were those who pointed to figures from the past
who were awful people but great thinkers or artists. Heidegger, for example;
or Picasso; or Caravaggio (who killed a man over a game of tennis). To
be great in any field, this side maintained, might indeed <i>require</i>
that one be an awful person: the sheer devotion of energy and will and
manic selfishness that is required for greatness will surely necessitate
that one neglects one's friends and family and all the petty principles
of everyday life. Only an awful person, moreover, could bear the awful
load of presidential responsibility that is involved in time of war. On
the opposing side were those who insisted that trustworthiness and other
positive moral traits are necessary marks of a great president, since a
great president is one who can be relied upon to act morally precisely
under the most difficult conditions. A great president is one who, should
it become necessary, is in a position to call upon all of us to make sacrifices
for the common good.
<p>Other topics for debate include the issue of whether politicians deserve
support for their views when they do not live up to these views in their
actions. Would feminists still be right to support Clinton even admitting
his salacious treatment of women? And they include also the issue of 'consensual
behavior' in the context of the law of sexual harassment. The definition
of sex used at the President's deposition covers acts in which the deponent
'causes contact' with the [etc.] of 'any person.' As we read in the Starr
Report (footnote 96):
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When he testified to the grand jury, the President said that this aspect
of the definition still does not cover his receiving oral sex. The President
said that the word "cause" implies "forcing to me" and "forcible abusive
behavior." ... thus the President said that he did not lie under oath in
denying that he "caused" contact with the [etc.] of any person because
his activity with Ms. Lewinsky did not include any nonconsensual behavior.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Indeed the feminist defense of Clinton turns precisely on the thesis
that Monica Lewinsky consented, freely, to their embranglements. But there
are profound issues afoot here. When is an action free and when coerced?
Let us imagine a possible world in which some powerful man is completely
irresistible to every single woman he meets. (Philosophers have a special
license to consider thought-experiments such as this.) Would the notion
of 'willing consent' be applicable at all in the case of the women who
come into contact with such a man? Would not his every contact with members
of the opposite sex be <i>ipso facto</i> a case of sexual harassment? (One
female graduate student to whom I posed this problem answered: <i>bring
me such a man!</i>) The puzzle has, of course, an equal and opposite counterpart
if we switch the genders. And the oft-repeated scenes in ancient dramas
involving hypnotic powers and magic potions suggest that it draws on anxieties
deeply rooted in the human condition.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>One particularly heated class debate considered the proposition: <i>a
president should serve as a role model for the nation</i>. On the one side
were those who saw role models in terms of identity politics. How, on this
basis, could a white male president ever serve as role model for someone
who is black or female? Role models are people you can identify with. On
the other side were those who saw role models in moral terms. Role models
are ideals or exemplars. They are people, like George Washington or Mother
Teresa, who are above the normal run. Surely, the first side argued, people
in a mature society should be allowed and encouraged to take their role
models from wherever they see fit. It is not the president's job to serve
in this capacity. His job, rather, is simply to do his job. From the other
side, however, came the insistence that the president will, for better
or worse, have moral effects on society, even if only as a function of
his high visibility. In this he is no different from Michelle Pfeiffer
or Sylvester Stallone. Thus he should strive, surely, to serve as role
model in the positive sense, by adhering to the highest possible ethical
standards. Ronald Reagan recognized something of this when he refused even
to remove his jacket in the Oval Office. But then a third group, of loud
males, entered into the debate, and brought the discussion to a boil. President
Clinton is, they insisted, an exemplar. He
<i>is</i> someone above the
normal run. He is the Ideal of Testosterone, a role model for the morality
of: <i>letting it all hang out</i>.
