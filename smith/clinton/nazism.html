Before
senators vote to acquit a president who has degraded our highest political
office and the law of the land, they should sit down together with Christabel
Bielenberg's story of life in National Socialist Germany.

<P>In 1934, Christabel
Burton, an Englishwoman, married Peter Bielenberg, a German lawyer. They
settled in Hamburg and over the next years experienced the breakdown of
German law and institutions. In 1969, Christabel Bielenberg told their
story in her book, "The Past Is Myself," which was resurrected 20 years
later on Masterpiece Theatre as "Christabel."

<P>Adolph Hitler's
National Socialists had a more difficult time reshaping Germany to suit
themselves than Lenin's Communists experienced in Russia. The Czar's government
in Russia, although highly bureaucratized, was a personal form of government.
Its rationale and power flowed from the Czar. When the Czar and his family
were murdered by the Communists, his government ceased to exist, thereby
providing the Communists with a clean slate.

<P>In contrast,
German government institutions were independent of party and person. The
National Socialists had to contend for a while with independent law and
courts and accustomed practices that frustrated their aims.

<P>Hitler's government
responded by ignoring inconvenient court decisions, by putting in place
a parallel court system, and by replacing traditional law with its own
administrative orders. As time passed, fear mounted as new legal terms
appeared that cloaked lawlessness with language such as "protective custody,"
"People's Court" and "offense against the natural healthy instinct of the
people."

<P>After building
fear with arbitrary power, the National Socialists were able to force people
step by step into compromise with their integrity and complicity with evil.

<P>The Hitlerization
of Germany was achieved by accustoming the population to a gradual degradation
of law and morals until people shuffled for the National Socialists the
way prisoners, deprived of shoelaces, shuffle in their shoes.

<P>At this moment
nothing but an uncertain Senate stands between us and the degradation of
our civic life by the Clintons.

<P>Clinton has
already corrupted the media, which shuffles for him.

<P>Clinton has
corrupted the Democrats in the House of Representatives, who shuffle for
him.

<P>And now Bill
Clinton and his government are betting that the U.S. Senate will shuffle
for him. Fearful of its constitutional duty, the Senate is already shuffling
toward an extra-constitutional compromise that will add to our degradation.

<P>Just as many
Germans did not comprehend where the shuffle was leading until it was too
late, many Americans are not aware of the implications of excusing the
country's chief executive from perjury and obstruction of justice.

<P>If Clinton
remains in office, the precedent will be established that the president
is above some laws in some circumstances. Caesar will have crossed the
Rubicon. The laws, above which the president sits, will increase in number
with time, and other executive branch officials will gradually acquire
by extension the distinction of being higher than law.

<P>Indeed, the
executive branch is already filled with little dictators. Wherever one
looks, one sees administrative agencies behaving as if they are legislative
bodies. Clinton's EPA is attempting to force the recall of federally certified
Toyota/Lexus vehicles based on the issuance of a retroactive standard.

<P>Clinton's
Justice Department is using coerced consent degrees to establish illegal
and unconstitutional racial quotas as the law of the land.

<P>Clinton's
Treasury, Justice, State and Interior Departments are using executive orders
and abusing their regulatory authority in order to gradually criminalize
gun ownership.

<P>Clinton's
appointees are exercising power without being confirmed in office by the
Senate, and Clinton's executive branch departments are implementing treaties
that have not been ratified by the Senate.

<P>Federal prosecutors
fabricate cases in order to meet conviction quotas for "white collar crimes,"
"environmental crimes" and drug crimes.

<P>After a two-year
investigation of prosecutorial misconduct, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
concluded: "Perjury has become the coin of the realm in federal law enforcement."

<P>How is perjury
to be rooted out of federal law enforcement when it cannot be rooted out
of the White House?

<P>If the president
can obstruct justice in order to hide sexual misconduct, a prosecutor can
obstruct justice in order to hide misconduct that would exonerate a defendant.

<P>Fair trials
will disappear, and our civil rights will shuffle off the stage.

<P>Before Senators
shuffle for Clinton, they should add up the stakes.
