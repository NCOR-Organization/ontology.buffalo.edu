<font size=+1><b>Clinton's Message to Women</b></font><p>
<b> Village Voice</b><br><b>1/20/99</b>
 <em>Nat Hentoff</em>
 <br><font size=+0><p><hr><font size=+3><font color=bllue><u><center>Clinton's Message to Women</font></font></u></center><hr><b><i><center>'Clinton ripped [Jane Doe No. 5's] clothes and bit her lip' </i></b></center><p><font color=bllue><font size=+1>P</font></font>articipating in December's Emergency Speakout Against Impeachment at NYU were some of this area's prominent intellectuals and moral philosophers—among them, Arthur Schlesigner Jr., Toni Morrison, Eli Wiesel, Gloria Steinem, and Jerold Nadler who, alas, is my congressman. There were spiraling cries of "sexual McCarthyism" and "coup d'&eacute;tat!"
<P>And in the January 10 <I>New York Times</I>, Gerold Lefcourt, a Clinton advocate, states baldly that Clinton's <I>defense</I> witnesses have been intimidated. Let's see <I>who</I> has been intimidated.
<P>Lefcourt, a prominent attorney, ignores the series of women who have been threatened by Clinton and his agents to keep their silence about his exercising his droit du seigneur on their bodies.
<P>It is this relentless obstruction of justice that I began to detail last week. Also on the list of Clinton's throwaway women who should have been placed in the federal Witness Protection Program is Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Arkansas's former Miss America, who had a brief bout of intimacy with Clinton in 1983. During the 1992 presidential campaign she received calls to keep quiet about it—or else.
<P>But just in case she faltered—as the <I>Wall Street Journal Europe</I> (October 27, 1998)<BR>
reported—her agent met with Clinton buddy Harry Tomason and Clinton advisor Mickey Kantor and "worked out some kind of deal." She would deny any relationship with Clinton and her career would benefit.
<P>She obeyed, but when she was subpoenaed in the Paula Jones case, the threatening calls resumed. She has told <I>The Toronto Sun</I>, according to <I>The Washington Times</I>: "I think Clinton is a very dangerous manipulative man. There was a lot of pressure on my family and friends, people who were being staked out."
<P>Moving on, the <I>Wall Street Journal Europe</I> reveals the post–<I>60 Minutes</I> ordeal of Kathleen Willey.
<P>Two days before she was scheduled to testify in the Paula Jones case, "A man in a jogging suit approached her while she was out for a walk near her Virginia home. He asked about a missing family pet [her cat]. The jogger mentioned Willey's children by name. 'Don't you get the message?' he asked her."
<P>Dolly Kyle Browning, another former Clinton bonbon, and now a Texas real estate attorney, has filed a defamation suit against William Jefferson Clinton and, among his retainers, Bruce Lindsey.
<P>In her court papers, Browning tells of an extramarital sexual relationship with Clinton from the mid 1970s to "sometime before January 1992," when Clinton was eyeing the prize of the presidency.
<P>In January of that year, <I>The Star</I>, a tabloid weekly, was about to print a story about that idyll. Browning refused to be interviewed, but Clinton was taking no chances.
<P>In her complaint in the lawsuit, she says that her own brother, Walter Kyle, acting on behalf of—or at the direction of—Clinton, warned her that "if you cooperate with the media, we will destroy you." At the time, her solicitous brother was working in the Clinton campaign in New Hampshire.
<P>Two years later, according to the court papers, she and Clinton made a deal—using Clinton's confidential aide, Bruce Lindsey, as an intermediary. She would not tell the truth about their relationship if he promised not to tell any lies about her.
<P>But when Browning decided to write a romance novel, a roman &agrave; clef about their intimacy, and word got out in <I>Publishers Weekly</I>, Clinton "acting individually and through various agents... conspired to prevent the publication of her manuscript." (Browning court papers.)
<P>The conspiracy involved "threatening and intimidating Mrs. Browning and potential publishers... and defaming Mrs. Browning."
<P>In a March 6, 1998, affidavit, Browning testified that she and her former lover met in the summer of 1994 at their 30th high school reunion in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
<P>"I reminded Billy," Browning said in the affidavit, "that he had threatened to destroy me and he said he was sorry." She was pleased to get, at last, his apology.
<P>Then there is Linda Tripp. <I>The Wall Street Journal Europe</I> reports: "Mrs. Tripp says that Bruce Lindsey told her she would be 'destroyed' if she went public with criticism of the White House. Mr. Lindsey's lawyer denies this was a threat. However, Monica Lewinsky, conveying what Ms. Tripp took to be a message from the White House, told Tripp that she had 'two children to think about' and that talking to the press was 'a dangerous thing to do.'"
<P>Juanita Broaddrick is another woman whom feminists Gloria Steinem, Patricia Ireland, and Betty Friedan have somehow forgotten to tell us about. Lisa Myers, who has broken a number of stories for NBC, reported on March 28, 1998, that Paula Jones's lawyer had filed court papers saying that Clinton, in 1978, while attorney general of Arkansas, had "forcibly raped and assaulted" Broaddrick in a Little Rock hotel room, and then "bribed and intimidated her" to keep that indelible experience to herself.
<P>Myers added: "NBC News has talked to four people from Arkansas who say Broaddrick told them of such an assault years ago." According to one source, Clinton "ripped her clothes and bit her lip."
<P>The White House says that Broaddrick has denied under oath that she was ever raped by Clinton, but the story will not die. On CNBC's <I>Hardball</I>, Chris Matthews asked Congresswoman Tillie Fowler (Republican, Florida), if members of the Republican caucus were willing to read material (in files not open to the public) that accuses the president of rape almost 20 years ago. And, Matthews added, "they have got some documentation." (The reference was to Jane Doe No. 5, Juanita Broaddrick.)
<P>Broaddrick's lawyer, Bill Walters, says, "We're not confirming or denying anything."
<P>According to <I>The Starr Report</I>, when Broaddrick was interviewed by FBI investigators, she admitted that her affidavit denying the rape was false. (See page 58, Jane Doe No. 5, footnote 203.)

 Nat Hentoff has the misfortune of being an intellectually honest liberal.  A very difficult trick on a good day.  BTW the old chestnut about the three greatest lies in American life has been attributed to Nat:<p><p>

1. The Check's in the mail.<p><p>

2. Black is Beautiful.<p><p>

3. I promise not to do [what Clinton did to Monica's dress] in your mouth.

 Hentoff has always been an honest man.  That's why he's speaking out.<p>
Put him on the list of honest liberals like Schippers, Zeifman, Ruth and Ben Jones.  The fact that this list is so short speaks volumes about the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Left.<br>

Well, I for one don't like him, and Hentoff is my kind of liberal for sure.  He's very pro-life too, and doesn't hesitate to call the Democrat turncoats on that issue (including the REVEREND Jesse Jackson) the hypocrites they are. <br>

 Judy - look closely and you will see Bruce Lindsay (or as
the New York Times calls him today ("the discreet Mr.Lindsay")seated at the President's defense table in the well of the Senate. Guess he'll have a front row seat when his heavily rumored girl-friend Cheryl Mills does her thing this week. Now there is someone who knows about lying under oath.<br>

 Trixie, Dolly Kyle Browning said that her brother relayed a threat from the Clinton camp, yet I have seen no information that Starr, or others, have ever sought her brother's testimony to help establish a pattern of obstruction. WHY????  Someone working for the boy president asked Walter Kyle to deliver the threat, if it is true.<br>
