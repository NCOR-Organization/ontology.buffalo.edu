<FONT SIZE=+3>Legal Realism</FONT>
<BR>Ben Stein: Horrible impeachment process
<BR><I>USA Today</I> December 15, 1998

<P>Now for a few words from outside the Beltway about the impeachment hearings
that became like a screen saver on my TV in recent days. First, when I
was at Yale Law School, oh, some 30 years ago or more, we learned that
Yale was the cradle of "legal realism.'' That doctrine, created by the
likes of Harold Lasswell, Myers McDougal, and Karl Llewellyn (who was not
at Yale), said that judges did not use legal precedents or statutory interpretation
to make their rulings. Instead, they just decided what side of a case they
liked, then found the cases and language to justify a decision they had
already made based on their political, class, ethnic or other views - or
just on how much they liked one lawyer's necktie.

<P>The law - as the legal realists said - was not abstract, but decided
by men with prejudices and biases like any other group of humans, then
rationalized with cases and precedents (but there are always precedents
on either side of a big case). The power of this proposition has become
devastatingly clear in the Clinton impeachment hearings. By and large,
and with no exceptions that I have seen, the Democrats, and especially
the most militant Democrats, can find "logic,'' "fact,'' and "precedent''
to excuse Clinton, and to trivialize what Clinton did and said. The GOP,
with exactly as much precision, can find "logic,'' "fact,'' and "precedent''
to impeach Clinton.

<P>This leaves the consideration of important legal issues, even issues
as big as impeaching a president, as highly personal, and therefore political
matters. Don't even expect for a minute that it's going to change. Rep.
Robert Wexler, D-Fla., is not going to convince Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is not going to make Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
change to a lover of Clinton. The life of the law is not logic, but experience,
as was carved above the door of the Yale Law School, and experience tells
us people make laws and legal decisions and that those people are a lot
like us.

<P>I happen to think the logic and fact and precedent favor a stinging
impeachment of Clinton. But if my wife were his general counsel, I would
feel differently. That's human nature. Legal realism just gives it a name
as it applies to law. Hear talk not clank of tank treads But there is also
something truly magnificent going on in Washington right now, something
much bigger than legal realism. Or rather, it's what's not going on. The
truly noble sound that came out of Washington in the past few months, and
is still coming out of Congress and talk shows, is talk, talk, talk, not
the clank, clank, clank of tank treads. Disputes are being handled - if
not resolved - by debate, however sharp. No one is calling up troops. No
one is machine-gunning opponents. Correspondents are not being shot in
the head, as in Moscow or in Dublin.

<P>The House is set to debate whether to send a bill of impeachment over
to the Senate. But if the House votes to send the referral to the Senate,
not a soul doubts that the troops and tanks will not intervene and that
there will be no organized violence. If the president is convicted, he
will immediately leave office. No one imagines that he will call up the
101st Airborne to keep him in the White House. No one doubts for a second
that if the president is acquitted he will not have his opponents arrested
and put in prison. Disputes about law, even at the top level of governance,
will not be settled by violence.

<P>Above parsing, Constitution's magnificence

<P>There are masses of human squabbling and some miserable logic-chopping
and hair-splitting and some embarrassing evasions, some heroism and some
cravenness in the debate about Clinton's past and future. But over it all
is truly magnificent self-restraint braced by what one 19th century British
Prime Minister termed "the most remarkable work to have been produced by
the human intellect" - the U.S. Constitution. Whatever we think of Clinton
or Ken Starr or Nadler or Hyde, the GOP majority or the Democrat minority,
and whatever lies ahead for Clinton, that is worth celebrating. Ben Stein,
a former Nixon administration official, is a writer, actor and host of
Comedy Central's 'Win Ben Stein's Money.' He also is a member of USA TODAY's
board of contributors.
