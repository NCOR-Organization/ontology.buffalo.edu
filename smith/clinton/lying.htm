<p><b><font size=+1>Our children imitate a president who lies</font></b>
<p><b>Providence Journal</b>
<br><b>December 3, 1998</b> <i>MARK PATINKIN</i>
<p><font size=+0><a href="http://www.projo.com/">Providence Journal</a></font>
<p><font size=+0>Until this week, I was on the president's side. Ken Starr
was the bad guy, wasting millions investigating behavior that seemed nobody's
business. It was sordid for Mr. Clinton to have such a tryst, and apparently
lie about it, but how has that hurt the country?</font>
<p><font size=+0>I'm beginning to see.</font>
<p><font size=+0>It's about children.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Here is a letter from a reader named Pete McVety:</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``My 10-year-old son used the President's actions as
an excuse the other day. I asked if he had practiced the trombone. He said
`yes </i>. <i>' I knew that he had not since I had been home all day, so,
I told him `How could you say that?' He replied, `You didn't ask me if
I had practiced today, only, if I had practiced, and I have, just not today.'
I asked how he could possibly think his answer acceptable and he replied,
`It's just what the President does on TV. I answered just like he does.'
What can you say to that? I said, `You have to be better than the President.
Just because he did it, doesn't make it right.' ''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>This is the second column I've written on this. The first
was about a karate instructor who confronted a 15-year-old student for
getting a girl pregnant, and heard this response: Clinton gets away with
things, so why shouldn't he?</font>
<p><font size=+0>Was that attitude common? I asked readers if any had similar
stories.</font>
<p><font size=+0>This one is from Don Giannatti of Phoenix, Ariz.:</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``I am the father of three girls. My oldest is 12.
As my daughter was trying to fake her way through a story about `missing'
homework, the lies were beginning to mount. Her frustration at being grilled
and caught was palpable. Then she told me what happened: It wasn't all
her fault, she explained, if the `stupid teacher hadn't caught me, I wouldn't
be in all this trouble.' Nearing exasperation I explained that the accuser
isn't necessarily the wrong party. `Well, everyone on the morning show
today said it was that Starr guy that got Clinton in trouble.' She was
serious. I was sad.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Usually, I get a half-dozen or so responses to a column.
Fifteen is high. In this case, between E-mail and phone calls, I got more
than 100. That's off the charts. And I've yet to get responses by regular
mail. The <i>Journal </i>is on the Web, and my column runs in a few other
papers, but not many, so the response from around the country surprised
me, too.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Here's an E-mail from a reader named Gary, signed with
the initials ``GLG'':</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``I teach in a suburban San Francisco high school.
Our school populace is largely Latino and Filipino. No one has ever confused
me with conservative thinkers. With all that said, I wish you could spend
a day with me if you really want to see the scandal's impact firsthand.
With many students it's now an `anything goes' world, and Clinton is their
reference/alibi.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>To be fair, about half the replies seemed to be from Clinton-haters.
They quickly veered off the subject of children to attack him across the
board.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Others stayed focused on children, but in a non-anecdotal
way, as with this phone call: <i>``I'm a nearly 60-year-old grandmother
with a 10-year-old grandson and granddaughter and it scares me to death
that they will think that lying and the behavior of the president is an
acceptable way of life as they come into their teenage years. </i>''</font>
<p><font size=+0>Many parents said Mr. Clinton's conduct has forced their
young children to deal with inappropriate sexual subjects.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Julianne Ip, associate dean of medicine at Brown University
was among them.</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``I have a 7-year-old,'' </i>she wrote. <i>``He has
asked me about oral sex, stains on dresses, perjury, and a host of other
things I had hoped my son would not have to learn about when he should
be out shooting hoops, riding his bike and enjoying what we all worked
so hard to provide . . . a great country to grow up in.''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>Philip Moen has four daughters, ages 3, 5, 7 and 11.</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``When the news first broke,'' </i>he wrote, <i>``the
7-year-old was most inquisitive, asking questions like, `Did Clinton sex
Lewinsky?', `Does Clinton love another woman besides his wife?' ''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>And a male caller offered this story:</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``My daughter, 10 years old, A-student, from a good
family, good kid, was caught in a lie. Not normal behavior, but her response
was: `It's not like I had an affair or anything, Daddy.' It totally blew
me away.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Even parents of older children felt this way. Dana Swift
is a mother from Traverse City, Mich.</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``My 18-year-old,'' </i>she wrote, <i>``asked if this
kind of thing happens at my workplace because pro-Clinton people act like
this is normal behavior. I had to assure him that any other CEO would be
fired on the spot and escorted off the premises. I am heartbroken about
the negative impact Clinton has had on my kids.''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>There was even one letter mourning the impact on young
people over 18. It came from Thomas A. Young, and has a special credibility
given his work.</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``I am a training officer in the U.S. Marine Corps,''
</i>he wrote. <i>``And, yes, I have heard `kids' talk that way. The `kids'
I'm referring to are 18-to-20-year-old Marines. All they know is that their
commander in chief is getting away with conduct for which they would be
court-martialed. And people in positions of authority are saying it's O.K.
How can I teach my Marines that Honor, Courage and Commitment are worthwhile
values, while you give a pass to the president for his actions? I hold
my Marines accountable for their actions. I am held accountable for my
actions. So are you, I would imagine. Yet, the president shouldn't be?
Please, explain to me, so I can explain to the next Marine I have to discipline,
why he should be accountable, but the president should not. And please
explain why the </i>` <i>Cop </i>' <i>is the bad guy?''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>The majority of the replies, however, focused on specific
examples of children justifying bad behavior by saying <i>: </i>Clinton
does it, so why shouldn't they?</font>
<p><font size=+0>Keith Preston is from St. Louis.</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``I work in a private school in the Midwest . . . here,
the kids call it `pulling a Clinton.' Also known as `deny, deny, deny .
. . lie, lie, lie.' Our children look for examples, especially ones set
by men who are powerful, popular, and looked up to. All we are saying is
that if you lie CONTINUOUSLY, and without remorse, then your society will
pay the price. And I tell you I see it every day.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Nick Carver is from Columbus, Ohio:</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``I have a 13-year-old stepson with behavioral disabilities;
honesty has been something we have worked very hard to instill. This weekend
he used the `presidential excuse.' He used terminology right from the evening
news, only my wife and I were the prosecutors.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Mary Williams called to say it's now harder for her husband
and her to teach their three children that lying has consequences:</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``They have pointed out `Then why can the president
lie, how come he won't get in trouble?' We say that he has a lot of people
protecting him. Well, they feel that if their friends protect them in a
lie then they, too, should get away with it.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Sharon Sammartino teaches confirmation students.</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``This is the kind of response I've gotten also,''
</i>she said. <i>`` `If it's okay for the president of the United States,
why isn't it okay for kids, and why do you teach us not to be like that,
and yet he can do it and it's okay?' ''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>The president had a few thoughtful defenders. They said
that taking children seriously when they use a ``Clinton-did-it defense''
is a cop-out by parents who fail to set standards themselves.</font>
<p><font size=+0><i>``To me,'' </i>said a woman caller, <i>``this is just
another situation where a child misbehaves and we blame it on something
else. Society as a whole has got to start taking responsibility.''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>A caller named Polly Stiness said her 11 grandchildren
show that Mr. Clinton's impact is minimal: <i>``The young ones neither
understand nor do they have the remotest interest in all those revolting
revelations from Washington, via Judge Starr. They're NOT INTERESTED. Are
they using that as some kind of excuse for their own bad behavior? Of course
not!''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>But most who responded felt differently.</font>
<p><font size=+0>There was Paul Marshall, who teaches at the John Casablancas
modeling agency in Warwick. ``These kids look to us for some sort of leadership,''
he said. <i>``A lot of these kids, they think that what our fearless leader
did is acceptable. And I see it every day.''</i></font>
<p><i><font size=+0>There was the male caller who said his girlfriend has
been having trouble with her 14-year-old because of Mr. Clinton: He tells
his mom to ``get off his back'' -- the president gets away with things,
so what's the big deal?</font></i>
<p><i><font size=+0>Finally, a man called with an anecdote about his 12-year-old
nephew: ``He got caught lying about something,'' </font></i><font size=+0>the
man said, <i>``just typical 12-year-old stuff. And he looked at my sister
and said, `You're getting upset at me, when the president's up there arguing
about what ``is'' is. And you don't get mad at him.' ''</i></font>
<p><font size=+0>The man added a final observation:</font>
<p><i><font size=+0>``All the kids hear is everyone putting down the prosecutor,
and the person who lied is being defended. Just think what that will do
years down the road as these kids get older, if that's the base they're
starting out at. Will they have any respect for the law and about lying?
I think it's going to have consequences that a lot of us aren't even thinking
of.''</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Until this week, I was on the president's side. How had
his behavior hurt the country?</font>
<p><font size=+0>I'm beginning to see.</font>
