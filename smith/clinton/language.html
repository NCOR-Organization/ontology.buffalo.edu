<b><font size=+2>WORDS FOR AMORAL AMERICA</font></b></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>By DAVID GELERNTER</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>OUR language shows the character of our thinking, like a
pond surface</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>transmitting disturbances below.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>A Democratic senator announced recently that he ''didn't
agree'' with</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>some of the president's behavior (although naturally he was
opposed to</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>conviction on the impeachment charges). Now you can ''disagree''
with a</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>proposition, but not an action. It makes no sense to say
''I agreed with</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>the president at first, when he walked his dog; when he fell
down the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>stairs, I disagreed with that.''</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>But of course it's easier to ''disagree'' with a man than
disapprove of</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>him. Disagreement is morally neutral. The judge doesn't tell
the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>defendant ''The jury has found you guilty, and I disagree
with your</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>crimes. I therefore sentence you to ... '' The priest doesn't
tell the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>penitent in the confessional ''I disagree with your sins,
and</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>accordingly ... '' At least I don't think he does.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>This senator was talking the new language of American amorality.
He was</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>a good spokesman for a society that is in steady retreat
from the idea</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>of duty.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) laid it on the line in an interview
that is</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>already passing into legend and will one day be recounted
in history</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>books. He explained that, yes, the president was guilty of
impeachable</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>crimes - but he should not be (or at any rate could not be)
convicted</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>and removed because he is popular and the economy is strong.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>I'm sure many other senators think the same thing but don't
have the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>courage to admit it. Henceforth any defendant should be allowed
to plead</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>''not guilty by reason of popularity,'' and criminal lawyers
will have</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>to study up on the Soaring Dow defense.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>When the murderer O.J. Simpson was acquitted and set free,
most</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Americans assumed that the verdict was a fantastic anomaly.
Many white</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Americans assumed also that it was a piece of ugly, vicious
racism on</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>the part of a black jury. Today they owe the Simpson jury
an apology, of</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>sorts. No less an authority than the U.S. Senate has endorsed
the idea</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>that if the facts say ''guilty!'' you are duty-bound to convict
-</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>assuming you feel up to it. Otherwise, never mind.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>The Simpson jury evidently reasoned: ''It doesn't matter
whether this</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>man is innocent or guilty; we don't want to convict him.
Some people</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>regard him as a hero. We hate his accusers. And we'd be unpopular
with</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>our neighbors if we voted to bring him down.'' Many congressional</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Democrats seem to feel the same way about the president.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Of course there is a large moral difference between Clinton's
crimes and</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Simpson's. I assume that if the president's crimes had been
truly</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Simpsonian, even Sen. Byrd would have favored conviction.
But I'm not</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>sure where the switch-over would take place. Once you are
cleared to</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>commit obstruction of justice and perjury, what other crimes
can you get</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>away with? There's a thought to cheer a president on a rainy
day.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>What have we learned? Where does impeachment leave us? It
leaves us</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>(speaking for southern New England) on a pale day threatening
snow, with</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>a pair of solemn mallards cruising a forest pond.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>I visited the pond a few days ago with my boys, and we watched</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>contentedly for a long time as nothing happened. The outcome
of the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>impeachment trial merely reflects (like the pond reflecting
bare</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>branches) the nation's spiritual emptiness. The president
himself,</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>having no character of his own, reflects the nation's mood
like a</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>mirror. (He is famous for reading an audience and adjusting
his tone</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>accordingly.) He has made the White House small, mean and
cheap, but</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>eventually it will recover - when the nation does.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>In the meantime, there is this pond reminding us of the once
and future</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>dignity of the United States of America, and preserving a
small piece of</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>it. Now is a good time for ducks and quiet.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>A NEWS story over the weekend made such a strange assertion,
I had to</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>read it three times to make sure I had understood it. Ultimately
it's a</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>good indication of our state of mind. The National Archives
in</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Washington has determined that the Declaration of Independence,
the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Constitution and the Bill of Rights (the actual parchment
originals)</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>need new cases; otherwise they might suffer long-term damage.
Fair</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>enough. Musing on the Founding Fathers and the Declaration,
the New York</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Times said this: ''Surely few thought that the text they
wrote would</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>survive for more than two centuries.''</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Why should they have doubted that their parchment text ''would
survive</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>for more than two centuries''? Many medieval manuscripts
survive today,</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>and they were all on hand in 1776 - housed mainly in Europe;
but the</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Founding Fathers were worldly, cultivated men.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>I can only guess that this news story projects onto 1776
the world-view</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>of today's cultural leaders. Most old parchment texts are
religious</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>documents, but editors and reporters rarely think about religion,
or</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>medieval manuscripts - and they assume that the Founding
Fathers</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>approached life on the same basis.</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>&nbsp;</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>Today's cultural leaders rarely take words seriously, or
choose them</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>carefully, or expect them to last - and they can barely imagine
men who</font></dt>

<dt>
<font size=+0>did.</font></dt>
