<p><b><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Brent Gregston
reports from Amsterdam:</font></font></b>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+2>T</font><font size=+1>hanks
to globalization, Europeans and Americans are now divided by a common culture.
They read the same news, only with different emotions. Europeans cannot
stop laughing at Clinton any more than they could stop crying in the days
following the death of Princess Diana. After looking down on it for so
long, they have plunged headlong into the American media circus. Clinton's
one-man show is receiving equal time with the worst terrorist act in Irish
history and the collapse of Russia's currency.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Amsterdam and all
of Europe's other capitals are hard-wired to the Clinton sex life -- except
for Moscow, where people are forming lines several miles long to change
their rubles into dollars. Clinton is the world's most powerful leader,
the gendarme du monde and the most joked about man in Europe's several
dozen languages. Once, Europeans struggled to understand. Now they have
given up and humor is their weapon of last resort.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>For an American in
Europe, it is all very embarrassing. My wife, an architect, spent the day
trying to avoid her Dutch colleagues. "I'm sick of it," she said. "I'm
the only American in the office and they surrounded me. They're laughing
at us all the time. They say the Clinton scandal is ridiculous but never
talk about anything else."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>"What sort of anatomy
do Americans learn in school?" they asked her, over and over again.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Clinton has become
the man with a thousand epithets. "Clinton's an asshole," a TV producer
told me, "but a great liar -- in other words, a good politician." I asked
how he would he feel if Wim Kok, the Dutch prime minister, confessed to
having oral sex with a 21-year-old intern?</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>"At his age? We'd
all be proud of him."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Clinton is also a
"Gobshite, a wanker and a cutehoor" according to an Irish curator who works
in Holland. "I wanted to stay up till 3 a.m. just to see him cringe on
television."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>"So, he should resign?"
I asked.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>"Are you kidding?"
he responded. "He's pro-choice."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>American euphemisms
don't work any better in translation than in the original. The Dutch for
Clinton's inappropriate behavior -- <i>onbetamelijke fysieke relaties</i>
-- sounds more like a mutation of the Ebola virus than oral pleasure. German
<i>unangemessene Beziehung</i> also falls short of onomatopoeia. No wonder
that many European editors prefer to use the word "blow-job" untranslated
in their articles and editorials. The French <i>relations d&eacute;plac&eacute;es</i>
makes perfect sense when illustrated by a cartoon of Clinton in the French
daily Lib&eacute;ration: He has his fly open and is flashing an Achilles
heel in place of a penis.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Of course, Europeans
are not only laughing. The Dutch, ever practical, worry about the economic
fallout from Clinton's Achilles penis. Stockbrokers complain the market
would be a hundred points higher if it were not for Clinton. On Monday
afternoon, they crowded around a Bloomberg terminal in the stock exchange
hoping for details of Clinton's grand jury testimony. My neighbor, a housewife,
seems to share their resentment: "We'll be in a recession tomorrow if we
fire everyone who's had sex in the workplace."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Laughter often ends
in disgust. Europeans recoiled from their cable television screens when
CNN used the word "historic" to describe Clinton's broadcast. "What sort
of history do Americans learn in school?" the Dutch are asking me, over
and over again.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>In an editorial today,
Amsterdam's leading newspaper, Het Parool, suggests that Clinton could
still salvage a place in history by doing something about the crisis in
Russia. The fall of the ruble threatens to plunge the country with the
world's largest nuclear arsenal into anarchy. Reminding us that there is
more to worry about in the world than antics in the White House, the newspaper
notes a disturbing resemblance between this crisis and a truly historic
event: the collapse of the German mark in the 1920s, which destroyed a
fledgling democratic government and brought about Hitler's rise to power.</font></font>

<br><b><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>From Gentry Lane
in Paris:</font></font></b>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+2>T</font><font size=+1>oday
was the first day that "Le Clinton-Lewinsky Scandale Sexuel" beat smog
reports as the top story on French television news coverage. Once French
foreign correspondents rattled off the facts of Clinton's public and court
appeals, the cameras turned back on Paris and the American community embedded
within. The French seem infinitely more curious about the American public's
fascination with the Clinton scandal and the surrounding media feast than
with the actual events that started the whole hullabaloo.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Harry's New York Bar,
which has been an American watering hole since World War I, carried full
coverage of Clinton's public speech on a television perched up in the corner.
Expatriates gathered to watch and drink, while French news cameras waited
to catch their reactions. When asked, Americans were quick to state their
moral opposition to Clinton's illicit conduct.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>It was the sure-fire
thing to say in order to get on TV. And it worked.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>French news coverage
did not feature any Americans who claimed indifference or even amusement
about the situation at hand. Apathy and suppressed laughter were left to
impromptu person-on-the-street interviews. Every Parisian interviewed essentially
said that they didn't understand and/or didn't care about all the fuss.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>With regard to the
print media, the French, who are eternally more interested in themselves,
have given the Clinton scandal a surprising share of ink. Le Figaro, one
of the more reliable Parisian newspapers, put Clinton on the front page,
although his photo was dwarfed by the one announcing the death of writer
Julien Green. An accompanying article listed statistics regarding public
opinion polls and a quick recap of the grand jury confession. Three-quarters
of the third page was devoted to background information under such titillating
titles as <i>"sexe, mensonges et video"</i> -- "Sex, Lies and Videotape."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>In general, the French
seem to be sympathetic to Clinton and the humiliation of his predicament,
while they regard the whole scandal as ridiculous. Columnist Franz-Oliver
Giesbert led his Figaro front-page column declaring that one "doesn't know
whether to laugh or cry" for Clinton.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>For the French, of
course, presidential sexual behavior ranks considerably lower on the list
of priorities. Former French President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand's <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/media/1998/07/21media.html" target="_top">illegitimate
daughter</a> merely raised eyebrows. Chatty salon gossip ensued, but any
French opposition to their president's indiscretions elicited a far cry
from the frenzied state that the American press and public seem to be in.
Although it's impossible to generalize about the moral codes of an entire
country, nobody will disagree with the fact that the French (despite their
largely Catholic population) are more liberal as a society than we who
hail from the Land of the Free.</font></font>

<br><b><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>From Mary Beth
Maslowski in Munich:</font></font></b>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+2>I</font><font size=+1>n
Germany on Tuesday morning the news of Clinton's "inappropriate relationship"
with Monica Lewinsky took second place on radio and TV to the announcement
that the Ministry of Labor has had more success in arranging work for the
unemployed this year than at the same time last year.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Perhaps if German
elections weren't looming in September, this politically motivated labor
message wouldn't have usurped the news of the American president's illicit
liaison. For print media, the story broke too late to even reach the morning
papers; however, afternoon editions placed the story prominently on the
first page, and news Web sites and videotext (a non-graphics television
news service) were quick to print the entire text of Clinton's speech.
By the time the 8 o'clock news rolled around, the admission and its ramifications
got more air time and German journalists and political experts were quick
to comment on what they deemed as obvious efforts by Clinton to soften
and double-talk his way out of seven months of lying.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Oddly enough, Monica
Lewinsky is suddenly conspicuously absent from the musings of political
pundits. Now the first lady is the woman to watch and wonder about. On
a Bavarian radio station this morning, a prominent psychologist has predicted
that Hillary Clinton will survive the <i>"Sturm"</i> and continue to stand
by her man.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Whether the focus
is on Clinton, his wife or Lewinsky, this omnipresent media coverage seems
slightly out of place in Germany. In the months leading up to Monday's
mea culpa, all print media from Der Spiegel (a slightly left Newsweek equivalent)
to the yellow-press Bild have been featuring almost daily pictures and
speculative stories. This seems odd, since most Germans will readily admit
that a person's private life, homegrown or not, is his or her own business.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>And while almost everyone
knows that several prominent German politicians have had dalliances of
their own, the media doesn't usually touch the stuff, and they've had the
chance. A few years ago, when SPD member Gerhard Schroeder (Kohl's biggest
threat in the upcoming elections) divorced his wife for a younger one,
the spurned woman took her tale to TV and the newspapers. However, no one
seemed interested and she soon faded into the background once again.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>To get an idea of
what the average Johann or Jana on the street thinks about the Clinton
affair, you have to ask them yourself. Broadcast media here like to play
sound bites of what Americans are saying about the latest twist in this
ongoing scandal -- since most Germans say, "This affair doesn't affect
me" or "It's not my business."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>"I'm more interested
in the U.S. reaction," a Munich native said when I did my rounds this afternoon.
Yet there must be some curiosity since ARD, the top television station
in Germany, has even rescheduled its prime-time lineup to broadcast a half-hour
special on the story. Hmm, could someone be lying here?</font></font>
