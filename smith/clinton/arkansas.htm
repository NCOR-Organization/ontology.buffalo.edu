THE PROGRESSIVE REVIEW</a></font></b></center>

<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1950s</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>When Bill Clinton is 7, his family moves from Hope, Arkansas,
to the long-time mob resort of Hot Springs, AR. Here Al Capone is said
to have had permanent rights to suite 443 of the Arlington Hotel. Clinton's
stepfather is a gun-brandishing, alcoholic who loses his Buick franchise
through mismanagement and his own pilfering. He physically abuses his family,
including the young Bill. His mother is a heavy gambler with mob ties.
According to FBI and local police officials, his Uncle Raymond -- to whom
young Bill turns for wisdom and support -- is a colorful car dealer, slot
machine owner and gambling operator, who thrives on the fault line of criminality
(except when his house is firebombed). Uncle Raymond's gambling operations
are franchised by the Marcello organization of New Orleans.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1960s</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>A federal investigation concludes that Hot Springs has
the largest illegal gambling operations in the United States.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton goes to Georgetown University where he finds a
mentor in Professor Carroll Quigley. Quigley writes: "That the two political
parties should represent opposed ideals and policies. . . is a foolish
idea. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical . . .The policies
that are vital and necessary for America are no longer subjects of significant
disagreement, but are disputable only in detail, procedure, priority, or
method. "</font>
<p><font size=+0>Bill Clinton, according to several agency sources interviewed
by biographer Roger Morris, works as a CIA informer while briefly and erratically
a Rhodes Scholar in England. Although without visible means of support,
he travels around Europe and the Soviet Union, staying at the ritziest
hotel in Moscow. During this period the US government is using well educated
assets such as Clinton as part of Operation Chaos, a major attempt to break
student resistance to the war and the draft.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Bill Clinton and his friend Jim McDougal get a job in
the office of Senator J. William Fulbright. The Washington Post will later
write, "McDougal was interested in making money while Clinton was obsessed
with political stature."</font>
<p><font size=+0>After becoming involved in politics, Wellesley graduate
Hillary Rodham orders her senior thesis sealed from public view.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1974</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Uncle Raymond gets Bill Clinton a $10,000 loan and provides
some free houses from which he can run his campaign for Congress. Raymond's
drinking buddy, druggist and backroom gambling operator, Gabe Crawford,
offers his private plane. Clinton loses.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1976</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Bill Clinton is elected attorney general of Arkansas.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1977</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Two Indonesian billionaires come to Arkansas. Mochtar
Riady and Liem Sioe Liong are close to Suharto. Riady is looking for an
American bank to buy.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Riady's agent is Jackson Stephens, who also brokers the
arrival of BCCI to this country and steers BCCI's founder, Hassan Abedi,
to Bert Lance.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Apparently because of pressure from Indonesia, Riady withdraws
his bid to buy Lance's 30% share of the National Bank of Georgia. Instead,
a BCCI front man buys the shares and Abedi moves to secretly take over
First American Bankshares -- later the subject of the only BCCI-connected
scandal to be prosecuted in the US.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Riady's teen-age son is taken on as an intern by Stephens
Inc. He later says he was "sponsored" by Bill Clinton.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1978</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton is elected governor.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Clintons and McDougals buy land in the Ozarks for
$203,000 with mostly borrowed funds. The Clintons get 50% interest with
no cash down. The plot, known as Whitewater, is fifty miles from the nearest
grocery store. The Washington Post will report later that some purchasers
of lots, many of them retirees, "put up houses or cabins, others slept
in vans or tents, hoping to be able to live off the land." More than half
of the purchasers will lose their plots thanks to the sleazy form of financing
used.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Two months after commencing the Whitewater scam, Hillary
Clinton invests $1,000 in cattle futures. Within a few days she has a $5,000
profit. Before bailing out she earns nearly $100,000 on her investment.
Many years later, several economists will calculate that the chances of
earning such returns legally were one in 250 million.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Governor Clinton appoints Jim McDougal an economic development
advisor.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Roger Clinton develops a four-gram a day cocaine habit,
getting his stuff from New York and Medellin suppliers, based (as one middleman
will later testify) on "who is brother was."</font>
<p><font size=+0>More than a few Little Rock insiders believe Hillary Clinton
is having an affair with Vince Foster.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1980s</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>According to later sworn testimony by Arkansas trooper
Larry Patterson, Governor Clinton has oral sex with a woman in a car parked
outside Chelsea Clinton's elementary school.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Governor Clinton appoints Web Hubbell to head a new state
ethics commission. First task: to weaken ethics legislation currently under
consideration by exempting the governor from some of its most rigorous
provisions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Arkansas becomes a major center of gun-running, drugs
and money laundering. The IRS warns other law enforcement agencies of the
state's "enticing climate." According to Clinton biographer Roger Morris,
operatives go into banks with duffel bags full of cash, which bank officers
then distribute to tellers in sums under $10,000 so they don't have to
report the transaction.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sharlene Wilson, according to investigative reporter Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard, flies cocaine from Mena to a pickup point in Texas. Other
drugs, she and others say, are stuffed into chickens for shipping around
the country. Wilson also serves as "the lady with the snow" at "toga parties"
attended, she reports, by Bill Clinton.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton makes a $44,000 profit on a $2,000 investment
in a cellular phone franchise deal that involves taking advantage of the
FCC's preference for locals, minorities and women. The franchise is almost
immediately flipped to the cellular giant, McCaw.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A drug pilot brings a Cessna 210 full of cocaine into
eastern Arkansas where he is met by his pick-up: a state trooper in a marked
police car. "Arkansas," the pilot will recall years later, "was a very
good place to load and unload."</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to his wife, security operative Jerry Parks
delivers large sums of money from Mena airport to Vince Foster at a K-Mart
parking lot. Mrs. Parks discovers this when she opens her car trunk one
day and finds so much cash that she has to sit on the trunk to close it
again. She asks her husband whether he is dealing drugs, and he allegedly
explains that Foster paid him $1,000 for each trip he took to Mena. Parks
said he didn't "know what they were doing, and he didn't care to know.
He told me to forget what I'd seen.". . . .Later Evans-Pritchard will write,
"Foster was using him as a kind of operative to collect sensitive information
on things and do sensitive jobs. Some of this appears to have been done
on behalf of Hillary Clinton. . . Foster told him that Hillary wanted it
done. Now, my understanding . . . is that she wanted to know how vulnerable
he would be in a presidential race on the question of -- how shall I put
it? -- his appetites."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton quietly lobbies on behalf of the Contras
and against groups and individuals opposing them.</font></blockquote>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="100%"><font size=-1>&nbsp;<b>The sudden violent deaths of persons
connected in some way to the Clinton machine now number over 30. Since
most of these deaths -- like much else in this article --</b></font><b>
<font size=-1>have been at best shoddily investigated by public officials,
it is impossible to determine which are the result of foul play and which
are coincidental. Barbara Wise is a case in point. This woman, whose partially
nude body was found in the Commerce Department, has been described by some
as being a highly disturbed person whose death may be totally unrelated
to the Clinton scandals. Similarly, a shadowy business figure, perhaps
with intelligence ties, cancelled at the last minute his seat on the ill-fated
Ron Brown plane. This same businessman died later in the crash of TWA 800.
Coincidence or hidden meaning? We simply don't know.</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>Even in cases of foul play, readers are warned not
to leap to conclusions as to motivation or potential perpetrators. For
example, if Vincent Foster was killed rather than committing suicide, it
may not have been because of the shady dealings at the White House but
because public investigations of these shady dealings threatened to expose
peripheral criminality such as past money launderirng, drug trafficking,
or illegal intelligence activities.</font></b></td>

<blockquote><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1980</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>The husband of a Little Rock attorney warns Clinton at
the Democratic Convention that if he approaches his wife again, he'll kill
him. Clinton apologizes and agrees to leave the woman alone.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Bill Clinton loses re-election as governor. He will win
two years later.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1981</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton writes Jim McDougal: "If Reagonomics works
at all, Whitewater could become the Western Hemisphere's Mecca."</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1982</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Major drug trafficker Barry Seal, under pressure from
the Louisiana cops, relocates his operations to Mena, Arkansas.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A DEA report uncovered by Evans-Pritchard will cite an
informant claiming that a key Arkansas figure and backer of Clinton "smuggles
cocaine from Colombia, South America, inside race horses to Hot Springs."</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1983</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Mochtar Riady forms Lippo Finance &amp; Investment in
Little Rock. A non-citizen, Riady hires Carter's former SBA director, Vernon
Weaver, to chair the firm. The launch is accomplished with the aid of a
$2 million loan guaranteed by the SBA. Weaver uses Governor Clinton as
a character reference to help get the loan guarantee. First loan goes to
Little Rock Chinese restaurant owner Charlie Trie.</font>
<p><font size=+0>State regulators warn McDougal's Madison Guarantee S&amp;L
to stop making imprudent loans. Gov. Clinton is also warned of the problem
but takes no action.</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to a later account in the Tampa Tribune, planes
flying drugs into Mena in coolers marked "medical supplies." are met by
several people close to then-Governor Bill Clinton.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1984</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Riady buys a stake in the Worthen holding company whose
assets include the Stephens-controlled Worthen Bank. Price: $16 million.
Other Worthen co-owners will eventually include BCCI investor Abdullah
Taha Bakhish.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Jim McDougal tries to prevent state agencies from shutting
down his S&amp;L, which has been providing cash for the Whitewater operation.
Mrs. Clinton is put on a $2,000 a month retainer by the S&amp;L. Ms. Clinton
will later claim not to have received any retainer nor to have been deeply
involved with Madison. Subsequent records show, however, that she represented
Madison before the state securities department. After the revelation, she
says, "For goodness sakes, you can't be a lawyer if you don't represent
banks."</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Washington Times will later quote an unnamed Clinton
business associate who claims the governor used to "jog over to McDougal's
office about once a month to pick up the [retainer] check for his wife."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Foreshadowing future Wall Street interest in Clinton,
Goldman Sachs, Payne Webber, Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch all show
up as financial backer of the governor. Also on the list: future king-maker
Pam Harriman. But Bill Clinton's funders include not only some of the biggest
corporate names ever to show an interest in the tiny state of Arkansas
but some of the most questionable. A former US Attorney will later tell
Roger Morris, "That was the election when the mob really came into Arkansas
politics. . . It wasn't just Bill Clinton and it went beyond our old Dixie
Mafia. . . This was eastern and west coast crime money that noticed the
possibilities just like the legitimate corporations did."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Dan Lasater buys a ski resort in New Mexico for $20 million
and uses Clinton's name (with permission) to promote it. Later, a US Customs
investigative report will note that the resort is being used for drug operations
and money laundering. Lasater also flies to Belize with his aide Patsy
Thomasson to buy a 24,000 acre ranch. Among those present at the negotiations
is the US Ambassador. The deal falls through because of the opposition
of the Belize government.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A private contractor for Arkansas' prison system stops
selling prisoners' blood to a Canadian broker and elsewhere overseas after
admitting the blood might be contaminated with the AIDS virus or hepatitis.
Sales of prisoners' blood in US are already forbidden.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Tens of thousands of dollars in mysterious checks begin
moving through Whitewater's account at Madison Guaranty. Investigators
will later suspect that McDougal was operating a check-kiting scheme to
drain money from the S&amp;L</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hot Springs police record Roger Clinton during a cocaine
transaction. Roger says, "Got to get some for my brother. He's got a nose
like a vacuum cleaner."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Ronald Reagan wants to send the National Guard to Honduras
to help in the war against the Contras. Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis goes to the Supreme Court in a futile effort to stop it but Clinton
is happy to oblige, even sending his own security chief, Buddy Young, along
to keep an eye on things. Winding up its tour, the Arkansas Guard declares
large quantities of its weapons "excess" and leaves them behind for the
Contras.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1985</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>A relative of Bill Clinton is raped. Wayne Dumond is arrested
and imprisoned in the case. While awaiting sentencing, Dumond himself is
sexually assaulted and castrated by two masked men. A local sheriff, later
sentenced to 160 years for extortion and drug dealing, displays Dumond's
testicles in a jar on his desk under a sign that read, "That's what happens
to people who fool around in my county." A parole board, upon receiving
new evidence of Dumond's innocence, will vote to release him after 4 1/2
years in prison. Governor Clinton -- according to the managing editor of
the Arkansas Democrat Gazette -- stages a "romping, stomping fit" and blocks
the release.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton establishes the Arkansas Development Finance Authority
that will be used, in the words of one well-connected Arkansan as "his
own political piggy bank." Though millions of dollars are funneled to Clinton
allies, records of repayments will be hazy or non-existent. AFDA brags
to prospective out-of-state corporations of Arkansas' anti-union climate.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Arkansas state pension funds --deposited in Worthen by
Governor Bill Clinton -- suddenly lose 15% of their value because of the
failure of high risk, short-term investments and the brokerage firm that
bought them. The $52 million loss is covered by a Worthen check written
by Jack Stephens in the middle of the night, an insurance policy, and the
subsequent purchase over the next few months of 40% of the bank by Mochtar
Riady. Clinton and Worthen escape a major scandal.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Mochtar's son James comes back to Arkansas to manage Worthen
as president. He bonds with Clinton and Charlie Trie.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Lippo executive and Chinese native John Huang becomes
active in Lippo's operations in Arkansas.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Mochtar and James Riady engineer the takeover of the First
National Bank of Mena in a town of 5,000 with few major assets beyond a
Contra supply base, drug running and money-laundering operations.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Terry Reed is asked to take part in Operation Donation,
under which planes and boats needed by the Contras "disappear," allowing
owners to claim insurance. Reed has been a Contra operative and CIA asset
working with Felix Rodriguez, the Contra link to the CIA and then-Vice
President Bush's office. Reed later claims he refused, but that his plane
was removed while he was away.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Park on Meter, a parking meter manufacturer in Russellville,
Arkansas, receives the first industrial development loan from the Arkansas
Development Finance Authority in 1985. Some suspect that POM is doing a
lot more than making parking meters -- specifically that it has secret
federal contracts to make components of chemical and biological weapons
and devices to carry them on C-130s for the Contras. The company later
denies the Contra connection although it will admit having secret military
contracts. Web Hubbell is the company's lawyer. Right next to POM, on land
previously owned by it, is an Army reserve chemical warfare company.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A series of checks to Clinton and his campaign are endorsed
and deposited in Madison S&amp;L. One of the checks -- a cashiers check
in the amount of $3,000 -- has the name of a 24-year-old college student
on it. When informed of this in 1993, the then-student, Ken Peacock, will
deny having made any such donation.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Whitewater fails to file corporate tax returns for this
year.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1986</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Journalist Evans-Pritchard will describe the Arkansas
of this period as a "major point for the transshipment of drugs" and "perilously
close to becoming a 'narco-republic' -- a sort of mini-Columbia within
the borders of the United States." There is "an epidemic of cocaine, contaminating
the political establishment from top to bottom," with parties "at which
cocaine would be served like hors d'oeuvres and sex was rampant." Clinton
attends some of these events.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A Federal Home Loan Bank Board audit describes Madison
as financially reckless, rife with conflicts and on the brink of collapse.
It says that the S&amp;L's records are so poor that examiners often could
not discover the "real nature" of transactions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Capital Management Services Inc., owned by David Hale,
makes an SBA-approved loan of $300,000 to Susan McDougal, sole owner of
an advertising firm called Master Marketing. The loan will never be repaid.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The attorney general of Louisiana tells US Attorney General
Ed Meese that drug trafficker Barry Seal has smuggled drugs into the US
worth $3-$5 billion.</font>
<p><font size=+0>CIA operative Eugene Hasenfus is shot down over Nicaragua
in a plane based in Mena, Arkansas.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Whitewater fails to file corporate tax returns for this
year.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1987</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>According to the McDougals, the Whitewater files are transferred
to the Clintons. In the 1992 campaign, the Clintons will say they can not
find the records.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton gives Arkansas Traveler awards to Contra operatives
Adolpho and Mario Calero and John Singlaub.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Two boys are killed in Saline County and left on a railroad
track to be run over by a train The initial finding of joint suicide will
be punctured by dogged investigators whose efforts are repeatedly blocked
by law enforcement officials. Although no one will ever be charged, the
trail will lead into the penumbra of the Dixie Mafia and the Arkansas political
machine. Some believe the boys died because they accidentally intercepted
a drug drop, but other information suggests the drop may have dispensed
not drugs but cash, gold and platinum -- part of a series of sorties through
which those working with US intelligence were being reimbursed. According
to one version, the boys were blamed in order to cover up the theft of
the drop by persons within the Dixie Mafia and Arkansas political machine.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Terry Reed's plans is returned but, according to his account,
he is asked not report it because it might have to be "borrowed" again.
Reed later says that he had become aware that the Contra operation also
involved drug running and had gotten cold feet. He also believed that large
sums of drug money were being laundered by leading Arkansas financiers.
He went to Felix Rodriguez and told him he was quitting. Reed was subsequently
charged with mail fraud for having allegedly claimed insurance on a plane
that was in fact hidden in a hanger in Little Rock. The head of Clinton's
Swiss Guard, Capt. Buddy Young, will claim to have been walking around
the North Little Rock Airport when "by an act of God" a gust of wind blew
open the hangar door and revealed the Piper Turbo Arrow.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Whitewater fails to file corporate tax returns for this
year.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1988</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Conservative Democrats begin a series of nearly 100 meetings
held at the home of Pam Harriman to plot strategy for the takeover of the
Democratic Party. Donors cough up $1,000 to attend and Harriman eventually
raises $12 million for her kind of Democrat. The right-wing Dems will eventually
settle on Bill Clinton as their presidential choice.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1989</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Madison S&amp;L is closed by federal regulators at an
eventual cost to taxpayers of $47 million.</font>
<p><font size=+0>FDIC hires Webster Hubbell of the Rose firm to press its
case concerning Madison. Rose law firm, now representing FDIC, sues an
accounting firm for $60 million, blaming its audits for causing millions
of dollars in losses to the S&amp;L. Although the job earns Rose $400,000
in fees and expenses the accounting firm will eventually settle by paying
the government just $1 million.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A US Senate subcommittee calls the available evidence
about Mena sufficient for an indictment on money laundering charges." But
the feds scrap a five year probe of Mena and interfere in local investigations,
and the state police are taken off the case. Clinton refuses a request
from one of his own prosecutors to pursue the matter.</font>
<p><font size=+0>What will later be known as the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy
begins on the left as a group of progressive students at the University
of Arkansas form the Arkansas Committee to look into Mena, drugs, money
laundering, and Arkansas politics.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1990</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>James Riady takes over operations of a new branch of the
Lippo Bank, working with Hong Kong Lippo executive, John Huang.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sharlene Wilson tells a US grand jury investigating drugs
in Arkansas that she provided cocaine to Clinton during his first term
and that once the governor was so high he fell into a garbage can. The
federal drug investigation is shut down within days
of her testimony. Wilson
flees, terrified of the state prosecuting attorney -- her former lover,
and Clinton ally, Dan Harmon. She will be eventually arrested by Harmon
himself and sent up for 31 years on a minor drug charge. She is still in
jail.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The case against Terry Reed is thrown out of court by
the federal judge who said, "It's my opinion no jury could find by reasonable
doubt that the defendant was guilty. There are too many holes in the chain
of proof for the government to prove mail fraud." Clinton's security chief,
Captain Buddy Young, is described by the judge as having a "reckless disregard
for the truth." Young, who will play a major role in keeping state troopers
quiet about Clinton, will end up in a $92,000-a-year job with FEMA, a federal
agency established to handle major disasters.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Drug distributor Dan Lasater is pardoned by Governor Clinton
after serving just six months in jail and four in a halfway house on minor
charges. One law enforcement official will describe the investigation into
Lasater's operations as "either a high dive or extremely unprofessional.
Take your pick." The alleged reason for the pardon: so Lasater can get
a hunting license. Lasater returns to his 7,400 ranch in Saline County.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1991</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>The Arkansas Industrial Development Commission furthers
the Indonesian - Arkansas connection. Deals are worked on for Wal-Mart,
Tyson's Foods, and JB Hunt. Later documents uncovered by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
will "make reference to Clinton's ideal position as president . . . in
helping to secure Arkansas-Indonesian deals." The US ambassador in Jakarta
at the time will later remark, "There were lots of people from Arkansas
who came through Indonesia."</font>
<p><font size=+0>An IRS memorandum reveals that even at this late date
"the CIA still has ongoing operations out of the Mena, AR airport. "</font>
<p><font size=+0>Arkansas State Police investigator Russell Welsh, who
has been working with IRS investigator Bill Duncan on drug running and
money laundering at Mena, develops pneumonia-like symptoms. Welch, central
to the Mena investigation, is discovered to have been poisoned by anthrax.</font>
<p><font size=+0>State Attorney General Winston Bryant and Arkansas Rep.
Bill Alexander send two boxes of Mena files to special prosecutor Lawrence
Walsh. Says Alexander later, "The feds dropped the ball and covered it
up. I have never seen a whitewash job like this case."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Jackson Stephens and BCCI figure Ghaith Pharaon buy BCCI's
former Hong Kong subsidiary.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1992</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>The Worthen Bank gives Clinton a $3.5 million line of
credit allowing the cash-strapped candidate to finish the primaries.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Little Rock Worldwide Travel provides Clinton with $1
million in deferred billing for his campaign trips. Clinton aide David
Watkins boasts to a travel magazine, "Were it not for World Wide Travel
here, the Arkansas governor may never have been in contention for the highest
office in the land." In fact, without the Worthen and Worldwide largess,
it is unlikely that the cash-strapped candidate could have survived through
the later primaries.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A massive "bimbo" patrol is established to threaten, buy,
or otherwise disarm scores of women who have had sexual encounters with
Clinton. The campaign uses private investigators in an extensive operation
that will be joked about at the time but later will be seen as a form of
blackmail as well as psychological and physical intimidation.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton leaves the campaign trail to attend the execution
of cop-killer Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally incompetent black man given
to howling who is so dysfunctional that he asks his guards at his last
meal to save his pie for later.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Money magazine reports that Clinton annually receives
about $1.4 million in admissions tickets to the state-regulated Oaklawn
racetrack which he hands out to campaign contributors and others.</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to Brooks Jackson of CNN, the commission that
regulates Arkansas's only greyhound track meets several times a year at
the track's exclusive Kennel Club, with the Southland Greyhound Park paying
for the commissioners' food and booze.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Gennifer Flowers records her last conversation with Bill
Clinton. On the tape Clinton says, "If they ever ask if you've talked to
me about it, you can say no." Clinton describes Mario Cuomo as a "mean
son of a bitch" and when Flowers says, "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't
have some Mafioso connections," the reply is: "Well, he acts like one,"
followed by a chuckle. Of the press, Clinton advises, "If they ever hit
you with it, just say no and go on. There's nothing they can do. I expected
them to look into it and come interview you. But if everybody is on record
denying it, no problem" Many papers, including the Washington Post and
the New York Times, fail to let their readers know what is on the tapes.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A survey of campaign reporters finds that by February,
90% favor Clinton for president.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Major media censor a second alleged sex scandal involving
Bill Clinton that breaks in a supermarket tabloid just days before the
New Hampshire primary. The story, in the Globe, charges that Clinton had
a relationship with a woman who claimed that Clinton was the father of
her child. The woman also claims she attended group sex sessions with Clinton.
The woman is now reportedly in Australia.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Time Magazine runs an article called "Anatomy of a Smear"
in which Clinton's involvement in the Mena drug/Contra operation is whitewashed
and those trying to expose it are, well, smeared.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Pine Bluff Commercial notes: "It's very difficult
to catch Bill Clinton in a flat lie. His specialty is a lengthy disingenuousness."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Former Miss Arkansas Sally Perdue goes on the Sally Jesse
Raphael Show and says she had an affair with Bill Clinton. She will later
tell the London Sunday Telegraph that state troopers often dropped Clinton
off at her place in his jogging gear: "He saw my Steinway grand piano and
went straight over to it and asked me to play. . . When I see him now,
president of the United States, meeting world leaders, I can't believe
it. . . I still have this picture of him wearing my black nightgown, playing
the sax badly. . . this guy tiptoeing across the park and getting caught
on the fence. How do you expect me to take him seriously?"</font>
<p><font size=+0>After the TV show, Perdue says she was visited by a man
who described himself as a Democratic Party operative and who warned her
not to reveal specifics of the affair. "He said there were people in high
places who were anxious about me and they wanted me to know that keeping
my mouth shut would be worthwhile. . . If I was a good little girl, and
didn't kill the messenger; I'd be set for life: a federal job, nothing
fancy but a regular paycheck. . . I'd never have to worry again. But if
I didn't take the offer, then they knew that I went jogging by myself and
he couldn't guarantee what would happen to my 'pretty little legs.'"</font>
<p><font size=+0>Perdue says she later found a shotgun cartridge on the
driver's seat of her Jeep and had her back window shattered.</font>
<p><font size=+0>James Riady, his family, and employees give $700,000 to
Clinton and the Democratic campaign.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1993</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>John Huang and James Riady give $100,000 to Clinton's
inaugural fund.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker comes to Washington to
see his old boss sworn in, leaving his state under the control of the president
pro tem of the senate, Little Rock dentist Jerry Jewell. Jewell uses his
power as acting governor to issue a number of pardons, one of them for
a convicted drug dealer, Tommy McIntosh. According to the Washington Times,
many in the state "say it was a political payoff, offered in exchange for
dirty tricks Mr. McIntosh played on Clinton political opponents during
the presidential campaign, or as a payoff for stopping his attacks on Mr.
Clinton." It seems that the elder McIntosh had worked for Clinton in his
last state campaign and, according to McIntosh in a 1991 lawsuit, had agreed
not only to pay him $25,000 but to help him market his recipe for sweet
potato pie and to pardon his son.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Webster Hubbell's name surfaces as a potential nominee
for deputy attorney general but he tells friends he does not want that
job or, reports Time, "to take any other position that involves Senate
confirmation -- perhaps to avoid fishing expeditions into the law firm's
confidential business."</font>
<p><font size=+0>John Huang arranges a private meeting between Mochtar
Riady and Clinton at which Riady presses for renewal of China's 'most favored
nation' status and a relaxation of economic sanctions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>China's 'most favored nation' status is renewed.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Two Arkansas state troopers describe arguments between
the Clintons, including (in the words of Washington Times reporter Jerry
Seper) "foul-mouthed shouting matches and furniture-breaking sessions."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton and David Watkins move to oust the White
House travel office in favor of World Wide Travel, Clinton's source of
$1 million in fly-now-pay-later campaign trips. The White House fires seven
long-term employees for alleged mismanagement and kickbacks. The director,
Billy Dale, charged with embezzlement, will be acquitted in less than two
hours by the jury.</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to a later report in Insight Magazine, the Clinton
administration eavesdrops on over 300 locations during the Seattle Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Conference. FBI videotapes of diplomatic suites "show
underage boys engaging in sexcapades with men in several rooms over a period
of days." The operation involves the FBI, CIA, NSA and Office of Naval
Intelligence. Bugged are hotel rooms, telephones, conference centers, cars,
and even a charter boat. Some of the information obtained is apparently
passed on to individuals with financial interests in Asia.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Washington attorney Paul Wilcher is found dead on a toilet
in his apartment. He is said to be investigating various scandals including
the October Surprise, the 1980 election campaign, drug and gun-running
through Mena and the Waco assault. He was also planning a TV documentary
on his findings. He delivered an extensive affidavit to Janet Reno three
weeks before his death.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Vince Foster, the Clintons' attorney, finally files missing
Whitewater tax returns.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The RTC and SBA investigate the $300,000 SBA-approved
loan to Susan McDougal in 1986, provided by Capital-Management Services
Inc. owned by David L. Hale.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton asks White House physician, Dr. Burton Lee, to
give him an allergy shot. Lee refuses to do so without knowing the president's
medical history or what is in the serum that has been delivered without
supporting data from Arkansas. Within hours of his refusal, Lee is fired
and told to pack and leave immediately.</font>
<p><font size=+0>On July 19, FBI director William Sessions is fired. Clinton
personally orders him by phone to turn in his FBI property and leave headquarters.</font>
<p><font size=+0>That evening, Jerry Parks' wife Jane overhears a heated
telephone conversation with Vince Foster in which her husband says, "You
can't give Hillary those files, they've got my name all over them."</font>
<p><font size=+0>On July 20, Clinton names Louis Freeh as Sessions' successor.</font>
<p><font size=+0>That same day, the FBI raids David Hale's Little Rock
office and seizes documents including those relating to Capital-Management.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Just hours after the search warrant authorizing the raid
is signed by a federal magistrate in Little Rock, Vince Foster apparently
drives to Ft. Marcy Park without any car keys in a vehicle that changes
color over the next few hours, walks across 700 feet of park without accruing
any dirt or grass stains, and then shoots himself with a vanishing bullet
that leaves only a small amount of blood. Or at least that is what would
have to have occurred if official accounts are to be reconciled with the
available evidence. There are numerous other anomalies in this quickly-declared
suicide. Despite two badly misleading independent counsel reports, Foster's
death will remain an unsolved mystery.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Less than three hours after Foster's body is found, his
office is secretly searched by Clinton operatives, including Mrs. Clinton's
chief of staff. Another search occurs two days later. Meanwhile, US Park
Police and FBI agents are not allowed to search the office on grounds of
"executive privilege."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Foster's suicide note is withheld from investigators for
some 30 hours. The note is in 27 pieces with one other piece missing.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Patrick Knowlton, who stops in the park seventy minutes
before Foster's body is found, reports seeing things that do not fit the
official version. Declining under pressure to change his story, he is eventually
subpoenaed by the Whitewater prosecutor. On that day, he becomes the target
of extensive overt harassment and surveillance of a sort used by intelligence
agencies to intimidate witnesses.</font>
<p><font size=+0>When ex-Clinton security operative Jerry Parks hears of
Vince Foster's body being found at Ft Marcy Park, he tells his wife, "I'm
a dead man." Two months later, Parks will be shot to death in a mob-type
slaying in Little Rock. News of Parks' death sets off a flurry of activity
and closed-door meetings at the White House. Parks' house is ransacked,
and his files, 130 telephone tapes and computer data are removed.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1994</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>John Huang quits the Lippo Group -- with a golden parachute
of around $800,000 -- and goes to work for the Commerce Department. Some
believe the move is instigated by Hillary Clinton. Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown orders a top secret clearance for Huang. While at Commerce, Huang
visits the White House about 70 times, is briefed 37 times by the CIA,
views about 500 intelligence reports, and makes 281 calls to Lippo banks.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Ron Brown goes to China with an unprecedented $5.5 billion
in deals ready to be signed. Included is a $1 billion contact for the Clinton-friendly
Arkansas firm, Entergy Corporation, to manage and expand Lippo's power
plant in northern China. Entergy will also get contracts to build power
plants in Indonesia. James Riady tells the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette: "I
think the idea of having President Clinton from Arkansas in the White House
shouldn't be underestimated."</font>
<p><font size=+0>A memo later found in Commerce Department files describes
Brown's stance with the Chinese on civil liberties: "[Brown] deftly navigated
the human-rights issue by obtaining an agreement on further talks and then
moved directly into the economic issues at hand: helping Chrysler, Sprint
and others with their joint ventures."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Gandy Baugh, an attorney who had represented Clinton buddy
and drug distributor Dan Lasater, allegedly jumps to his death. Baugh's
law partner commits suicide one month later.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Five days after her ex-husband, Danny Ferguson, is named
a co-defendant in the Paula Jones law suit, Kathy Ferguson is found dead.
She leaves a suicide note but the body is found in her living room next
to packed bags as though she was planning to take a trip. Not long afterwards,
Kathy Ferguson's fianc&eacute;e, a state trooper, is found dead by gunshot
at her gravesite. Leaves note saying "I can't stand it any more." The local
police chief says, "It puts big questions in your mind. Why?" Both victims
are shot in the back of the head, unusual in the case of suicide.</font>
<p><font size=+0>White House-assigned FBI agent Gary Aldrich agrees to
help trim the Christmas tree in the Blue Room. Aldrich is surprised to
find a small clay ornament of 12-lords-aleaping. Among the things that
were aleaping on the 12 lords are their erections. Also provided by Hillary
Clinton and her staff for the tree: ornaments made of drug paraphernalia
such as syringes and roach clips, three French hens in a menage &aacute;
trois, two turtle doves fornicating, five golden rings attached to a gingerbread
man's ear, nipple, belly button, nose, and penis.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hundreds of White House employees still do not have security
clearances.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Independent prosecutor Dan Smaltz and FBI agents grill
a former Tyson food pilot for three days. The pilot claims to have carried
cash in envelopes from Tyson Food to the Arkansas governor's mansion. Says
Smaltz later to Time magazine, "'I nearly fell off my chair when I heard
Joe make the allegation. I took over the questions." Janet Reno, however,
blocks Smaltz from pursuing the issue.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Bill Clinton speaks to a group of Southeast Washington
high school students about sex: "This is not a sport, this is a solemn
responsibility." He tells the young men at the gathering that they should
stop having sex "when they're not prepared to marry the others, they're
not prepared to take responsibility for the children and they're not even
able to take responsibility for themselves."</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to US Customs records, Macao businessman Ng
Lap Seng, arrives in America with $175,000 in cash. Two days later he meets
with Charlie Trie and Mark Middleton at the White House. That evening Ng
sits at Clinton's table at a DNC fundraiser.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1995</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>John Huang requests several top secret files on China
just before a meeting with the Chinese ambassador.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Webster Hubbell, although not known for skill in Asian
trade matters, goes to work for a Lippo Group affiliate after being forced
out of the Clinton administration prior to going to jail.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In late March, a score of witnesses are subpoenaed for
a grand jury probe of Ron Brown, who hires a $750/hour criminal attorney.
Among the issues: an Oklahoma gas company's alleged funneling of over a
half million dollars to Brown in order to get him to fix a lawsuit pending
against the firm.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Janet Reno names Daniel Pearson to head the Brown probe.
She says he can investigate anything. Brown reportedly urges Clinton to
get Reno off his back, but evidence of Brown's crookedness has reached
Capitol Hill and the Attorney General apparently feels there is no turning
back. It will be later alleged by some close to Brown that the Commerce
Secretary has told the president that if he is going down, he is not going
down alone.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Four days after the grand jury subpoenas are issued, Ron
Brown is dead -- killed when the plane in which he was flying (along with
nearly three dozen other Americans) crashes into a mountain in Croatia.
From the start, there are a number of anomalies including inconsistencies
over the state of the weather, where the plane is reported to have crashed,
what happened to the plane's black boxes, and the subsequent suicide of
an airport official in charge of navigational aids. Further, even though
the crash site is a little over a mile from the runway, the first rescuers
do not officially arrive on the scene for more than four hours.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The White House hosts a major drug dealer at its Christmas
party. Jorge Cabrera -- who gave $20,000 to the DNC -- is also photographed
with Al Gore at a Miami fund-raiser, a fact the Clinton administration
initially attempts to conceal by arguing that a publicity shot with the
Veep is covered by the Privacy Act. Cabrera was indicted in 1983 by a federal
grand jury -- on racketing and drug charges -- and again in 1988, when
he was accused of managing a continuing narcotics operation. He pleaded
guilty to lesser charges and served 54 months on prison. After his visit
to the White House he will be sentenced to 19 years on prison for transporting
6,000 pounds of cocaine into the US. The Secret Service says letting him
come to the WH was okay because he posed no threat to the president.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Washington Times reports that Clinton has pardoned
without fanfare a gambling pal of his mother. Jack Pakis was convicted
under the Organized Crime Control Act, sentenced to two years in prison,
but the sentence was suspended. He was fined and put on probation. Pakis
had been arrested as part of an FBI sting operation against illegal gambling
in Hot Springs. According to the Washington Times, "his trial judge described
Mr. Pakis as a professional gambler, part owner of an illegal casino and
an illegal bookmaker for football and horse-racing bets." US District Judge
Oren Harris, remarked that the FBI had "reached into Hot Springs to put
a stop to gambling that has existed here since the 1920s." But he suspends
the sentence, saying that since local acceptance of gambling was so widespread
it would be unfair to send Pakis and his co-defendants to jail. Pakis,
incidentally, once owned a piece of the Southern Club -- Al Capone's favorite
-- in Hot Springs where, as Clinton's mom put it in her autobiography,
"gangsters were cool and the rules were meant to be bent."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Roger Morris and Sally Denton write a well-documented
account of drug and Contra operations in Arkansas during the '80s. The
Washington Post's Outlook section wants to run it, offers their highest
price ever for a story, but is overruled by higher-ups. Less than a year
earlier the Post had published a lead Style section piece making fun of
the Mena affair, saying "allegedly dark deeds at Mena have helped foster
the cult of conspiracy that has taken root among some of Clinton's more
virulent opponents." After weeks of stalling by Post brass, Morris and
Denton pull the story which eventually appears in Penthouse.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1996</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton gives a speech to a group of Little Rock supporters
in which he calls those pressing the Whitewater and other investigations
"a cancer" that he will "cut out of American politics."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Barbara Wise, a Commerce Department (International Trade
Administration) secretary and associate of John Huang, is found bruised
and partially nude in a locked office at Commerce. Cause of death remains
unknown.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton's attempts to conceal the fact that she
had $120,000 of editorial help in preparing her book-like substance.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton tells New Zealand television that she
was named after Sir Edmund Hillary. At the time of Mrs. Clinton's birth,
Hillary was an unknown beekeeper.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Senator Bob Kerrey, chair of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, tells Esquire that Clinton is "an unusually good liar."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Convicted cocaine distributor Dan Lasater testifies before
Congress. The New York Times, among others, does not cover the story even
though Lasater is close to Clinton and paid off Roger Clinton's debt to
the drug cartel. Lasater also raised race horses and was a track buddy
of Virginia Kelly, through whom he met her son Bill. When Lasater started
a bonding company, Bill Clinton recommended to him highway commissioner
Patsy Thomasson, who would become vice president of the Lasater firm and
have power of attorney while he was in jail. Thomasson would eventually
become director of White House Management and Administration, responsible
for drug testing among other things. While with Lasater, Thomasson hired
Clinton's half-brother as a limo driver. Roger was also employed as a stable
hand at Lasater's Florida farm. In his trial, and in testimony before the
Senate Whitewater committee, Lasater admits to being free with coke, including
ashtrays full of it on his corporate jet. He also admits to having given
coke to employees and to minors. But he takes umbrage at being called a
drug dealer since he didn't charge for the stuff.</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to some witnesses, Lasater also had a back door
pass to the governor's mansion. One state trooper reported taking Clinton
to Lasater's office regularly and waiting forty-five minutes or an hour
for him to come out.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The death of ex-CIA director William Colby, allegedly
while canoeing, raises a number of questions. For example, Colby left his
home unlocked, his computer on, and a partly eaten dinner on the table.
Colby had recently become an editor of Strategic Investment a newsletter
which was doing investigative reporting on the Vince Foster death.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Jim McDougal tells a reporter that he doesn't expect to
leave prison alive.</font>
<p><font size=+0>An independent investigator finds evidence of an electronic
transfer of $50 million from the Arkansas Development Financial Authority
to a bank in the Cayman Islands. Grand Cayman has a population of 18,000,
570 commercial banks, one bank regulator and a bank secrecy law. It is
a favorite destination spot for laundered drug money..</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+3>1997</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor says he is "stunned"
to learn that some of the companies joining him on trade missions were
DNC campaign contributors. He apparently has missed material sent out by
the DNC, complete with letter from Bill Clinton, that promised donors of
at least $10,000 an invitation to "join Party leadership as they travel
abroad to examine current and developing issues."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Hillary Clinton goes for her daily dose of photographic
self-aggrand-izement at the pediatrics ward of the Georgetown University
Medical Center. She is to be pictured reading to the kids. The problem:
sick children don't look that cute, especially those who are bald from
cancer treatments or fitted out with tubes and such. The solution: replace
the sick children with well versions belonging to the hospital staff. It
works beautifully.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Mary Caitrin Mahoney, a former White House intern, is
shot five times in an execution-style slaying of three Starbucks employees
in Georgetown. The other two victims are shot only once. No money is taken.
No neighbors hear gunshots. An informant assisting police in the case is
murdered when sent into a botched drug sting.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko, a West African multi-millionaire,
tries to get released from jail on bribery and smuggling charges by showing
the judge a dinner invitation he received to dine with the president at
a Washington hotel. The judge does not release Sissoko, however, and sets
bail at $20 million. This is a South Florida record.</font>
<p><font size=+0>LD Brown, a former Arkansas state trooper who worked on
Clinton's security details, claims he was approached on a bus in England
and offered $100,000 and a job to change his Whitewater testimony. A second
offer was allegedly made in Little Rock.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A $27,000 check is found in the trunk of a car in Arkansas,
along with other records of McDougal's Madison Guaranty bank. Shortly after
the discovery, an ill and imprisoned McDougal is thrown into solitary for
failure to urinate for a drug test. McDougal is on 12 medications, four
of which make it urination difficult.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Gennifer Flowers reports that after her revelations she
had received death threats and that her house was ransacked.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Monica Lewinsky tells Linda Tripp over the phone, "See,
my mom's big fear is that he's going to send somebody out to kill me."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Two Armed Forces medical examiners confirm that Ron Brown
had a perfectly circular hole in his head that looked like a gun wound.
Army Lt. Col. David Hause was working two tables away from the one at Dover
Air Force Base where Brown was being examined when a "commotion" erupted
and someone said, "Gee, this looks like a gunshot wound." Hause remembers
saying, "Sure enough, it looks like a gunshot wound to me, too." No autopsy
or investigation followed.</font>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size=+2>1998</font></font>
<p><font size=+0>George Stephanopoulos tells ABC This Week that the White
House has a "different, long-term strategy, which I think would be far
more explosive. White House allies are already starting to whisper about
what I'll call the Ellen Rometsch strategy . . . She was a girlfriend of
John F. Kennedy, who also happened to be an East German spy. And Robert
Kennedy was charged with getting her out of the country and also getting
J. Edgar Hoover to go up to the Congress and say, 'Don't you investigate
this, because if you do, we're going to open up everybody's closets." .
. . . Asks Sam Donaldson, "Are you suggesting for a moment that what they're
beginning to say is that if you investigate this too much, we'll put all
your dirty linen right on the table? Every member of the Senate? Every
member of the press corps?" "Absolutely," says Stephanopoulos. "The president
said he would never resign, and I think some around him are willing to
take everybody down with him."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Jim McDougal, who once said that the Clintons move through
people's lives like a tornado, dies after being placed in solitary confinement
again. An unusual Prozac level is found during autopsy. There are questions
about other drugs given, including Lasix, which is contraindicated for
heart patients.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Not long thereafter, another potential witness in the
Clinton scandals investigation dies suddenly. Johnny Franklin Lawhon Jr,
29, was the owner of the auto transmission shop in Mabelville, Arkansas,
who discovered the cashier's check made out to Bill Clinton in a trunk
of a tornado-damaged car. Lawhon strikes a tree in the early hours of March
30 after, according to one witness, "taking off like a shot" from a filling
station.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Linda Tripp is sequestered in an FBI safe house because
of threats against her life.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Arkansas Highway Police seize $3.1 million in cash from
four suitcases in a tractor-trailer rig's sleeper section. The driver is
charged with money laundering among other things. The seizure is the fourth
largest in American history and nearly fifty times more than all the illegal
money seized by Arkansas highway police in a typical year.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Jorge Cabrera -- the drug dealer who gave enough to the
Democrats to have his picture take with both Hillary Clinton and Al Gore
-- is back in the news as a businessman pleads guilty to laundering $3.5
million for Cabrera between 1986 and 1996</font>
<p><font size=+0>Monica Lewinsky tells Linda Tripp that if she would lie
under oath, "I would write you a check. " Also: "I mean, telling the truth
could get you in trouble. I don't know why you'd want to do that." Also:
"I would not cross these -- these people -- for fear of my life." Several
reports have Lewinsky saying on another occasion that she didn't want to
end up like former White House intern Mary Caitrin Mahoney, killed in the
Starbucks execution-style murders.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The sale of Arkansas prisoners blood during the 1980s
becomes a major scandal in Canada as news of it is published. The story
is widely ignored in the US.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Prior to her testimony in the Clinton investigation, Kathleen
Willey claims that the tires on her car were mysteriously punctured with
dozens of nails and the cat she had for many years suddenly disappeared.
Reports ABC's Jackie Judd, "Then just days before she testified in the
Paula Jones lawsuit in early January, Willey was out jogging near her home
when a stranger approached her. . .The man knew what had happened at her
home and that he asked her if the tires had been fixed and if the cat had
been found." The man then allegedly asked Willey, 'Don't you get the message?'
and jogged off."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Bill Clinton gives a speech on September 9 in which he
says," All of you know that I've been on a rather painful journey these
last few weeks and I've had to ask for things that I was more in the habit
of giving in my life than asking for in terms of understanding and forgiveness,
but it's also given me the chance to try to ask, as all of us do: What
do you really care about? What do you want to think about in your last
hours on this earth? What really matters? . . . So I ask you for your understanding,
for your forgiveness on this journey we're on. I hope this will be a time
of reconciliation and healing, and I hope that millions of families all
over America are in a way growing stronger because of this."</font>
