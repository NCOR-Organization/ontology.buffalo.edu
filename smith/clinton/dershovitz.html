<blockquote><b><font size=+1>Why Impeachment Drives 'Em Crazy</font></b>
<p><b>New York Post</b>
<br><b>December 31</b> <i>David Gelertner</i>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp; IF you think the House of Representatives
did right when it impeached the President, hold the phone for a message
from professor Alan Dershowitz, famed Harvard law professor. You represent
''the forces of evil, evil, genuine evil.'' Got that, or shall I repeat?</font>
<p><font size=+0>When Dershowitz talks about evil, the nation ought to
listen. This is a man (after all) of moral stature, a former member of
O.J. Simpson's defense team. Dershowitz happened to be explaining to Geraldo
Rivera what ''a vote against impeachment'' would mean. Such a vote would
not (contrary to what you might have suspected) be ''a vote for Bill Clinton.''
Instead it would be ''a vote against bigotry. It's a vote against fundamentalism.
It's a vote against anti-environmentalism. It's a vote against the right-to-life
movement.'' And it would also be a vote against ''the forces of evil, evil,
genuine evil.''</font>
<p><font size=+0>These ''forces of evil'' presumably have a grip on the
entire pro-impeachment population. That means me, and many other people
who write for this newspaper, and possibly you. Of course it would be no
fun to be declared ''evil'' even by a law professor from a respectable
second-tier school, but to be declared evil by an expert like Dershowitz
is no laughing matter.</font>
<p><font size=+0>It would be undignified and silly for conservatives to
respond to this sort of attack. But they shouldn't ignore it either. They
should try to understand. All over the country liberals have been saying
strange things. Dershowitz is not to everyone's taste, but he doesn't ordinarily
talk crazy either.</font>
<p><font size=+0>What's happening? Why did the New Republic (the respected
liberal weekly) say that House Republicans were ''determined to disgrace
themselves'' and that Henry Hyde ''appears to have succumbed to megalomania''?
Why did Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) say that the House wasn't actually
impeaching the President, it was ''impeaching 130 years of opportunity
and hope for every American''?</font>
<p><font size=+0>Several reasons. One is a matter of perspective. The other
is basic household psychology: Nothing makes a man angrier than to be wrong
and know it.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Certain crimes are forgivable and certain others are not.
When someone commits a forgivable crime, the community isn't obliged to
forgive him - merely allowed to weigh the circumstances. Some of today's
crazy bitterness among liberals reflects a truth that conservatives don't
like to acknowledge, that the President's crimes in the Monica case are
forgivable crimes.</font>
<p><font size=+0>That doesn't mean they aren't serious, or that perjury
is ever defensible or justifiable. It does mean that in some circumstances,
a reasonable person might forgive an act of sex-perjury like the President's.
(It makes no sense to claim that sex has nothing to do with it. Every perjury
is a crime, but all perjuries are not created equal.) These particular
crimes demand to be taken in context.</font>
<p><font size=+0>For Republicans, context makes forgiveness impossible.
It's exactly because the man is esident that letting him get away with
perjury is such a dangerous idea. Laws that apply to the people apply to
the President. No man is above the law. These inciples are basic to American
democracy; it's even possible they are taught at Harvard, although esumably
not by Professor Dershowitz.</font>
<p><font size=+0>And then there is the President's record of shady behavior,
and the various outrages that have been committed on his watch. And the
President's flip arrogance, interspersed with episodes of phony contrition
in which he freely admits that he has caused himself a lot of pain, but
reassures us that he will be feeling better soon. And meanwhile his aides
explain (in effect) that he didn't commit perjury because he didn't mean
to lie, only wanted to mislead people while simultaneously not telling
the truth. Something like O.J. explaining that he didn't mean to kill those
people, only dismember them. A man's record must be weighed in considering
whether to forgive a crime that everyone knows he committed.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sometimes the lines of duty and of grim pleasure coincide.
House Republicans say they acted on principle, and did. But many of them
had come to believe that this President could get away with anything, that
his behavior was disgusting and disgraceful - and they were delighted to
bring him down.</font>
<p><font size=+0>For most Democrats, on the other hand, not to forgive
the President was out of the question. The President stands (in his way)
for policies that Democrats believe in, and has accomplished things that
are important to them. Most important, he beat off the reformist Republicans
who came to Congress in 1994. Future esidents would save the country a
lot of bother if they would commit unforgivable crimes or none at all.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Opposite viewpoints on a forgivable crime explain a lot,
but not everything. They explain why certain liberals got angry, but not
why they went crazy. Dershowitz knows very well, my guess is, that Henry
Hyde doesn't reesent the ''forces of evil.'' Dershowitz is no fool, but
the President is forcing him to play the fool.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Democrats love to talk about the rule of law, and how
the Constitution applies to everyone, and how justice must be served. They
enjoy lashing out against powerful men who twist the law around their little
fingers, and big-shot executives who outmaneuver justice with the help
of their craven staffers, and male bosses who dominate female subordinates
without even trying and then chuckle about it. Democrats love to explain
how government osecutors must attack injustice no matter what, and how
arrogant white males must be brought to heel, and how the legal system
must do what is right, period, and to hell with public opinion.</font>
<p><font size=+0>And now they are forced to listen as Republicans solemnly
(while attempting to keep straight faces) repeat the whole list right back
at them. The President humiliated his wife and Monica Lewinsky, but that's
nothing compared to the humiliation wrought by the Sadist-in-Chief on the
likes of Alan Dershowitz, Jesse Jackson Jr. and the entire Democratic Party.</font>
<p><font size=+0>No Republican has ever humiliated the Democrats the way
President Clinton has. He has made an entire political movement look ridiculous
- and Democrats know it, even if the public doesn't. They won't admit it,
but it hurts.</font>
