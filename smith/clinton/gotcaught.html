President Clinton ends up having to resign -- which is what I expect --
it will not be because he is an immoral or evil person, but because the
American public is still not prepared, psychologically, to accept that
our president is a mere mortal.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>One probable, and
ironic, legacy of Clinton will be that future presidents will be granted
more latitude in personal sexual behavior, just as politicians can today
get divorced or admit having smoked marijuana. This development will be
welcome -- it's long past time for us to <i>cease</i> projecting our subconscious
needs for a larger-than-life leader onto the fallible human beings our
democratic process propels into the office of president. But for the moment,
the cognitive dissonance between our little-discussed expectations of the
presidency and Clinton's behavior may well lead to an Al Gore presidency
within the next year. If so, the proximate cause will be Democratic leaders
asking the president to step down in the face of larger-than-expected congressional
losses and/or a weakening economy. But the real causes will go far deeper.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Did you ever have
a nightmare where you were humiliated before everyone you knew, a nightmare
in which everyone was either disgusted by or laughing at you? And do you
remember how horrible you felt when you awakened? Now imagine poor Bill
Clinton. He is in the middle of a living nightmare of humiliation beyond
anything most of us can imagine. He is embarrassed not just before his
family, friends, co-workers and everyone he knows, but the entire world
-- and the entire world for all time to come, to boot. And, unlike the
rest of us, he can't wake up. He will inhabit this nightmare all the rest
of his days.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>"Poor Bill Clinton."
It is this dimension of Monicagate that is unique in the history of the
presidency. We have had scoundrels, rogues, liars and people who committed
great violence in the job before. But never have we had so hapless a president.
"The Emperor With No Clothes" was supposed to be a fairy tale, not the
literal description of a president whose private parts have actually become
a subject of public discussion.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>From this perspective,
Clinton's mistake is not that he had sex in the Oval Office or lied. It
is something far more serious: He got caught. Presidents can be forgiven
anything so long as they seem powerful enough to protect us. But a president
who is so weak or foolish as to get caught is something that our psyches
are just not prepared for.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>It is amazing how
little public discussion there has been about the role the presidency plays
in our psyches and lives, which is the real issue underlying the Clinton
scandal. It is true, as many have suggested, that CEOs, college professors
and military officers could lose their jobs for denying and then having
to admit having adulterous sex with someone young enough to be their child.
But for no one other than a president could this become a national obsession,
dominate the media for months on end and threaten to paralyze both the
executive and legislative branches of government.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Let us begin with
the basics: A president is different from every other American, all 250
million of them. This has partly to do with power: The president is the
only person we entrust with the authority to use nuclear weapons. That
is, we voluntarily grant the president, and only the president, the right
to kill us and all life on earth.</font></font>
