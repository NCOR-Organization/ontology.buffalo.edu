  <p><img src="../../photos/bennett2.gif" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="190"> <font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Let me begin by congratulating The Heritage Foundation,
  and in particular its president, Ed Feulner, on the Foundation&#146;s 25th anniversary.
  The Heritage Foundation&#146;s contribution to the intellectual life of this nation is
  extraordinary. It is an institution that has had an immeasurably positive impact on the
  modern conservative movement&#151;and the conservative movement has, in turn, had an
  immeasurably positive impact on the last half of this century.</font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">My assigned topic this evening is truth. It
  is a big topic, one as old as Western civilization itself. As a student and former
  professor of philosophy, I first learned what Socrates had to say about truth in
  Plato&#146;s <i>Republic</i>. He said philosophers were men with &quot;no taste for
  falsehood; that is, they are completely unwilling to admit what&#146;s false but hate it,
  while cherishing the truth.&quot; He goes on to tell his young interlocutors,
  &quot;Therefore the man who is really a lover of learning must from youth on strive as
  intensely as possible for every kind of truth.&quot; Plato himself described truth as
  &quot;food of the soul.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a Catholic, I have also learned that the Bible has some
  profound things to say about the truth. Recall the life of Christ. More specifically,
  recall the exchange in the Gospel of John, when Pilate said to Jesus, &quot;Art thou a
  king then?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I
  born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.
  Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice.&quot; Pilate saith unto him, &quot;What is
  truth?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just as some individuals have forever sought and
  proclaimed the truth, there have also always been men who seek to undermine and even kill
  truth&#151;and with it concepts like justice. Pontius Pilate tried. So did a man named
  Thrasymachus, one of Socrates&#146; most notorious critics. In the <i>Republic</i>, he
  said that justice does not truly exist but is merely &quot;the advantage of the
  stronger.&quot; And so said the influential philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who declared,
  &quot;God is dead.&quot; (It turns out, of course, that it is Nietzsche who is dead; God
  remains.) Nietzsche, too, argued in favor of the Will to Power. Like all those before him
  and after who share his view, he understood that if God is dead&#151;if there is no
  truth&#151;then everything is permitted. We create a vacuum that human power will fill.
  Perhaps he understood less well that when we abandon God and truth, the blood begins to
  flow.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The nature, role, and importance of truth is an old topic,
  ladies and gentlemen, an old debate, and an old controversy. I hope to shed some light on
  it tonight by focusing my comments on<i> moral</i> truth.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moral truth is a precious inheritance. It has convinced
  and inspired generations of Americans to dedicate themselves to, in the words of Lincoln,
  &quot;the noblest political system the world ever saw.&quot; Among other things, reliance
  on moral truth has helped this nation declare its independence, abolish slavery, and
  topple the two evil empires of fascism and communism. Moral truth is precious, but today
  it has come under a relentless, withering attack&#151;and the command-and-control center
  is the modern academy.</font></font></p>
  <font size="6"><p><font face="Times New Roman">Moral Truth in the Academy</font></font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The American university is an institution to which I owe a
  great deal. The people and professors I met there opened and deepened my mind in ways I
  never thought possible. They taught me much of what I know today and a lot that I have
  forgotten. And they taught me to consider, and make sense of, moral truths and arguments
  that I&#151;with youthful pretension&#151;wanted to reject. For that I will always be
  grateful.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the universities are also places that, during the past
  25 years, have sorely disappointed me, especially in the humanities. Few things in this
  country are more disturbing and consequential than the transformation of the teaching of
  the humanities on our university campuses. In the matter of the humanities, many
  universities emphasize trends more than truths. In fact, in many universities moral truth
  is not explored or celebrated but damned and deconstructed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You will remember the late (and much missed) Allan Bloom
  as the author of <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>. Professor Bloom told the story
  of a psychology professor he knew who declared that his &quot;function&quot;&#151;an
  interesting word, suggesting a machine-like efficiency&#151;his &quot;function&quot; was
  to rid his students of their beliefs. He insisted that moral truths were simply
  subjective, personal values, the product not of objective reason or divine revelation but
  of whim and prejudice.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The example of the professor is instructive because he is
  so familiar; he is an archetype for the way moral truth is handled in today&#146;s
  universities, places where &quot;high thought&quot; and &quot;higher education&quot; have
  become oxymorons. <i>Everything</i> there is lowered down. No religion, culture, or
  country&#151;no aspiration, idea, or even person&#151;has any claim to truth. Human beings
  are reduced to, and human achievement is understood only through, the lens of race or
  gender, sexual orientation or oppression. That is the lesson being taught in many places
  today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And so, what are we to make of the self-evident moral
  truths claimed in the Declaration of Independence? What about the proposition &quot;that
  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
  rights&quot;? Even this is questionable for many of the intellectuals who walk under the
  philosophical banners of various &quot;isms&quot;&#151;postmodernism, poststructuralism,
  deconstructionism, relativism, and multiculturalism.</font></font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">Today, influential professors proclaim,
  &quot;I do not have much use for notions like &#145;objective value&#146; and
  &#145;objective truth.&#146;&quot; They write that we need to &quot;get to the point where
  we no longer worship anything, where we treat nothing as a quasi divinity, where we treat
  everything&#151;our language, our conscience, our community&#151;as a product of time and
  chance.&quot; We are told, &quot;there is nothing deep down inside us except what we have
  put there ourselves&quot; and &quot;there is no such thing as literal meaning...there is
  no such thing as intrinsic merit.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This belief system leads to chilling conclusions such as,
  &quot;there is no answer to the question &#145;Why not be cruel?&#146;&quot; and
  &quot;what counts as being a decent human being is relative to historical circumstance, a
  matter of transient consensus about what attitudes are normal and what practices are just
  or unjust.&quot; The message to the students is to scrap the quaint, old ideas; get rid of
  moral truth, God-given unalienable rights, and all your antiquarian hang-ups. These things
  can mean nothing because man comes from nothing.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">These modern-day professors, who like to think of
  themselves as clever Socratic gadflies, are actually not much different from Thrasymachus.
  Although they like to think of themselves as liberators&#151;&quot;whatever your heart
  desires&quot; is their charm&#151;what in fact they are liberating their students from is
  the belief that some things are objectively better than others, that some things are right
  and others wrong.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a terrible and discouraging development; emptying,
  flattening, deadening the souls of the young has become the unspoken goal of many
  so-called intellectuals. C. S. Lewis taught us that &quot;the task of the modern educator
  is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts,&quot; but it is the creation of just
  such a desert of the soul that is the result of this new thinking which Professor Bloom
  aptly called &quot;debonair nihilism.&quot; It has rightly been said that when people are
  taught only to doubt, they do not know any more what they may safely believe.</font></font><font size="6"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Moral Truth Outside the University</font></font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the more urgent question&#151;for us tonight and
  for this nation&#151;is whether moral relativism reigns not only within but also beyond
  the walls of American universities. Have the ideas peddled by many intellectuals made
  their way into the mainstream of American life? Do most Americans still believe in
  something called truth? Or are we all moral relativists now?</font></font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">My own observations&#151;based on extensive
  travels, participation on various commissions, conversations with social scientists and
  philosophers, reading of the relevant literature, and my everyday experiences in a suburb
  of Washington, D.C.&#151;is that pure, unalloyed relativism has<i> not</i> spread wide and
  deep across America. Most people (and even most university professors) don&#146;t yet live
  their lives as if they were proud relativists. Most parents are not relativistic when it
  comes to the matter of whether or not their child uses cocaine. Most of us are not
  relativistic when it comes to distinguishing between the lives of Mother Teresa and
  Theodore Kaczynski. And most of us are not relativistic about whether South Africa moves
  from apartheid to democracy, or about whether the Berlin Wall goes up or comes down.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Also, and importantly, no university professor (even an
  Ivy League university professor) wants to encounter hard-core relativists in his everyday
  life. He does not want to deal with students who cheat on tests, or ransack offices, or
  refuse to pay tuition, or burn books, or rob and bludgeon professors, and then justify
  their actions by &quot;deconstructing&quot; rules and laws and &quot;creating their own
  truth.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yet relativism as an idea<i> has</i> made inroads; it has
  established a beachhead in American life&#151;and it will, if allowed to go unchecked and
  unchallenged, do more damage to America, and to Americans. Increasingly we see how
  relativism has manifested itself in different areas of everyday American life. Let me
  mention just a few.</font></font><font size="6"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Supreme Court</font></font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I believe there can be little doubt that the Supreme Court
  has played a part in America&#146;s widespread social disorder. Part of this has to do
  with the lessons the Court teaches through its judicial &quot;reasoning.&quot; Consider
  Justices Souter, Kennedy, and O&#146;Connor&#146;s ominous opinion in the <i>Planned
  Parenthood</i> v. <i>Casey</i> decision, in which they wrote, &quot;At the heart of
  liberty is the right to define one&#146;s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the
  universe, and of the mystery of human life.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Note well: This does not mean merely that you have a right
  to believe what you will, or say what you will, or even live as you will. It is announcing
  something far more sweeping; namely, you have the right to<i> define</i> reality, to make
  reality what you want it to be. In this utterance we see a breathtaking, blatant, proud
  embrace of moral relativism by this country&#146;s most secure and respected branch of
  government. What this pronouncement says is that moral truth can be defined, or defined
  away, simply as one wishes. What this pronouncement means is that the subjective
  definition of truth has received the blessing of the highest court in the land.</font></font></p>
  <font size="6"><p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">Marriage</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The institution of marriage has sustained serious damage
  during the last three decades. Divorce rates are now stuck at around 50 percent. The
  effects of the sexual revolution, no-fault divorce, and out-of-wedlock births have been
  felt. We have reaped the consequences of marriage&#146;s devaluation, reducing it from a
  sacrament, to a contract, to a mere agreement, to a mere arrangement immediately
  dissolvable at the whim of one or the other party.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, many believe that we should shatter the
  traditional definition of marriage in order to include same-sex couples. It has been
  argued by same-sex marriage advocates that the old &quot;single, moralistic&quot; model is
  insufficient and discriminatory. Heterosexual marriage is not the product of natural
  teleology and sexual and human realities but is instead an arbitrary, man-made convention.
  And so this argument against moral truth in marriage&#151;while not yet widely
  embraced&#151;is making headway.</font></font><font size="6"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Children </font></font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We still are without a law prohibiting partial-birth
  abortions, the procedure in which a baby&#146;s skull is punctured and his brains sucked
  out before he has been fully delivered. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the senior
  Democrat from New York, called the procedure &quot;too close to infanticide.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A recent <i>Washington Post </i>column by Fred Hiatt
  reported that in many states, abusers of children receive significantly lighter
  punishments than abusers of animals and it is the latter group&#151;abusers of animals and
  not children&#151;that ignites public outrage. For example, two Kansas men got three years
  each for beating and burning a Yorkshire terrier named Scruffy&#151;and the judge in the
  case had received 5,000 letters demanding harsh punishment. But only last year, a woman in
  Maryland had all but 18 months of her sentence suspended after she was convicted of
  charges of first-degree assault and conspiracy to commit child abuse.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let me tell you the gruesome facts of the case, as
  reported by Hiatt. The woman was convicted of tying five-year-old Richard Holmes to his
  bed with a cat leash for 22 hours a day, injuring his ankles so that he now has trouble
  running and jumping. While he was tied down, the woman repeatedly cut him, force-fed him
  whisky and hot peppers, and taped shut his mouth.</font></font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">There were not 5,000 letters protesting
  this. Nor was there much public outrage when a man in Silver Spring, Maryland, punched and
  shook his seven-week-old baby so hard that the child lapsed into a coma and, weeks later,
  died. The man received a five-year <i>suspended</i> sentence. No jail time. But remember:
  If you can define reality your own way, then it is legitimate and justifiable to lament
  cruelty to dogs more than the torture of children.</font></font><font size="6"></p>
  <p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">Popular Culture and Advertising</font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of our most respected businessmen and artists are
  modern-day relativists. I am referring to corporate leaders who believe in giving people
  whatever they want (so long as there is profit in it), regardless of how degrading it is,
  even if it celebrates misogyny, rape, torture, murder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Look also at some of the new movies. One movie out this
  fall,<i> Happiness</i>, includes the subject of homosexual pedophilia. <i>Happiness</i>
  won the Cannes Film Festival&#146;s Critics&#146; Prize in a rare unanimous sweep;
  according to its writer-director, the movie &quot;might be disturbing, but...it deals with
  longing and isolation and the struggle to connect emotionally and find intimacy.&quot; The
  post-modern attitude toward such things is, &quot;Who is to say it is not right to want
  this? If people want it&#151;if <i>any</i> people want it&#151;it&#146;s okay to make
  it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even in the world of mainstream advertising, we are being
  inundated with messages declaring, &quot;The world has boundaries. Ignore them&quot;
  (Isuzu). We hear the refrain, &quot;Life without limits&quot; (Prince Matchabelli
  perfume). We are told, &quot;It&#146;s not trespassing when you cross your own
  boundaries&quot; (Johnny Walker scotch); &quot;sometimes you gotta break the rules&quot;
  (Burger King); there are &quot;no rules here&quot; (Neiman Marcus); and &quot;All the
  rules have changed&quot; (Woolite).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, no one would argue that each of these small things by
  itself can destroy our belief in moral truth. Each of these is trivial. But no one can
  argue that taken together, these clever and persuasive messages, repeated over and over
  and over, do not influence how we think and alter our frame of reference, our
  sensibilities.</font></font><font size="6"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The American Presidency</font></font><font size="4"></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And sadly, we now have a President of the United States
  who could serve as an advertisement for moral relativism. In his world, words&#151;vows,
  oaths, commitments, and promises&#151;do not have fixed meaning; everything depends on
  subjective interpretation.</font></font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">So the President can declare under oath, to
  a grand jury, with a straight face, against all the evidence, that his lawyer&#146;s
  statement that &quot;there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or
  form&quot; between Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky is true because&#151;and listen to
  these words carefully&#151;&quot;it depends on what the meaning of the word <i>is</i>
  is.&quot; And in explaining how he can defend his false statement, made under oath, that
  he had no recollection of he and Ms. Lewinsky ever having been alone together, the
  President said, &quot;It depends on how you<i> </i>define <i>alone</i>.&quot; Everything
  is up for grabs.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And yet, to many Americans, it seems not to matter. Today,
  it is the case that many Americans seem unsure whether violations of oaths to family, to
  country and Constitution, and to God are serious matters. They aren&#146;t sure if
  character&#151;if truth-telling&#151;in our leaders matters.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have a President who had a sordid, selfish, reckless
  affair with a 21-year-old intern, and who then began a methodical, calculated seven-month
  effort to cover it up. That cover-up consisted of lies to his family, aides, friends,
  lawyers, and Cabinet, and&#151;emphatically and passionately&#151;lies to the American
  people. Our President lied under oath during civil litigation and before a federal grand
  jury. And this President continues to lie to this day.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">And yet many people don&#146;t know what to make of this.
  It seems to them to be a hard and complicated issue, even though the President clearly
  violated his oath of office &quot;to take Care that the Laws be Faithfully executed.&quot;
  In fact, this President&#146;s job approval ratings have gone<i> up</i> since the scandal
  broke and his massive lies have mounted. So what do the American people think of him? One
  can make a plausible argument, I think, that they think rather well of him and want him to
  be left alone.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some critics may say that the examples I have used are
  not, in the language of social science, an adequate or &quot;representative
  sampling.&quot; In response, I would point out that in their 1991 best-selling book,<i>
  The Day America Told the Truth</i>, James Patterson and Peter Kim, two marketing and
  advertising specialists, conducted one of the largest surveys of private morals ever
  undertaken and concluded the following: &quot;Americans are making up their own rules,
  their own laws. In effect, we&#146;re all making up our own moral codes.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would also point critics to Boston University Professor
  Alan Wolfe&#146;s most recent book, <i>One Nation, After All</i>. Professor Wolfe&#146;s
  book, based on fairly in-depth surveys and interviews with average, everyday Americans
  throughout the country, argues that &quot;middle-class Americans have added an Eleventh
  Commandment...: &#145;Thou shalt not judge&#146;.&quot; Wolfe goes on to say that
  &quot;[t]he idea of the &#145;Ten Suggestions&#146; rather than the &#145;Ten
  Commandments&#146; is exactly the tone in which most middle-class Americans believe we
  ought to establish moral rules.&quot; And during his appearance before the National
  Commission on Civic Renewal earlier this year, Professor Wolfe said, &quot;The single most
  surprising finding that I came up with is how unbelievably relativistic Americans
  are.&quot; </font></font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">Remember, these are middle-class Americans,
  not leftist professors, hippies, beatniks, or teenagers. When it comes to moral truth, Mr.
  and Mrs. America have become skeptical, diffident, uncertain, and deeply and proudly
  nonjudgmental.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Part of the explanation of why this has come to pass is
  that there is an allure to untethering ourselves from the claims, and constraints, imposed
  on us by moral truth. The wayward part of man wants to do away with rules because where
  there are no rules, there are no wrongs. &quot;If it feels good, do it&quot; has its
  appeal. This temptation has always existed&#151;but in the past, civilizations have found
  ways to fight back. Today, we seem less sure of our ground and whether we even<i> want</i>
  to fight back.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I also believe many Americans have confused tolerance and
  relativism; often, they assume that tolerance means not merely respecting people&#146;s
  right to their opinions but refusing to make any reasoned judgments about those opinions.
  To put it another way, although it is true that &quot;we all have an equal right to our
  opinions,&quot; it does not follow that &quot;every opinion is equally right.&quot; The
  modern expression of this confusion is the question, &quot;Who am I to judge?&quot; or the
  eight-letter word that in many ways is emblematic of the &#146;90s: &quot;Whatever.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the classical liberal understanding, tolerance means
  according respect to the beliefs and practices of others and learning to live peacefully
  and civilly with one another despite deep differences. Tolerance allows for the &quot;free
  trade in ideas,&quot; which in a fair exchange is the best way to ensure that the right
  beliefs will emerge. It assumes that all reasoned opinions will get a fair hearing, even
  when what is said may not be popular.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So tolerance is a great social good, which is precisely
  why it needs to be rescued from the reckless attempt to redefine it. But we cannot allow
  its meaning to be massively disfigured. The invocation of &quot;tolerance&quot; can be
  genuinely harmful when it becomes a euphemism for moral exhaustion and an indifferent
  neutrality toward moral truth. We do not want &quot;tolerance&quot; to be what G. K.
  Chesterton feared it might become: the virtue of a people who do not believe in anything.</font></font></p>
  <font size="6"><p><font face="Times New Roman">Defending Moral Truth</font></p>
  </font><font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">There is no more important task in
  our time than defending truth against its enemies. To this audience, I need not belabor
  the point that if we give up on objective moral truth, we will not be able to understand
  and fight authentic evil where we find it. Pope John Paul II, in his masterful encyclical<i>
  Veritatis Splendor</i> (<i>The Splendor of Truth</i>), said that societies that deny truth
  inevitably fall into bondage; we are left defenseless against tyranny, brutal repression,
  monstrous lies. &quot;Authentic freedom,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is ordered to truth.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it is. And in a society without respect for moral
  law&#151;a world of &quot;all against all&quot;&#151;it is always the weak, innocent, and
  vulnerable who will suffer most at the hands of the strong, rapacious, and unprincipled.
  In a world where moral truth is denied or repressed, the reality is that&#151;and here I
  come back to those Socratic dialogues&#151;justice means nothing but the &quot;advantage
  of the stronger.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">History has taught us all too well, too regularly, too
  poignantly that intellectual and moral disarmament leads to terror. At the end of this
  bloody, brutal century&#151;with the searing images impressed in mind and memory of
  Auschwitz and Nanking, the Soviet gulag and the Cambodian killing fields&#151;if there is
  one thing we have learned it is that there are horrific human consequences to pernicious,
  evil ideas. And no idea has more consistently done more evil than the idea that there is
  no right or no justice except as dictated by the strong.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But there is also this: The enemies of moral truth have an
  impoverished understanding of<i> reality</i>, of human dignity and the human drama. They
  declare (implicitly or explicitly) that there is nothing worthy to which we should give
  allegiance; nothing deserving of our reverence; nothing elevating for which to live; and
  nothing&#151;not family, country, faith, honor, or truth&#151;for which to sacrifice or
  even die. Theirs is a world that cannot celebrate human excellence or heroism, for it is a
  world where everything is equally good, equally bad, equally meaningless. The real stuff
  of life&#151;its vividness and grandeur, its joy, majesty, and beauty&#151;is thought to
  be illusory.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the relativists are right, then, as Malcolm Muggeridge
  once said, &quot;the cynics, the hedonists, and the suicides would be right. The most we
  can hope for from life is some passing amusement, some gratification of our senses, and
  death.&quot; But as Muggeridge pointed out, that is<i> not</i> all there is. There is more
  to life than shadows and caves. There is also, always, sublime truth.</font></font></p>
  <font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">We need sublime truth today. And like the
  Marines, we desperately need not only a few good men and women who are interested in
  seeking truth&#151;a worthy endeavor for sure&#151;but a few good men and women who are
  interested in defending it.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Several years ago, Saul Bellow wrote that &quot;our
  post-industrial, post-Christian, post-everything period of flux and crisis does not breed
  stingable horses, only millions of gadflies.&quot; Today, we have millions more gadflies
  and not enough stingable horses. What is a stingable horse? It is a person who stands for
  the truth in whatever arena he finds himself and who endures however strong the
  sting&#151;people like Pope John Paul II and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Martin Luther King,
  Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Wilson Reagan.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the defense of truth we must be prudent, large-minded,
  non-censorious, intellectually serious, and morally imaginative. But we must also be
  engaged and purposeful. And perhaps, above all, we must be brave. We must not be afraid.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1938, Winston Churchill gave a speech called
  &quot;Civilization.&quot; I quote:</font></font><font SIZE="3"></p>
  <blockquote>
    </font><font size="4"><p><font face="Times New Roman">But it is vain to imagine that the
    mere perception or declaration of right<i> principles</i>...will be of any value unless
    they are supported by those qualities of civic virtue and manly courage...which in the
    last resort must be the defense of right and reason. Civilization will not last, freedom
    will not survive, peace will not be kept, unless a very large majority of mankind unite
    together to<i> defend</i> them.... [Emphasis added.]</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A half-century later, it is time we again unite
  together&#151;in defense of our civilization, our ancient faith, and truth itself. I will
  close by reminding you of what was said two thousand years ago, in luminous words that
  resonate even now, even still, in the heart of man: We shall know the truth, and the
  truth&#151;and only the truth&#151;shall set us free.</font></font></p>
