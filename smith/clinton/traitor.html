BETRAYS ALL THE FEMINIST IDEALS SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT TO THE REST
OF THE WORLD.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="TIMES"><font color="#663300"><font size=+0>BY NEERA SOHONI</font></font></font>
<br><font face="times"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>BOMBAY -- </font></font><font size=+1><b>S</b>he
is the first lady of a nation that is supposed to lead the world's women
in their "liberation" -- a woman long seen in the Third World as a feminist
and as the epitome of the modern-day "professional" woman.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>Yet in response to charges that her
husband has cheated on her, she has reacted in the manner of the traditionally
oppressed: She has made a public display of loyalty to him, even joining
in his denials. Such actions are reason to question seriously Hillary Rodham
Clinton's credentials as leader and role model, especially for me, as an
Indian woman living in a still overwhelmingly traditional society.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>Here, as in so many other areas of
the world, women experience oppression almost entirely in their private
life -- in their intimate relations. Achieving equality for women in the
public realm has no immediate relevance for those whose knowledge of the
larger world is limited to the television screen.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>Watching Hillary Clinton on television
screens here, one sees her jump to the defense of her husband and his presidency.
But there is an emptiness in her eyes, and also a sort of suppressed womanhood,
as well as distinctive aloneness. One cost of being co-president is clearly
the demise of a more feminist United States.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>During a recent trip to the U.S., I
asked young people at Harvard and Stanford what they thought of Hillary's
behavior through the sex scandal traumatizing her and the presidency.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>To my surprise, very few young women
thought Hillary was being a doormat. Most said they thought the presidency
has its obligations, and marital lapses should be put in perspective. As
one of my own daughters remarked nonchalantly, "But Mom, we don't look
to the president for standards of morality or ethics."</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>Beyond ethics, what worried me was
the lack of interest in assessing or criticizing Hillary's complaisance.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>The possibility that decades of feminist
rethinking of gender roles has been a waste of time is disturbing. The
fact that this realization follows from observing America's first couple
is even more distressing. It is not so much the collapse of another Camelot
as the devaluation of woman's status within marriage that the newest Clinton
affair spotlights.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>The first lady, this Hillary, is no
different from an aunt or cousin or sister, someone we all grew up with
in this part of the world. Faced with an abusive spouse, what did our mothers
advise? "Go back to him, my dear. That is your home. He is your all." Seeing
Hillary act out that advice is the biggest travesty of the current scandal.
What is at stake here is not the ethics of sexual promiscuity but how a
wife should deal with it in terms independent of her husband and child.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>It is painful but necessary to discard
Hillary as a feminist. She fails feminism because she placed herself last
or least or less than her other incarnations -- as wife, as first lady,
as U.S. citizen -- coming eagerly to the defense of an "endangered" presidency.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>If Hillary acts as she does -- stands
by her man -- because she loves him or her daughter too much, then her
claim to being a feminist is open to serious question. If she does it to
protect his presidency, not just her man, then she is a nationalist, not
a feminist. Finally, if she is being steadfast out of her own ambition,
to stay as co-president, she again falls short of the feminist ideal. An
authentic feminist would be honorable only if she sought to hold power
on her own, not as an icon with reflected glory.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>If feminists and the women's movement
feel let down by the present sexual scandal, they have both Clintons to
blame, not just the president.</font></font>
