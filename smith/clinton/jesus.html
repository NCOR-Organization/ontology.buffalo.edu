 <br><font size=+0><p>Clinton as Jesus, Republicans as Sadducees<p> 

                         Bill Clinton, obviously, is no Jesus Christ. . . . But indulge me in a political
                         parable. A besieged conservative establishment that claims absolute
                         custodianship; of a nation's laws furiously defends its dwindling power base
                         against a charismatic upstart from the sticks. Showing a certain blithe
                         contempt for those laws, the new guy challenges the whole concept of what
                         that nation is. <p>Where his opponents have thrived on division and exclusion, he
                         lays hands on just about everyone, rich and poor, sinners and saints, hipsters
                         and squares, red and yellow, black and white, even women. In return, the
                         reward him with a mysteriously enduring faith. . . . <p>

                         These right-wing Republicans are like the Sadducees of the Jewish nation, the
                         reactionary vested interests who carried out their narrow agenda through a
                         strict interpretation of Jewish law--a code in which God's law was inseparable
                         from the nation's law. The Republican's impeachment mantra--"the rule of law
                         "--ostensibly referred to the Constitution. <p>But their conflation of American law
                         and the absolutist word of a fundamentalist's God was made sensationally
                         clear on Saturday, when Speaker-elect Robert Livingston stood in the well of
                         the House and declared himself a sinner, urging his fellow adulterer in the
                         White House to follow his example in abdicating his post. . . . Clinton's
                         arch-enemies, meanwhile, flog the pieties of their "born again" doctrine, even
                         as their most obvious secular icon is the country's corporate grim reaper, the
                         tobacco industry. Theirs is a static vision of humankind as debased and
                         shameful, condemned before a punitive God. <p>

                         . . . That is Clinton's other blasphemy in the eyes of his enemies. By disgracing
                         the sacrosanct office of the presidency, he also demystified the patriarchy that
                         has run the country for its share of the closing millennium. <p>

 Just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse...I guess these people have completely taken leave of their collective senses. It's Alice in Wonderland time, folks.<br>
