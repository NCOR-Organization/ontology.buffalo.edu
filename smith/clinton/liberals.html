                   The Death of Liberal Outrage<p>

                   By Patrick H. Caddell, who served as a pollster and
                   strategist in the presidential campaigns of George McGovern, Jimmy
                   Carter, Gary Hart and Walter Mondale; and Marc Cooper, a
                   contributing editor of The Nation.<p>

                   Democrats in Congress have a point when they accuse President Clinton's
                   critics of politicizing the law. Republicans cross the limits of credibility when
                   they inflate the seriousness of Mr. Clinton's transgressions into the
                   equivalent of Watergate or Iran-contra. But we expect our Republican
                   adversaries to act that way. What discourages us more has been the
                   behavior of our friends, Mr. Clinton's defenders on the left.<p>

                   We can only hope that when they stood vigil for Mr. Clinton last week on
                   Capitol Hill, led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, they said a prayer for Rickey
                   Ray Rector. For Rector's story symbolizes how liberals have sheared off
                   their principles in order to squeeze into that little black box that is Mr.
                   Clinton's moral universe.<p>

                   In early 1992, as then-Gov. Clinton struggled to
                   salvage his presidential candidacy in the face of the
                   Gennifer Flowers scandal, convicted murderer
                   Rector sat on Arkansas's death row. When his time
                   came for execution, Mr. Clinton flew home from
                   New Hampshire just in time to deny Rector a stay
                   of execution. Rector, an African-American, had
                   turned his gun on himself after killing a police officer
                   at his mother's house. He blew his brains out, but he
                   survived--condemned to function with the mind of a
                   five-year-old. As he was put on his feet to walk to
                   the death chamber, and with no trace of irony,
                   Rector asked his guards to say hello to Gov.
                   Clinton, whom he had just seen on television, and to save Rector his slice of
                   pecan pie, which he planned to eat when he returned.<p>

                   It mattered not to Gov. Clinton that the law prohibited the execution of
                   someone not competent to understand his crime or his punishment. Rector's
                   life was an insignificant price for candidate Clinton to pay to demonstrate his
                   tough "New Democrat" credentials. In the days following the execution, as
                   Mr. Clinton campaigned in the South, he proudly pointed to his willingness
                   to enforce the death penalty.<p>

                   Where were the liberals? No Hollywood celebrities--no Rob Reiner, no
                   Barbra Streisand--lobbied to spare Rector's life. There were no NYU
                   emergency speak-outs organized by Sean Wilentz and Arthur Schlesinger
                   Jr. on Rector's behalf. No panels of Ivy League law professors with Alan
                   Dershowitz screaming for due process. Rep. Maxine Waters was too
                   wrapped up co-chairing Mr. Clinton's California campaign to invoke
                   her--and Rector's--"slave ancestors" in a cry for justice as she would six
                   years later on the House floor on behalf of her president. The blatantly
                   pro-Clinton reporters who covered the 1992 campaign--Sidney
                   Blumenthal, Eleanor Clift, Strobe Talbott, Joe Klein--barely found time to
                   hiccup over the outrageous execution of Rickey Ray Rector.<p>

                   A year later when Marshall Frady in The New Yorker wrote a chilling
                   deconstruction of Clinton's political decision to execute Rector, one of us
                   asked a number of Clinton supporters if they believed Mr. Clinton would
                   have executed Rector if he had not been campaigning for president. To a
                   person, their answer was a sheepish no. But they had chosen to remain
                   silent. Such complicity, they argued, was for the greater good--the greater
                   good of finally having a Democrat in the White House. Bill Clinton might not
                   exactly be a new FDR but he was, after all, "electable."<p>

                   In the past six years, liberals have continued their defense of the Clinton
                   presidency, paying a staggering price: unconditional surrender of their ideals.<p>

                                     Where was the Democratic outrage when in the first
                                     months of the Clinton administration 83 men,
                                     women and children were immolated by federal
                                     agents at Waco? The same Democrats now
                                     bleating about the violation of Mr. Clinton's rights
                                     were eerily silent when, as the 1996 re-election
                                     campaign was beginning, the president signed the
                                     Effective Death Penalty Act--a dastardly law that
                                     quashes nearly all legal appeals from death row.<p>

                                     Democrats denounce the violation of the president's
                                     right to privacy. But they have nothing to say when
                                     his administration proposes to legalize "roving"
                   wiretaps. They are equally mum on the immigration bill signed by Mr.
                   Clinton that virtually abolished due process and this year alone has resulted
                   in more than 30,000 summary deportations, in many cases of long-term
                   legal residents. And when Mr. Clinton signed the 1996 welfare bill, which
                   requires unwed mothers to name their children's fathers on pain of
                   prosecution, it was left to Jesse Jackson to snuff out the moral fires. When
                   liberals pondered their options of protest at the 1996 Democratic
                   Convention, Mr. Jackson loudly barked the stray dissenters back into the
                   fold.<p>

                   Likewise, in the current Monicagate fiasco, mainstream feminist
                   organizations have shredded two decades of hard-earned gains in sexual
                   harassment law. True, Paula Jones's case was exploited by Clinton haters.
                   But that's no excuse for the White House to attack her as "trailer trash" or
                   for Mr. Clinton, as a defendant in a sexual harassment case, to lie under
                   oath. Since when is it the task of liberal feminists to intentionally confuse this
                   repugnant act of perjury with what they disingenuously call "just lying about
                   sex"?<p>

                   But the most disturbing consequence of the surrender to Clinton has been
                   the self-strangulation of the Democratic peace constituency. In August Mr.
                   Clinton ordered missile attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan within days of his
                   disastrous speech about Monicagate. When credible news reports surfaced
                   that the plant demolished by U.S. rockets in the Sudan was a benign
                   pharmaceuticals factory, former President Carter courageously called for an
                   investigation. But Democratic officeholders ignored Mr. Carter's call.<p>

                   The refusal to speak out on the possible Sudan deception led us directly to
                   last week's tragedy of Operation Desert Fox. As the missiles exploded in
                   Iraq, Democrats cheered. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and
                   Minority Whip David Bonior--both of whom voted against the 1991 Gulf
                   War and argued for the right to publicly challenge the wisdom of George
                   Bush's decision--this time pontificated shamelessly about threats to national
                   security. The low point came when Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D., R.I.) on the
                   House floor resurrected--nearly word for word-- the scurrilous language
                   LBJ White House's used in 1966 when it questioned the patriotism of his
                   uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, who had begun to speak out against the
                   Vietnam War. Rep. Kennedy even suggested that Congress should ask the
                   CIA for permission to go ahead with the impeachment debate.<p>

                   As last week came to close, American liberals staged a bizarre televised
                   pageant of moral suicide. On one channel you could view a third wave of a
                   suspiciously timed American air attack rain down on Baghdad, cruise
                   missiles exploding at a million dollars a pop. On another channel, at the
                   same moment, there were the Rev. Mr. Jackson and the cream of liberalism
                   rallying on the Capitol steps, joining hands and intoning "We Shall
                   Overcome"--praying not for the victims of our ordnance, but for the
                   prevaricating president who signed their death warrant.<p>

                   The Iraqi people pay their own special price for Monicagate. But we all
                   suffer the collateral damage of this crisis. For their partisan zeal, their failure
                   to distinguish between adultery and crimes of the state, and their bulldozer
                   congressional tactics, the Republicans earned last month's electoral defeat
                   and are now saddled with a couple of high-profile corpses named Gingrich
                   and Livingston. But Democrats and liberals, with their loftier ideals, have
                   fallen further. Many Congressional Democrats privately scorn Mr. Clinton,
                   for his policies and his behavior, with an intensity that rivals the open hatred
                   of GOP Rep. Bob Barr. But for narrow partisan political ends, they are
                   willing to hollow out their consciences and close ranks.<p>

                   We don't think the Senate should remove Mr. Clinton from office for the
                   crimes the Republicans have charged him with. But if he is eventually
                   hoisted on his own petard of the politicization of the rule of law, our sorrow
                   for him will be tempered with the knowledge that--unlike Rickey Ray
                   Rector, whose ghost now hunches anxiously over our shoulders--Bill
                   Clinton will physically survive his political sacrifice. The last supper of his
                   presidency is being paid for with the bankrupting of the liberal moral
                   treasury. Unlike Rector, Mr. Clinton will be able to enjoy his dessert. His
                   historical disgrace, however, will be his just deserts.<p>

 This was a great article, because it solidified for me one of the great mysteries:  Why are these liberals supporting Clinton so strongly when he has sold them out on many occasions?  And what's wrong with Al Gore?
<p>
Here is the answer: <i>Clinton is a Democrat who is electable.</i>  They know that no liberal who was honest about his views could possibly be elected in a national election.  Clinton was the best they could do.  And while Clinton may sell them out from time to time, behind Clinton and operating virtually without notice is an army of dedicated liberals (socialists) headed by Hillary.  They know that if he goes, the whole army will be swept aside.  It is not Clinton himself, but the liberal "shadow government" under him that they are protecting.<br>

 And this is how our nation is coming more and more to
resemble Germany when Hitler became Chancellor.  Those who
have historically defended human rights and human dignity
have sacrificed their ethics and morals for their new fuhrer.
Alan Keyes was absolutely right when he said that Clinton
is "plowing the ground for a dictator."  The seeds have
been sown - now we wait to see what the harvest will be.<br>

 The statement of the clinton aides about the execution"it was for the greater good,a democrat in the presidency",says it all.I now understand the willingness of clinton sycophants to look the other way.That statement sounds very similar to those uttered in nazi Germany.<br>

 <i>Watergate or Iran-contra. But we expect our Republican adversaries to act that way</i>

....Please 
<p>
I don't agree with any of this, save the shots on Clinton.
<p>
Liberal gobblygook.  Left brain/right brain flip flops.
<p>
Current liberalism is - You do whatever you feel like doing, including breaking your own laws - to get ahead adn defend it later with foucus-group tested words on s teleprompter.
<p>
There's no grandious plan out there, folks.  Just beat up the 'Pubs and put fear into people.<br>

 <i> the Republicans earned last month's electoral defeat and are now saddled with a couple of high-profile corpses named Gingrich and Livingston. But Democrats and liberals, with their <b>loftier ideals</b>, have fallen further</i><p>
Despite the 'toon bashing, this says a lot.  They still
think they are better than Republicans, but think they
at least have some morals to stand on compared to the
scum supporting the first felon.  Make no mistake, people
like this are no friends of the bubba's foes.<br>

 <I>" The last supper of his presidency is being paid for with the bankrupting of the
liberal moral treasury. Unlike Rector, Mr. Clinton will be able to enjoy his dessert. His historical disgrace, however, will be his just deserts."</i><P>
Then this disastrous rule we are suffering under will not all have been in vain then. 
<P> This article, reminds me in some ways of the beginning notes of the change by Abe Rosenthal. It has the obligatory slams at Republicans.. the obligatory trashing of them, and all they stand for, but in the middle is a condemnation of a flawed man and his followers. 
<P>
As Gary says.. this does explain the mystery of why some liberals still support him. <br>

A wise man once said:<p>
"You are who you pretend to be - so <i>be careful who you pretend to be.</i>"<p>
I get the feeling that these Democrats want to excuse their flagrant, destructive public support for Impeached Bill by the declaration that, "oh, in <i>private </i>we detest this scumbag as much as anyone else."  The reality is that there is no such thing as "private" politics - politics is the art of what people do in public.<p>
