 <em>MICHAEL IGNATIEFF</em>
 <br><font size=+0><p><P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">LONDON -- It seems incredible now that Lionel Trilling could have written<BR>in 1950 that &quot;liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole<BR>intellectual tradition&quot; in America. This wasn't true even then: Trilling<BR>blithely ignored the vigorous life of American conservatism and radicalism. <BR><BR>He also failed to foresee just how brief the liberal ascendancy would be: from<BR>Roosevelt's second inaugural in 1937 through to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society,<BR>with the Civil Rights Act of 1965 as American liberalism's last hurrah. <BR><BR>Since then, retreat has been the order of the day. Though not the toxic label it<BR>was earlier in the 1990's, liberalism remains the politics that dares not speak its<BR>name. In their strong electoral showing last week, the Democrats successfully<BR>depicted themselves as moderates, not liberals. <BR><BR>But these hedgings make for a political discourse that denies some important<BR>realities. Americans who despise the very word liberalism actually live within a<BR>polity ordered by liberal institutions, like Social Security and Medicare. <BR><BR>The rhetoric of American politics requires Democrats and Republicans alike to<BR>praise the free market, but every day bankers and traders actually pray that<BR>market regulators like Alan Greenspan, chairman of that eminently Rooseveltian<BR>institution, the Federal Reserve, will deliver them from the ravages of markets red<BR>in tooth and claw. <BR><BR>This paradox -- made familiar by John Kenneth Galbraith -- seems to do nothing<BR>to restore liberalism's prestige. Its political achievements cannot rescue its moral<BR>status. For the real obstacle to liberalism's revival is its association with moral<BR>relativism. The liberal hour ushered in the moral and sexual revolution of the<BR>1960's, only to be devoured by it after 1968. It was then, as Middle America<BR>reacted to the new-found freedoms of its sons and daughters, that Richard Nixon<BR>became the first politician to discover that he could ride all the way to the White<BR>House by equating liberalism with permissiveness. <BR><BR>But this, too, was paradoxical: even as Americans voted for politicians who ran<BR>against the 60's and all of that decade's supposedly diabolical experimentation, the<BR>larger culture slowly embraced the permissive revolution: freer divorce, more<BR>sexual explicitness, more tolerant attitudes toward homosexuality. The liberal<BR>causes of the 60's won out, and American society is more inclusive and open as a<BR>result. <BR><BR>But liberalism paid the price of losing its own moral legitimacy. It was seen rightly<BR>as being both too permissive on the one hand and too dismissive on the other of<BR>the family values of most Americans. <BR><BR>In retrospect, the reasons for the conservatives' ascendancy in the 1970's seem<BR>clear. They had proved more adept than liberals at understanding the anxiety and<BR>unease of a generation living through rapid moral change. Conservatism had the<BR>virtue of nostalgic simplicity: it preached &quot;values,&quot; preferably ones with divine<BR>sanction. In doing so, it effectively associated liberalism with relativism, with<BR>&quot;anything goes.&quot; <BR><BR>But in the late 1990's, the conservative counter-revolution is encountering<BR>difficulties of its own. &quot;Values&quot; are anything but the rigid moral compass that<BR>conservatives suppose. For values conflict. Even for the devout and the faithful,<BR>there is no rock of ages to cling to. <BR><BR>As the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin has persuasively argued, the abortion<BR>issue is not a debate, as conservatives contend, between those who hold life<BR>sacred and those who don't. It is a furious, even violent confrontation between<BR>people who believe equally in the special importance of human life but derive<BR>radically different practical conclusions from that shared moral premise. <BR><BR>Likewise, the debate about the conduct of President Clinton is not, as many<BR>conservatives claim, between those who don't care about immorality and those<BR>who do. It is between those who believe that private immorality forfeits public<BR>trust and those who do not. And if public immorality -- that is, perjury -- is in<BR>question, the debate is between those who believe equivocation in any court of<BR>law is wrong and those who believe exceptions can be made if the court in<BR>question is actually a witch trial. <BR><BR>In the largest terms, this is a debate not between relativists and conservatives, but<BR>between pluralists and absolutists. <BR><BR>Liberals, I would argue, should be pluralists, not relativists: their claim should be<BR>not that objective standards of moral behavior don't exist, but that public and<BR>private standards conflict. <BR><BR>M oral judgment is inescapable, but it requires, at a minimum, an understanding of<BR>which moral standards are relevant to which arena. Judging from the failure of the<BR>moral absolutists to convict President Clinton in the court of American opinion, it<BR>appears that most Americans are practicing pluralists. That is, they believe there<BR>are absolute standards of private and public conduct but they do not suppose<BR>that these both point in the same direction. <BR><BR>They know that there have been good Presidents who have been less than perfect<BR>human beings, and fine fathers and husbands who turned out to be indifferent<BR>Presidents. They think that while lying is a bad thing, not all lies are equally bad. <BR><BR>A majority appear to believe that the stability of government institutions is<BR>jeopardized if the law becomes the instrument of politically motivated moral<BR>absolutism. <BR><BR>If this is how Americans are making their moral choices, it would appear that the<BR>times are right for liberalism, for a revival of a political mode of thought that takes<BR>its stand not only against moral absolutism and its intolerance, but also against its<BR>absurd and sometimes violent simplifications. <BR><BR>Yet simplifications are seductive and pluralism is complex. <BR><BR>Liberalism's revival does not just require politicians with the courage to talk to<BR>Americans in a manner that respects their moral intelligence. It also requires an<BR>intellectual revival that gets the distinction between relativism and pluralism clear. <BR><BR>Conservatives will insist that the one is just a fancy name for the other. But as<BR>Isaiah Berlin argued in &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty,&quot; a relativist believes morals are a<BR>matter of taste and inclination; a pluralist believes adherence to moral standards is<BR>not a matter of taste but the very definition of what it is to be a human being. <BR><BR>The mistake absolutists make is to suppose, first, &quot;that all values can be graded on<BR>one scale,&quot; in Berlin's words, and, second, that values must have divine sanction. <BR><BR>Not so, Berlin insisted: &quot;Principles are not less sacred because their duration<BR>cannot be guaranteed.&quot; We choose one moral principle over another. Every<BR>choice entails loss, but the act of free choice is what defines us as human. <BR><BR>Liberalism has always derived its authority and persuasiveness from this vision of<BR>human nobility, from this idea that our dignity is derived from the exercise of<BR>moral choice. Moral absolutism fears this act of choice and fears the freedom<BR>required by the act of choosing. <BR><BR>Liberalism depends, ultimately, on faith in human choosing, and a liberal revival<BR>depends on recovering the inspiration of this central conviction. </FONT></BODY></HTML></p></font><hr> <p><font size=+0></font></p>
