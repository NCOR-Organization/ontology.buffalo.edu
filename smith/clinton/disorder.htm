<p>1. INTRODUCTION
<p>1A. A physician writes to the journal <u>Medical</u> <u>Aspects</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Human</u> <u>Sexuality</u>, asking this question:
<p><i>A male patient, thirty-something, supposedly happily married, good
sex life, and father of three children, continues to masturbate with fantasies
of flagellation of females. His wife has no knowledge of this portion of
his life. What can I do to help him overcome his fantasy?</i>
<p>What do we have here, disorder or diversity?
<p>Answer #1:
<p>If the individual is happily married and does have a good sex life with
his wife ..., then his distress can be relieved by reassuring him that
sexual fantasies are common components of normal human experience. Fantasies
of flagellation are quite common and in themselves innocuous.... One of
the many variations by which people express sexuality are the fantasies
and accompanying masturbation; they should be accepted as a legitimate
part of a person's individual sexual pattern.<sup>1</sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The activity does no harm; let's respect individual patterns, in the
name of pluralism or diversity.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Answer #2:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A man who needs fantasies of beating females in order to enjoy sex cannot
be happily married or have a "good" sex life. Why? Because he hates women,
and undoubtedly his wife most of all. Since he has three children, we can
work on the assumption that he has had intercourse with his wife at least
three times--although it is possible they are not his. Of what portion
of his life has he not told her? About masturbation? Or about being a homosexual--which
is one good possibility here. Anyone having fantasies like these MUST be
... a tormenting and frustrating person to live with.<sup>2</sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>*****
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A woman writes to <u>Cosmopolitan</u>, asking this question:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>I'm thirty-four, successful, smart, independent ... [but] <u>obsessed</u>
by the ... fantasy of being spanked by a lover. What's <u>wrong</u> with
me?</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Answer:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Nothing's ... wrong with you.... The desire to spank or be spanked ...
by a partner is, in fact, quite common.... When erotic fantasies become
reality, they sometimes lose their power, but I see no harm in giving this
one a try.... Next time you and a beau are getting intimate, why not confess
you've been a naughty girl? Then climb over his knee ... and savor your
punishment.<sup>3</sup>

<p>We need a matchmaker to get these two letter-writers together.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1B. The debate among feminists rages as to whether lesbian S/M, let
alone heterosexual S/M, let alone <u>any</u> heterosex (which by its essence
is sadomasochistic) is compatible or incompatible with feminist principles.
On the one side, is Mann's pluralistic respect for "individual patterns"
and Kurtz's implication that something that is so common is innocuous.
But on the other side is, for example, the doubts about liberalism expressed
by feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon (<u>FU</u>, p. 15):
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Tolerance is the solution liberalism offers. A very substantive sexual
blackmail lies at the heart of this liberal tolerance. In order not to
criticize anyone's sexuality [in the name of pluralism and respect for
individual patterns], it is women, specifically, who are used and abused
by men, women who are sacrificed.... [T]he defense of lesbian sadomasochism
would sacrifice all women's ability to walk down the street in safety for
the freedom to torture a woman in the privacy of one's basement ..., in
the name of everyone's freedom of [sexual] choice.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Perhaps this criticism is on to something, because a philosophy of pluralism
and diversity is perennially plagued by a "demarcation problem," as pointed
out by the writer Daphne Merkin:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[S]ometime in the past three decades we seem to have lost our balance
about things sexual. What is normal? What is [not]? Jeffrey Dahmer is surely
everyone's idea of a sickie.... What, however, is one to make of Prince
Charles, longing to be Camilla Parker Bowles's tampon? ... [W]here do you
draw the line? ... We know only that heterosexuality has ceded its automatic
right-of-way [and] that the dark continent of sadomasochism has been domesticated
into a household state of mind.... Indeed, many of us prefer, perversely,
the anticipation of sex to the thing itself." [<u>The New Yorker</u>, Jan.
1994]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Not Merkin, however; she confesses that, like the woman who submitted
her question to
<u>Cosmopolitan</u>, she had fantasies about being sexually
spanked. "I had fantasized about this event for so long that in the back
of my mind there had always lurked the fear that its gratification would
prove disappointing. I needn't have worried: the reality of spanking ...
was as good as the dream." (<u>The New Yorker</u>, March 1996)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>These men and women, whether straight or gay, who fantasize about
and perhaps engage in S/M activities: is this merely diversity, a case
of "chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t," and we should respect their individual
sexual patterns, or is it some kind of disorder--a sexual perversion, psychological
infirmity, an unhealthy response to pernicious socialization, a sign of
a damaged personality or of a corrupt soul, or something akin to heroine
addiction or diabetes? That is the question. But why even <i>ask</i> the
"diversity or disorder" question? What do we hope to gain by answering
it?</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1C. Let's turn to gay male promiscuity for a moment: is <i>this</i>
a disorder or merely a mark of diversity? And why ask and answer the question?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The philosopher Michael Levin, for example, thinks that a gay male who
has had 100-500 sexual partners exhibits "maladjustment and compulsivity,
a chronic inability to find anyone satisfactory." He also thinks that inserting
the penis into another man's rectum is not what the penis "is for."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It is clear what Levin's agenda is; he wants to use a Thomistic theory
of the hard-wiring of human sexuality to defend social practices that are
unfriendly to gays. Levin's view is, I think, held by a large number of
American Christians. This may be why some contemporary scientists are so
anxious to prove that homosexuality has a genetic, endocrinological, and
brain-anatomical basis--they, too, hope to gain some political leverage
out of their alternative explanation: gays are gay because Nature, or God
in His infinite wisdom of pluralistic plentitude, made them that way.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Similarly, the sociobiologist Donald Symons has argued (<u>The Evolution
of Human Sexuality</u>) that gay promiscuity is a sign of the normal male
tendency to seek multiple sexual partners, unhindered, in the case of gays,
by a need to accommodate to women's less adventuresome sexual nature; the
promiscuous gay male is the heterosexual male writ large. Again in contrast
to Levin, but without the naturalistic trappings, the gay British historian
Jeffrey Weeks praises homosexuality: "the most distinctive aspect of gay
life is its 'radical pluralism'." Weeks claims that "the diversity of human
sexuality in <u>all</u> its variant forms" is "the most radical aspect
of gay culture." Homosexuality maximizes the "erotic possibilities of the
body, and that is why it is taboo"--because it celebrates pluralism.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In a fascinating paper with the pregnant title "Is the Rectum a Grave?,"
the Freudian crit-lit scholar Leo Bersani replies to Weeks:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The argument for diversity has the strategic advantage of making gays
seem like passionate defenders of one of the primary values of mainstream
liberal culture.... The revulsion [to homosexuality], it turns out, is
all a big mistake; what [we--gays--are] really up to is pluralism and diversity,
and getting buggered is just one moment in the practice of those laudable
humanistic virtues.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>If Weeks is wrong about the meaning of gay promiscuity, how should it
be understood? Bersani takes this route:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Gay men's "obsession" with sex, far from being denied, should be celebrated
[why?]--<u>not because</u> of its communal virtues [the democracy of the
baths], <u>not because</u> of its subversive potential for parodies of
machismo [but isn't that valuable?], <u>not because</u> [as Weeks has it]
it offers a model of genuine pluralism to a society that at once celebrates
and punishes pluralism,
<b>but rather because</b> it never stops re-presenting
the internalized phallic male as an infinitely loved object of sacrifice.
Male homosexuality advertises the risk of the sexual itself as the risk
of self-dismissal, of <u>losing sight</u> of the self, and in so doing
it ... dangerously represents <u>jouissance</u> as a mode of ascesis. [self-discipline,
asceticism]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I don't know you read this, but "<u>jouissance</u> as a mode of ascesis"
sounds pretty disordered to me.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________
<p>Bersani's theory: Sexually constitutive masochism is "an evolutionary
conquest in the sense that it allows the infant to survive, indeed to find
pleasure in, the painful and characteristically human period during which
infants are shattered with stimuli for which they have not yet developed
defensive or integrative ego structures." [An explanation for passive sadomasochism/
receptive homosexuality/the joy of female, submissive sexuality: "the oppression
of women disguises a fearful male response to the seductiveness of an image
of sexual powerlessness".]
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Camille Paglia expresses a similar critique of happy-face pluralism:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>We must frankly face the mutilations and horrors in [Robert] Mapplethorpe's
sexual world and stop trying to blandly argue them away as fun and frolics
of "an alternative lifestyle." His grim sadomasochists are not lovable,
boppy Venice Beach eccentrics on roller skates.... Sadomasochism is a sacred
cult, a pagan religion that reveals the dark secrets of nature. The bondage
of sadomasochism expresses our own bondage by the body, our subservience
to its brute laws, concealed by our myths of romantic love.... It is nature,
not society, that is our greatest oppressor.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>2. Let us return to the meta-question: why ask and answer the "disorder
or diversity" question at all? Why explain homosexual promiscuity, or homosexuality?
Why inquire about the bona fides of our S/M friends?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There was a brief article in <u>The New Yorker</u> last November about
a colloquium on the science wars that was held at NYU. The following issue
arose: most scientists claim that Native Americans came to North America
via the Bering Strait about 10,000 years ago. The Indians themselves have
a different belief about their origins: their ancestors arose, fully formed,
from a subterranean spirit world (apparently near Butte, Montana). Native
American Creationism denies evolution.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>About the disagreement between anthropology and Native American Creationism,
Alan Sokal, a physicist at NYU, expressed this view: these two claims are
incompatible; perhaps both are false, but at the very least not both anthropology
and the Indians can be right, and one <u>must</u> be false; as far as we
can tell using the best scientific procedures, the first view is true and
the second is false or, at best, meaningless nonsense. Canons of rationality
tell against the Indians.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Andrew Ross, a humanities scholar, replied to Sokal at the colloquium:
"Why would you choose [to ask and answer] a question [about origins] that
would put on trial Native Americans?" ... "Why ..., in a polarizing way,
are we asked to decide this question?" His point was this: impugning the
beliefs of Native Americans could only have the effect of damaging them,
their culture, their ethnic viability, their future.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Now, is Ross's view a defense of pluralism and diversity, expressing
respect for individual cultural patterns? No. Ross is making a political
point that stops short of blessing all diversity: the Native Americans
are harmless creatures who mind their own business, so leave them alone.
Would Ross also say: "Why would you want to ask, in a polarizing way, whether
Christ really rose on the third day and is he really the son of God, born
to a virgin? Why put Christians on trial? Leave them alone." I doubt it.
Nor would Ross defend Biblical Creationism, which also denies evolution.
Fundamentalism doesn't deserve similar postmodernist protection because
it is not politically correct; this creationism, as opposed to Native American
creationism, is too closely associated with a politics that Ross dislikes.
Ross takes as "central" the "cuddly [vanilla] minorities: native peoples
[and] beleaguered immigrants..... [But there is] a whole other class of
vicious ethnic groups [the Serbs] with which we feel far less ... sympathy."
(Robert Goodin in <u>Ethics</u>.) Ross is not a genuine pluralist--nor
is he defending, as I do for the purposes of this lecture, a thoroughgoing
relativism.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The upshot of Ross's view is that Sokal's quest for truth and rationality
needs to be tempered by, or even sacrificed to, the quest for justice.
So, why ask and answer the "diversity or disorder" question about our friends
who enjoy sadomasochistic sex or who are homosexual? To defend them? To
condemn them? &Agrave; la MacKinnon, to protect Everywoman?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Is there a truth about these things that we can arrive at--on the basis
of, say, criteria of harm or consent or nature--or are there more important
social and political values at stake that might, <i>pace</i> [pah-chay/kay]
Ross, make the question one we should not raise at all? I'm going to explore
this possibility: that there is no either/or here, between Sokal's wanting
the truth and Ross's engagement with normative matters, for aiming at a
truth about <u>these</u> matters, at least, is ultimately a value project
anyway. In a nutshell, I am going to push relativism as far as I can.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. So, now, with the Introduction out of the way, let us begin. I want
to start with the concept of "harm." A popular version of liberal pluralism
says that anything goes--just don't cause any harm. This view is reasonable.
But I want to explore its weak underbelly, in an attempt to defend an even
more extreme relativism.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Three cases</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3A. In the highlands of New Guinea, the Sambia and Etoro natives engage
in a practice that American academics call "fellatio insemination": young
boys (7 to 12 years old) fellate older unmarried men to orgasm and drink
the ejaculate. In these cultures, the ejaculate is considered nourishment,
something young boys need to ingest in order to mature; the act is a piece
of essential nurturing, on analogy with breast-feeding. The men who supply
the ejaculate lose some of their masculine power, so their providing the
nourishment is self-consciously conceived as a gift. As the anthropologist
Gilbert Herdt observes, "Homoerotic play is culturally defined as an unequal
exchange of commodities: recipients acquire semen, donors get sexual services.
This exchange is unequal because ... a man's sperm is being depleted, but
he gets only [insubstantial, relatively worthless] erotic pleasure in return."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[How about that as a way to justify coerced sex! It is actually good
for the coerced person. But we use this justification for the ubiquitous
coercion of children. Recall the exchange between Socrates and Alcibiades
in Plato's <u>Symposium</u>.]
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Why ask questions about this practice? Do we want to intervene? Catholic
missionaries, I suspect, would enjoy re-educating the Sambia and Etoro,
teaching them an objective notion of the natural and explaining to them
why paedophiliac fellatio is immoral and perverted and damages the spirit.
Shall we, less obnoxiously, put a boycott on their exportable products?
Isn't their practice based on false or irrational beliefs? And isn't it
also, in our terms, harmful? Maybe so, but not in <u>their</u> terms. Furthermore,
the boys grow up to be heterosexuals, to marry, and to father children,
adequately socialized and well-adjusted, apparently as happy-go-lucky as
anyone could be in the New Guinea highlands (or the Louisiana bayou)--despite
the fact that their beliefs (e.g., semen is an essential nutrient) are
false or irrational.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>According to Pat Califia (a lesbian sadomasochist, in theory and in
practice):
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[A]ny child old enough to decide whether or not she or he wants to eat
spinach, play with trucks or wear shoes is old enough to decide whether
or not she or he wants to run around naked in the sun, masturbate, sit
in someone's lap or engage in sexual activity.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Perhaps we patronize children by discounting their interest in engaging
in sex among themselves or with adults; maybe children have <u>bona fide</u>
sexual needs that should be attended to by those who are concerned for
their well-being; and perhaps children express real desire for sexual activity
with adults, even if this desire is not fully formed and is shown in ambiguous
ways. Our evaluation of paedophilia (pc-term: "intergenerational sex")
depends on our notion of consent, our notion of harm, and our "ultimate
beliefs" about the significance of sexuality. If children can participate
in fellatio insemination in Sambian culture, why not allow similar things
in our culture, unencumbered, of course, by false or irrational beliefs
about nourishment?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Another case: TV Show, October '96 ("Dark Skies"): A woman character
who became a Las Vegas prostitute had been initiated into sex on her 13th
birthday by her father. We can imagine a society in which this was the
usual practice, with either social or religious ceremonies; what harm occurs?
Arranged marriages for girls at the age of 12 in Iraq, orchestrated by
both parents. Iraqi parents did this in the U.S. A talking head (a woman)
on CNN said: women have a human right not to be married against their will
and at such a young age. Oh?--a universal, objective and monistic moral
truth? If it is O.K. in Iraq, why not here, we who are supposed to be a
pluralist culture with religious freedom?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3B. Among Native Australians, there is a practice that they call "men's
menstruation": a man jabs his penis, which has been made erect by masturbation,
with a razor, and he bores the urethra with barbed vegetal catheters [ouch!];
the man thinks erotic heterosexual thoughts during the procedure to make
it less traumatic. (I would have tried baseball.) As a result of "cultural
cathexis," as the anthropologist David Tuzin nicely puts it, "the psychological
significance of penile incision is transformed from being an unmitigated
horror into being something <b>subjectively positive</b>."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This practice is believed (we would say "falsely" or "irrationally"--not
they, of course) by the natives to cleanse the body of noxious feminine
substances and to have beneficial effects on the man's general health.
It is also done as the "ritual climax of the honeymoon," in order that
the marriage be blessed by fruitfulness. The men later take pride in their
wounds.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>To generalize from these two cases: nothing is bad, nothing is harmful,
not even extreme physical damage, except thinking makes it so. We need
consider only dentistry and other surgical procedures that physicians are
always foisting on us: we endure these invasions, and judge them good,
not "harm," only because we believe they will do us some good (and we believe
this not always rationally, according to our own notion of "rational").
This is a severe problem for any attempt to use harm as a criterion to
make <u>cross-cultural</u> "diversity or disorder" judgments. Even the
most painful acts, such as slicing one's own erect penis, are endured,
even celebrated, if they cohere with and are justified by a metaphysical
belief system.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3C. This point applies not only cross-culturally, however: consider
the Rancho Sante Fe suicides. These people, members of Heaven's Gate, believed
that in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet there was a spaceship that would
take them to a better world; the superhumans on the craft, who occupy the
next level of existence in the Great Chain of Being, were to give them
new bodies. [A fine question: will the resurrected flesh include testicles?]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Crazy ideas, no? But (as my students say, which has always annoyed the
pre-postmodern me) we cannot <u>prove</u> these beliefs to be false; and
the members of Heaven's Gate appear to have every right to believe these
things. There is no important difference between the irrationality of the
Native Americans and that of Heaven's Gate. In a society that promotes
the irrationalism of Christianity on such a massive scale, it is no wonder
that other bits of irrationality surface and grab the attention and allegiance
of those disaffected by institutionalized religion.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>My speaking of Christianity here might remind you that Bill Clinton
called the Rancho Sante Fe suicides "heartbreaking, sickening, and shocking,"
and he said that he would like to do something [lock up the internet?]
to prevent more of the same. But is Clinton's beloved Christianity so far
removed from the doctrines of Heaven's Gate? For the Christian, a better
life <u>is</u> coming, an
<u>eternal</u> life at that; we never really
die, thank God. And we get some sort of resurrected body. Christians of
old went to their foreseen and certain death in battles with religious
opponents, reassured by the thought that their Lord dispensed salvation
like gumballs. Shall we not, with Clinton, protect people from such belief
systems? <b>In the name of what, exactly?</b> A universal monism? A transindividual,
transcultural, transhistorical criterion of rationality?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Were the members of Heaven's Gate harmed? Were they coerced? Were they
carried away by inauthentic desires? Were they moved by lovely thoughts
of the meaning of Easter week? The surviving members who approved of the
suicides ("60 Minutes") refused to call the acts either harmful or suicides,
but admirable acts of courage. <u>Unlike</u> many Christians, the members
of Heaven's Gate took their religion seriously. It does <u>not</u> follow,
from the fact that these suicides were based on what seem to us to be irrational
beliefs, that these suicides constituted harm. What is rational is itself
a matter of "ultimate" belief systems. We cannot wield, against their notion
of "harm," the objection that their beliefs are "irrational" unless we
want to condemn all notions of harm, and much else besides.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4. I turn, now, to another set of cases, a prototype of which was recorded
in <u>Genesis</u> [29:20-25]:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a
few days to him because of his love for her. Then Jacob said to Laban,
"Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to lie with her." So
Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast. But
when evening came, he took ... Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob lay
with her.... When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban,
" ... I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?"
<br>&nbsp;
<p>But didn't Jacob thoroughly enjoy himself anyway, believing that it
was Rachel in his arms?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Similar things have happened more recently: a woman charged a man with
rape, because he snuck into her bed in the dark of night and she made love
with him, believing, through his silence, that he was her boyfriend instead
of their joint roommate. (Gee whiz, couldn't she recognize a difference
in odor, physique, or in the length, girth, or shape of the organ?)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>How are we to understand the harm this woman endured? On one view, she
was harmed in the act of sex itself, even if she enjoyed it, since she
never consented to having sex with a person she falsely believed was her
boyfriend. On the other hand, we might want to say that she was <u>not</u>
harmed as long as she didn't know that the interloper was not her boyfriend,
but harmed only afterwards, when she discovered the deception. That is,
she was harmed only because and when she experienced disgust and shame
and anger upon discovering what had happened to her (or what she had really
done). Of course, if the sex had been rotten, she would have been harmed
in another way. [Schulhofer] [Suppose the "stranger," after the woman has
reacted with horror to her discovery, takes off a mask to reveal that her
sexual partner had been, all along, her boyfriend. She had never been harmed
in any sense. And no wonder she didn't sniff a difference in odor.]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The point is this: a change in her experience, from sexual joy to nauseating
disgust upon discovering with whom she was really having sex, shows that
our beliefs, as well as our cultural ideas about the significance of sex,
play a large role in shaping why and whether we experience an activity
as <u>harm</u>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As social constructionists are fond of pointing out, we create social
things by using words. There really is no such item as masturbatory insanity
or nymphomania or sexual addiction or "intermittent explosive disorder"
(or perhaps even the battered-woman syndrome): there is no medical condition,
no psychological character trait, no underlying pathology. [See Alan Dershowitz,
<u>The Abuse Excuse</u>.] Well, there are such things, but <u>only</u>
because we have picked out some behaviors and made up a word for them,
not because masturbatory insanity and nymphomania have, like the moon,
an existence independent of our language, our observations, and our evaluations
of it. Social facts, such as the existence of "peasants," "witches," and
"yuppies," have an odd nature: their application presupposes an intricate
belief system. Similar considerations apply to "sexual perversion," "philanderer,"
and "homosexuality."
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>But, then, there is also no such <u>real</u> thing as the harms due
to penis-feeding--and maybe not rape, too. Let me explain.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>4A. What <u>is</u> the harm of rape--beyond being assaulted, or in addition
to the violence and the fear it produces? Why not punish rape merely as
an assault, e.g., a mugging? Why penalize it so
<u>heavily</u>? And why
think it is such a <u>horrible</u> thing to do or to have done to oneself?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The answer seems to be: we have certain beliefs about the sanctity of
our sexuality. Without these beliefs--without our considering the sexual
to be so central to our selves, our spirits; without our thinking that
somehow sexuality is unique in its significance and needs therefore special
protections; without [in the words of the legal philosopher Jeffrie Murphy]
the "complex symbolic and moral baggage" that surrounds sexuality in our
culture--we would not be so bothered by rape, neither as a society <u>nor
subjectively</u> as victim. It is, on such a view, our Victorian attitudes
toward sex that ultimately explain why, for us, rape is such a horrible
crime and that, furthermore, create or induce in the victim the subjective
pain. If she (and we) didn't think sex was such a big deal, she (and we)
would feel no more outrage or pain than were she assaulted or mugged--in
the same way that, for Native Australian males, penis-cutting does not
register as subjectively negative.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Another legal philosopher, Alan Wertheimer, has replied to Murphy that
"A woman's abhorrence of nonconsensual sex may be at least partially hard-wired."
With this rebuttal, Wertheimer proposes that harm can be understood objectively
through biology. But if a woman's psychological response to rape is hard-wired,
if we appeal to a notion of "nature" or "the natural" to ground a notion
of harm, we are returning to a mode of argument that contemporary progressives
of all colors have tried to avoid--except lately, with regard to homosexuality,
which suggests that appeals to nature are made, or nature is rejected as
a foundation, according to our political leanings.

into drinking didn't help her any], she decides not to take my "no" as
"no" and forces the item of food into my mouth. "No biggie," seems to be
the appropriate judgment. Yet this is, as in rape, the violation of a bodily
orifice. Why the sanctity of the vagina but not the sanctity of the mouth?--only
because <u>we</u> surround the vagina, but not the oral cavity, with "complex
symbolic and moral baggage." Of course, were I a vegetarian, or from Calcutta,
or an Orthodox Jew, and the item of food that was thrust down my throat
[deeply] were hamburger or bacon, the appropriate judgement might not be
"no biggie," which again shows that harm exists only in the presence of
certain culturally-formed beliefs. Still, should the person who forces
a piece of bacon into the mouth of an Orthodox Jew be punished more severely
than for other physical assaults? Don't we want to say to the outraged,
psychologically distressed Jewish victim of the food attack that his or
her beliefs about the filthiness of pig meat are irrational if not just
false? If so, why not tell the victim of rape that her subjective response
is an overreaction to an assault that is based on her (and our) irrational
beliefs about the sanctity of the sexual? [Murphy]

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5. I want to move, now, from "harm" to another constellation of concepts:
consent, coercion, autonomy, and authenticity. For in response to some
(but not all) of my examples it might be thought: it is not so much the
physical nature of the act, its purported harm, that is objectionable;
rather, the fault is that someone is being forced or coerced, without their
consent, to do something. But this does not avoid the difficulties I have
already mentioned.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5A. Herodotus (Book V of the <u>History</u>): In Thrace,
<br>&nbsp;
<p>each man has several wives; when [a man] dies, a great contest arises
among the wives, and violent disputes among their friends, on this point,
which of them was most loved by the husband. She who is adjudged to have
been so, and is so honoured, having been extolled both by men and women,
is slain on the tomb by her own nearest relative, and when slain is buried
with her husband; the [other wives] deem this a great misfortune [to themselves],
for this is the utmost disgrace to them.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Even the most extreme physical damage, death, is not harm, depending
on one's beliefs and the culture one lives in. The most-favored wife considered
it the greatest honor to be slain and buried with her husband; this end
to her life was part of her notion of the good life. But was her participation
in this ceremony voluntary, consensual, or authentic? I think <i>yes</i>;
let me elaborate.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The legal scholar Ruth Colker thinks that the sexuality expressed and
exhibited by adult women, which surely feels to them to be their own sexuality,
is not "authentic," not really their own. [The Cosmo girl who wants a spanking;
lesbian sadomasochism; even women's vanilla heterosexuality.] What women's
genuine sexuality is can be known only after women "peel away" all the
layers of the patriarchal "social influences" that "limit [their] freedom."
According to Colker's metaphysics of the person, authentic sexuality lies
<u>beneath</u> the construction of women's sexuality by culture, as something
that is culture-free.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In contrast, consider what John Stuart Mill had to say about freedom
of marriage, while discussing Mormon polygyny in Utah in the United States
(ca. 1850):
<br>&nbsp;
<p>No one has a deeper disapprobation tha[n] I have of this Mormon institution....
[I]t is a direct infraction of th[e] principle [of liberty], being a mere
rivetting of the chains of one-half of the community, and an emancipation
of the other from reciprocity of obligation towards them. Still ... this
religion is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it,
and who may be deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any form
of the marriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear,
it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which
[teach] women to think marriage the one thing needful.... (<u>On Liberty</u>)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Mill's point is that someone's autonomously choosing an act or making
a decision is fully compatible with the act chosen or decision made being
a fundamental piece of one's culture, something that the person has learned,
along with everyone else, only by being raised in that culture. That is,
Mill</b> <b>thinks that the social plays an <u>unavoidable</u> role in
the genesis of our genuine natures and so could not, by that fact alone,
undermine the autonomy of our choosings.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>[A person] whose desires and impulses are not his own has no character,
no more than a steam engine has a character.... A person whose desires
and impulses are his own--are the expression of his own nature, as it has
been developed and modified by his own culture--is said to have a character.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5B. I'll return to this point later. Now I want to discuss some recent
proposals concerning the concept of coercion, and to draw out two more
lessons. Consider, first, <b>Robin Morgan's</b> feminist definition of
rape:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Rape exists any time sexual intercourse occurs when it has not been
initiated by the woman, out of her own genuine affection and desire....
How many millions of times have women had sex "willingly" with men they
didn't want to have sex with? ... How many times have women wished just
to sleep instead or read or watch the Late Show? ... Most of the decently
married bedrooms across America are settings for nightly rape.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The woman who is nagged into engaging in sexual activity by her husband,
and does so when she would prefer not to, is worrying that if she says
"no" to him, he will abandon her--an abandonment she fears for economic,
social, and psychological reasons. Women will be free to leave men, and
to refuse them sex if they want to, only when they are the economic and
social equals of men.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Further, women's sexuality, even their felt desires to engage in sexual
activity with their lovers or husbands, may not be, as Colker suggested,
"their own," but the result of oppressive social influences. Rape, according
to Morgan, can be avoided in heterosexual relations only when the sexual
activity is "initiated by the woman, out of her own ... desire." But given
the culture of male dominance in which heterosexual activity occurs, when
would it ever be the case that a woman knows what "her own" desires are,
let alone having her own desires? This would be true even if a woman has
a well-paying job and economic security: her sexual "liberation" in a sexist
society, the freedom to behave sexually as if she were a man, is a sham.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Catharine MacKinnon</b> goes beyond Morgan in her economic concept
of coercion; it is not just fear of economic abandonment or poverty that
causes and coerces women to participate in the making of pornography; it
is the <u>lure</u>, an offer, of damn good money, more money than they
would get working in an office or in Burger King.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The ... fact that prostitution and modeling are ... women's best economic
options should give pause to those who would consider women's presence
there a true act of free choice.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As the philosopher Carole Pateman makes the point, "economic <u>coercion</u>
is involved [in the making of pornography] since the sex industry pays
better wages than most occupations open to women."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The social psychologist <b>Charlene Muehlenhard</b> also holds an extreme
view of coercion. In her list of ways "women are coerced into having unwanted
sexual intercourse" that are "more subtle" than being violently raped,
she includes "compulsory heterosexuality"* and "discrimination against
lesbians" (which compel women into sexual relationships with men), "status
coercion" (women are coerced into sex or marriage by a man's fame or occupation),
and verbal pressure (the husband who badgers his wife for sex). Similarly,
Mary Koss's category "sexually coercive men" includes those who obtain
sex by false avowals of love.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>*Adrienne Rich claims that heterosexuality is a "man-made institution"
that is "forcibly and subliminally imposed on women" and "designed to keep
[them] within a male sexual purlieu."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(4) The assumption here [Morgan, MacKinnon, Muehlenhard] is that "coerced"
entails "morally wrong." But that's too simple. Consider, by contrast,
this bit of apparent good sense from Jeffrie Murphy:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>[I]t is sometimes permissible ... to obtain sex by the use of threats
and offers. "Have sex with me or I will find another girlfriend" strikes
me ... as a morally permissible threat, and "Have sex with me and I will
marry you" strikes me ... as a morally permissible offer. [Or: if you want
sex with me, you must marry me.] We negotiate our way through most of life
with schemes of threats and offers.... I see no reason why the realm of
sexuality should be utterly insulated from this normal way of being human.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Hence we can see that the judgments we reach in the presence or absence
of coercion are value-laden: coercion is neither necessary nor sufficient
for an act to be wrong, hence consent- and coercion-judgments need to be
supplemented with other moral assertions to derive moral conclusions [Alan
Wertheimer]. <b>What we need, in particular, is [what is bound to be a
contentious] account of <u>fair</u> vs. <u>unfair</u> coercion.</b> Offering
damn good money to a woman to make pornography might not be unfairly coercive,
if it is coercive at all.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>5C. There is something else to be learned from these attempts to expand
the concept of coercion. Consider these two examples: prisoners taking
part in medical experiments; and faculty and students engaging in sex-love
relationships.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>A change has occurred in our thinking, from "consent is possible in
these cases" <i>to</i> "no genuine consent is possible." It used to be
widely thought that prisoners could be asked to participate in medical
experiments--doing so allows them to make a contribution to the society
they have wronged, and they help us learn more about cures and treatments.
No one held a gun to their heads. Similarly, it used to be widely thought
that a male professor could engage in a sex-love relationship with a female
student; in a time of the denial of the university's <i>in loco parentis</i>
role, it was assumed that female students, graduate or undergraduate, could
participate in such an arrangement without being coerced. Now, regarding
both examples, many think differently: the prisoners constitute a captive
population vulnerable to subtle pressures of all kinds, so their ability
to give genuine consent to being guinea pigs is doubtful; female students
awed and overwhelmed by the wisdom and status of male professors are really
just naive little girls being preyed upon by scheming lechers whose only
duty is to discipline the mind but not [to investigate] the body. But,
in both examples, the underlying <u>facts</u> of the cases are exactly
the same; what we have done is to decide to interpret or evaluate them
differently: from <i>noncoercive or not fairly coercive</i> to
<i>coercive
or unfairly coercive</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>How can this conceptual fluidity, this change in our evaluations and
interpretations, be explained? What might justify our going along with
Morgan's and MacKinnon's and Muehlenhard's proposals about expanding the
concept of coercion? There are three explanations that I can see:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(1) First, we could say that our eyes are finally open to an objective
moral truth about these situations that had always been there, but was
as yet undiscovered (like Cuba had to be discovered, for Europeans, by
Columbus); as a result of our improved moral perceptions, we have made
real moral progress.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(2) Alternatively, we have morally regressed; we have become blind to
a moral truth that we had earlier seen quite clearly. Some people get better
at making accurate moral judgments; our ability to do so has degenerated.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(3) A third view has been expressed by Jeffrey Weeks. As we have seen,
his moral position (<u>Invented Moralities</u>) is a pluralism that values
individual freedom, autonomy, and choice, a humanism that "celebrates the
rich diversity of human goals" and the "authenticity" of personal choices.
But what do "autonomy" and "authentic" choice mean, exactly? Weeks realizes
the problem, and provides this answer: "Values are human inventions ...
[they] depend on us, what we want or desire." [Hume?] Because values are
human inventions, we <u>make</u> (that is, create, as if we were God) the
meanings of consent and authenticity. "Their meaning needs to be struggled
for...." They must be "fought for and constructed," he says. All we are
entitled to say is that one social force, or one set of cultural beliefs,
has merely been replaced by or conquered by another, and this change in
our belief system has been orchestrated by power: might makes right. Those
who believed in the old conceptual scheme have retired or died off, or
have otherwise been replaced in positions of power by those who embrace
and disseminate, i.e., teach, the new conceptual scheme. The new beliefs
have succeeded as a result of political and social factors. [Kuhnian philosophy
of science.] The only difference between our formerly finding no coercion,
and nowadays finding unfair coercion, in the prisoner and sex cases is
that we have created different values, constructed different conceptions
of coercion, to accommodate our newly-emerging form of life. It is as if
we could change our attitudes toward paedophilia and become more like the
Sambia and Etoro. [Weeks's conclusion, in effect.] But what, exactly, we
<u>should</u> struggle for, is a question about which Weeks must, and does,
remain as silent as the Leah who snuck into bed with Jacob.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The funny thing is that those who wield this power and take advantage
of conceptual fluidity to effect their goals and vision believe (which
is not true, or at least not rational) that they are merely following the
dictates of a genuine moral truth. The foundation of our practices is thoroughly
self-deceptive.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6. Finale: Clitoridectomy.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6A. Many people in our society are outraged by the practice, in Native
African cultures, of infibulation and other kinds of "genital cutting."
But in terms of the cultures that practice it, infibulation is "a gift
that [a woman] give[s] under pain of sanction, for which [she] receive[s]
a greater gift in return." "The logic of [genital cutting] is that by taking
a tiny bit of the sacred instrument of fertility as an offering, the god
of fertility will bless you with more children and easier childbirth."
[Emmanuel Babatunde (<u>Phila. Inquirer</u>)]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Recall that Native Australian penis-cutting has the same rationale.
Is this diversity or disorder? Why would we want to ask and answer this
question? Why would we want to impose our notions of harm and rationality
on them? In the name of what?
<br>&nbsp;
<p>As Mill said in <u>On Liberty</u> about Mormon polygyny: "A recent writer
... proposes ... not a crusade, but a <i>civilizade</i>, against this polygamous
community, to put an end to what seems to him a retrograde step in civilization.
It also appears so to me, but I am not aware that any community has a right
to force another to be civilized." And surely not a society as uncivilized
as ours, which has its own panoply [panoplee] of painful and mutilating
practices: tattoos; putting loops of metal through our nostrils and eyebrows,
so that the rings hang as if they were desiccated and petrified columns
of snot; inserting metal rings through the nipples, labia, penis, or scrotum,
as in some sadomasochistic routines; surgery to excise excess fat from
the abdomen and thighs; the injection of collagen into the lips to make
them more puffy; and breast implants. These practices do not even have
the high religious or social justification of contributing to fertility,
but are in large measure frivolous. [David Marcus (<u>Times-Picayune</u>).]
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Let me apply Mill's earlier point to the case of infibulation. An
African mother's agreeing to having genital cutting done to her female
child--even actively cooperating because she holds these beliefs about
infibulation and fertility--this participation is <u>not necessarily</u>
inauthentic or coerced merely because the mother has been raised in a culture
that gave her these beliefs. If being raised in that culture, and being
taught those beliefs, undermines the authenticity of the mother's participation,
then in our culture, where we are taught that these practices are <u>not</u>
to be done, our reluctance to engage in them has been similarly culturally
manufactured and is therefore not authentic.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>6B. Waris Dirie, a woman born in Somalia, has said about the results
of genital cutting that "It's like being crippled." But, of course, in
Somalia it is <u>not</u> being crippled at all, no more so than the deaths
of the members of Heaven's gate were suicides.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When Waris moved from Somalia to England--she ran away from home rather
than endure an arranged marriage (by the way, she was blessed: her uncle
was the Somalian ambassador to Britain), "she discovered that her cousins
[who were raised in England] weren't circumcised. 'I figured out [she said]
that what happened to me wasn't right.'"
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This is not quite correct. Living in England, Waris came to "embrace[...]
Western culture," learning English and British habits from TV. She merely
replaced one set of cultural beliefs and judgments with another set. Irony
of all ironies, Waris eventually chose a modeling career--in keeping with
the Western culture that she had embraced--parading her half-nude body
for advertisements and in fashion shows. [Lisa Hamm (<u>Times-Picayune</u>)]
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Let me end with a question for you: I'd like to know which of two possible
covers for a book of mine that is coming out at the end of the summer is
disorder, and which one is diversity.
