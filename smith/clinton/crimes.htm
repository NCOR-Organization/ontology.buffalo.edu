    &nbsp;&nbsp; I was at home, desultorily chewing on my dinner, when CNN's Wolf Blitzer
    broke in a report that the White House had released a 73-page pre-emptive strike against
    the now infamous Starr Report.&nbsp; In it, Blitzer had said, that Clinton Lawyer, David
    E. Kendall, had purported that: </p>
    <p><em><strong>&quot;The President has acknowledged a serious mistake - an inappropriate
    relationship with Monica Lewinsky.&quot; </strong></em></p>
    <p>My reaction was rather evisceral -- I spit a brussel sprout across the length of my
    dinning room.&nbsp; A mistake?&nbsp; Possible federal crimes by the President of the US
    are no more than serious mistakes?&nbsp; As if the statement was not surreal enough, the
    rebuttal also insisted that &quot;the law defines perjury very clearly. Perjury requires
    proof that an individual knowingly made a false statement while under oath.&quot; </p>
    <p>I was at a loss -- and it wasn't just the taste of a brussel sprout I never got to
    know.&nbsp; In the space of a few minutes, it became abundantly clear that we have a
    madman running the United States of America.&nbsp; That became clearer as I later waded
    through well over 100 pages of the most X-rated report ever to emanate from a government
    agency.&nbsp; The X-files meets Tracy Lords. </p>
    <p>Even before the Starr report was released, it was undeniable that Mr. Clinton had -- at
    the very least -- lied in both his civil deposition and before the August 17th federal
    grand jury.&nbsp; But still, even after all that has transpired, they cannot admit that. </p>
    <p>From the Starr Report: </p>
    <p>In his <u>Jones</u> deposition on January 17, 1998, President Clinton -- who said he
    was unable to recall most of his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky ... testifying before the
    grand jury on August 17, 1998,&nbsp; said that his first &quot;real conversation&quot;
    with Ms. Lewinsky occurred during the November 1995 furlough.&nbsp; He testified: &nbsp;
    &quot;one night she brought me some pizza.&nbsp; We had some remarks.&quot; </p>
    <p>Some remarks .... </p>
    <p>Did those remarks come before she rode his bologna pony, or afterwards?&nbsp; How can
    Mr. Kendall, with a straight face, say that Mr. Clinton did not knowingly lie about his
    relations with Miss. Lewinsky?&nbsp; Forget the sex -- what constitutes it and what
    doesn't. Ask any wife in the universe and they'll tell you what extramarital sex entails.
    &nbsp; Personally, I can't stare at a cake mix box too long without risking being accused
    of carrying on an illicit affair with Betty Crocker. </p>
    <p>Read the Starr Report long enough, and one sees that Mr. Clinton had more to do with
    Monica than &quot;remarks&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a long, tawdry tale of fellatio and
    masturbation (my spell-checker is killing me). While it may be true that masturbation, as
    Woody Allen once said, is sex with someone you love, the Starr Report makes it abundantly
    clear that Mr. Clinton did not engage himself alone. He had Monica there to help out with
    the small details. </p>
    <p><em><strong>&quot;Perjury requires proof that an individual knowingly made a false
    statement while under oath.&quot;</strong></em> </p>
    <p>Bingo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Clinton not only once, but several times perjured himself -- not
    only when danced around with what constitutes sex, but also on his recollection of the
    relationship itself.&nbsp; The man could not remember gifts he gave, could barely recall
    who Monica was, yet just weeks before the story broke -- we now know -- he met with
    Lewinsky in the White House when it became clear she was going to be deposed in the Paula
    Jones case. </p>
    <p>Of course, we've also been told that perjury is no big deal and, at the very least, a
    president should not be forced from office for little white lies.&nbsp; But consider some
    of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for crimes which are graded in severity on a scale of
    1 to 43 (1-mild 43-severe). </p>
    <p>Trespassing 4<br>
    Environmental Pollution 6<br>
    Tax Fraud 6<br>
    Minor assault 6<br>
    Bribery 10<br>
    Smuggling illegals 12<br>
    Burglary 12<br>
    Illegal weapons export 14<br>
    Statutory rape 15<br>
    <strong>Perjury 15<br>
    Obstruction of Justice 15<br>
    Subornation of Perjury 15</strong><br>
    Aggravated assault 16<br>
    Armed Robbery 20<br>
    Money Laundering 20<br>
    Kidnapping 24<br>
    First Degree Murder 43</p>
    <p>In effect, the Clinton airbags wants us to believe that perjury in a civil case is not
    even worth our consideration.&nbsp; What if Mr. Clinton had raped Miss Lewinsky? &nbsp;
    What if he'd ordered a break-in of her apartment to retrieve gifts?&nbsp; What if he had
    bribed her to remain silent?&nbsp; All of these offenses, under US federal guidelines,
    would have been less or as serious than that which he is known to have already committed! </p>
    <p>In the space of a few weeks, since August 17th, people with an IQ higher than Monica's
    waist measurement know that the president's elevator has ceased traveling to the top
    floor.&nbsp; On the day of the Starr Report, Mr. Clinton pulled a Jimmy Swaggart and
    tearfully told members of a prayer breakfast that he had sinned, that he was contrite, and
    that he had to somehow atone for what he had done to his family and the nation.&nbsp; As
    he gushed fake tears and contrition all over the gathering, Mr. Kendall was releasing a
    rebuttal, slamming Starr for trying to &quot;humiliate&quot; the president. </p>
    <p>Mr. Kendall, I dare say that the president humiliated himself a long time ago. &nbsp;
    Mr. Clinton is the guy laughing, not realizing that the joke's on him.&nbsp; But, of
    course, this particular joke is now on all of us.&nbsp; The United States has become the
    laughing stock of the world. </p>
    <p>Said Park Min-ja, a 55-year-old housewife in Seoul:&nbsp; &quot;what an embarrassment!
    &nbsp; The Americans should have handled this more quietly.&nbsp; How is he going to stand
    before children?&quot; </p>
    <p>Mexico's Televisa television network called the report &quot;500 pages of shameful
    details&quot; and asked &quot;what has become of the pride, the dignity of the most
    powerful nation on earth?&quot; </p>
    <p>The Sun, a British tabloid, announced in an editorial that Clinton was &quot;unfit to
    be president&quot; and &quot;he must go.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Express tabloid in Britain printed an article about Hillary Rodham Clinton under
    the headline:&nbsp; &quot;I'm with you all the way ... you vile creep.&quot; </p>
    <p>Anyone who assumed that the Starr Report would force the madman in the White House to
    resign, should quickly think again. Kendall and his slimly toads have yet more legal rocks
    under which to crawl.&nbsp; Clinton will continue to apologize and whine at every function
    from now until Christmas.&nbsp; And Hillary will, as she did at the Irish-American
    gathering on the 11th of August, beam up at her husband with false pride, while hiding her
    snarls and humiliation within. </p>
    <p>But lost in the public discourse of the Starr Report is this little tidbit, which
    refers to the status of the less-ballyhooed White Water, Travelgate, Filegate and travel
    office fiascoes: </p>
    <p><em><strong>All phases of the investigation are now nearing completion. This Office
    will soon make final decisions about what steps to take, if any, with respect to the other
    information it has gathered. Those decisions will be made at the earliest practical time,
    consistent with our statutory and ethical obligations. </strong></em></p>
    <p>Mr. Starr is, of course, referring to possible indictments.&nbsp; So, Mr. Kendall can
    pan the Starr Report all he wants.&nbsp; Indeed, the report is a tragic commentary on how
    far this country has fallen into a great moral morass.&nbsp; But the Starr Report is more
    than tragic. </p>
    <p>It is also just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
