                                  Americans have been asking how the House of Representatives
                                  thinks it can get away with impeaching President Clinton when
                                  public opinion strongly opposes it. 

<p>                            "Why are they not listening to the people of the United States?" one
                            caller wanted to know. 

<p>                            It's because they don't have to. 

<p>                            <b>Congress doesn't represent the people. It doesn't even represent
                            districts. It represents the dominant factions in its districts, and the rest
                            be damned.</b>

<p>                            Single-member districting is the root of this problem. Gerrymandering
                            and unlimited campaign spending, a monstrous advantage for
                            incumbents, have made it worse. 

<p>                            Tens of millions of Americans have no chance to ever be represented
                            by the people of their choice. Millions more have been
                            overconcentrated, under the guise of upholding "voting rights," into
                            electoral ghettoes where they are sure to elect African-Americans or
                            Hispanics like them, but where they are invisible and irrelevant to the
                            lawmakers who represent the "bleached" constituencies next door. 

<p>                            On Nov. 3, the Republicans won 51 percent of the seats in the House
                            with only 48.8 percent of the votes actually cast in contested races.
                            The Democrats won 48.5 percent of the House with 49 percent of the
                            vote. Libertarians, the Reform Party and others wound up with the
                            grand total of one seat -- independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont --
                            despite having polled 2-million votes, the equivalent of 10 congressional
                            districts, nationwide. 

<p>                            The Democrats might have won control of the House if they hadn't
                            decisively lost the battle of uncontested seats, 29 to 18. 

<p>                            Where the Republicans own most of their seats is significant. Not
                            where pro-Clinton opinion is strongest, but in the South and the
                            mountain West, where moderate Republicans are as unwelcome as the
                            IRS and where the Republican right, a faction within a faction, controls
                            the primaries. 

<p>                            The reverse is often true in Democratic states, creating a Congress
                            whose members are more extreme, more polarized and more hostile to
                            compromise than the nation they represent. The House Judiciary
                            Committee is a pungent example. 

<p>                            An analysis by Ronald Brownstein of the Los Angeles Times pointed
                            up last week how the Southern wing was driving Clinton's
                            impeachment. While some moderates from pro-Clinton regions
                            privately preferred censure, he wrote, "they lack the numbers and
                            influence to force the party's dominant conservative wing to provide
                            that option." Yet if there is a voter backlash, he noted, it will be the
                            moderates who don't return in 2001. 

<p>                            It would be poetic justice if that cost the GOP its House majority, but it
                            would be bad for the country. 

<p>                            George Washington's famous farewell echoes true: "Let me now . . .
                            warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the
                            spirit of party." 

<p>                            The Constitution doesn't mention parties. It doesn't mention
                            single-member districts either, although federal law now requires them.
                            The law should be changed to permit the states to experiment with
                            proportional representation in Congress. 

<p>                            Single-member districting was better than at-large systems where the
                            dominant party took all seats at once. But without proportional voting, it
                            can still take them all piecemeal. Winner-take-all is for sports, not
                            self-government. 

<p>                            Quebec's recent election offers fair warning. The secessionist Parti
                            Quebecois won 60 percent of the seats in the provincial legislature
                            despite polling fewer votes than the Liberals. Its single-member
                            districts could not have been redrawn to prevent that because of the
                            heavy concentration of Liberal voters at Montreal. 

<p>                            The United States has its own extreme examples. Democratic
                            candidates got one third of Oklahoma's congressional votes but none of
                            its six seats because Democratic voters were dispersed throughout the
                            state. In Texas, on the other hand, the Republicans won only 13 of the
                            29 seats though they had 51.5 percent of the votes. But among those
                            19 were <b>three of the leaders of the Clinton lynch mob: Bill Archer,
                            Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, whose districts are so stacked in their
                            favor that only DeLay had a Democratic opponent. They can afford to
                            thumb their noses at public opinion elsewhere.</b> 

<p>                            As usual, most races nationwide were over before they began. The
                            Center for Voting and Democracy, which promotes proportional
                            representation, accurately predicted 358 of 361 winners more than a
                            year before the 1998 election. The average victory margin was the
                            highest this decade: a 43-point spread. Only 43 seats -- out of 435 --
                            were won with less than a 10-point spread. 

<p>                            Some 10.1-million Democrats voted for losers, as against only
                            8.5-million Republicans; both groups have no one speaking for them in
                            Congress. That doesn't count 47 districts where incumbents were
                            effectively unopposed. Florida was the nation's sorriest undemocratic
                            example in that regard; 15 of our 23 incumbents weren't even on the
                            ballot, and a 16th had only a feeble write-in opponent. That was more
                            than a third of all the uncontested seats nationwide. 

<p>                            The great mass of Floridians lost their right to vote because of the way
                            the Legislature and the courts drew the lines -- first to favor
                            incumbents and later to create "safe" minority seats with safe
                            Republican seats as the other part of the bargain. 

<p>                            <b>This is what Lani Guinier, an advocate of proportional voting, decried
                            as the "triumph of tokenism." Having nominated her to head the Civil
                            Rights Division, Clinton abandoned her in the face of false charges that
                            she was a "quota queen." </b>

 Florida is now all Republican.  They will draw the map next time, which should cost the Democrats a ton of seats in Congress and the State legislature.  Liberal rag St. Petersburg Times, which never lifted a finger when Republicans were being gerrymandered, is now trying to save the Democrats by advocating proportional representation.  Proportional representation is one reason why the Israeli government is always unstable---any fringe group can get a seat in parliament and tie up the entire government.  Right npow we have 30 "moderate" Republicans who are calling the whole tune in Congress.  Imagine this situation multiplied over and over again---that's proportional representation.

 <i>This article is exactly why I won't pay to receive it

The Houston Chroncle is the same....it was a decent paper until the LIBERAL Houston paper went under and all the LIBERAL journalists fled to the one remaining paper, The Chronicle, and took it over.  We canceled it over a year ago...but I peak at it too.  It is good to check out the opposition...and a relief not to have to. <p>Regards, Cincinatus' wife   <br>

I find this paragraph to be an unbelievable mixture of self political interest - somehow no one noticed the problems of electoral ghettoes before 1994. Than we are told that people 'like us' are only those with which we share some racial affinities. Than it all ends with a full-blown racist slur, talking about "bleached" constituencies.<p>
I propose that the author be outed as an unspoken racist of the imbecilic variety (that a race in itself) and be shamed into resigning his jobs and whatever insignificant public functions he might have performed - something on the line of that sport commentator who said that blacks can't swim well because their bones are heavier.<p>
I believe that calling white people 'bleached' is at least as outrageous (not that I care) as one Reaganite cabinet member remark some years ago who demonstrated the diversity of his staff by noting that he had "a black, a jew and a cripple". This is exactly what today's extreme leftists mean by diversity (with a positive connotation attached to the term) without ever spelling out what it means in their view.<p>

 Israel is the ultimate example of proportional representation.  The entire country is one electoral district and seats are divided up simply along the percentage of votes garnered by each party.<P>This article ties the current electoral system with whining about Clinton's well-deserved impeachment.  We should look at the electoral system without viewing a single political issue.<P>  There are other ways than total proportional voting to open up the system.  For example, have multiple member districts, say combine 5 congressional districts into one, and each voter then gets 5 votes.<P>In the past election, I believe 80+ seats were uncontested, that almost 20% of the seats.  Election consultants say that in a typical year, only 5% of congressional elections are in play.  This is unacceptable.  They're supposed to represent the people and they don't.<br>

This is exactly what you would do if you wanted to divide the nation accross racist 'multi-cultural' and even gender lines. With such representation the black constituents would tend and be probably encouraged to contact their black representative, women would probably seek their 'congresswoman' and so forth. And you will still see disenfranchised. I can assume that not all congressional super-districts would have elected a mentally-retarded trans-sexual muslim woman to represent like constituents.<br>

 "On Nov. 3, the Republicans won 51 percent of the seats in the House
with only 48.8 percent of the votes actually cast in contested races. The
Democrats won 48.5 percent of the House with 49 percent of the vote.
Libertarians, the Reform Party and others wound up with the grand total
of one seat -- independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- despite having
polled 2-million votes, the equivalent of 10 congressional districts,
nationwide."<p>

  We should note that Dyckman makes no mention of the actual vote totals of Democrats and Republicans, using only percentages.    Then in giving the results of the minor parties he uses actual numbers and omits the mention of their percentages--barely TWO per cent.   <p> Anytime a "researcher" switches from PERCENTAGES to ACTUAL NUMBER one can be fairly certain that the "researcher" is, in truth, an ADVOCATE.    And that which Dyckman advocates, proportional representation, is a highway to political instability.<br>
