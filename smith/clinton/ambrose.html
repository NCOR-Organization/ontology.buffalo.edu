<blockquote><A href="mailto:etletters@telegraph.co.uk">E-mail Electronic Telegraph</a></blockquote><p><p>
THIS page is designed to give readers easy access to ET's archive of material written by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the Sunday Telegraph's ex-Washington correspondent, from 1994 - 97.<p> <p>
His articles on the Clinton administration have created enormous interest in Britain and the US and have been widely quoted on the Internet.<p>
 Last year, Mr Evans-Pritchard's notoriety with the White House reached a peak when he  was accused of delving into the murky realms of conspiracy theorism. In a 331-page report, its legal office attacked journalists whose unflinching focus on scandal was wrecking President Clinton's reputation. <p>
According to the report, <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/97/1/8/wclin08.html">"right-wing" think tanks and British newspapers fed "conspiracy theories and innuendo" to scandal-hungry UK journalists in America</a>. The resulting articles were then picked up on by US mainstream press, and fed to the public as "real" stories. <p><p>
Mr Evans-Pritchard was singled out as a trouble maker who was part of a well-organised "media food chain" of events. His response was swift. He responded to the "shameless propaganda", which accused him of working for a London "tabloid", with: <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/97/1/12/wamb12.html">Why is Clinton persecuting me? </a>written on Jan 12 1997.<p><p>
He wrote: "Once again, it seems that the White House is willing deliberately to propagate outright lies. . . <p>
"They have been caught using the office of the presidency to run a smear campaign against journalists and political opponents, turning the White House into an adjunct of the Democratic National Committee.<p><p>
"Even Richard Nixon, at the height of Watergate, was cautious not to venture so far out into these perilous waters."<p><p>
But the White House was not the first to publicly question Mr Evans-Pritchard's journalistic credibility. In 1995, the Washington Post, in a front page article on the "Foster conspiracy theorists", attacked the Sunday Telegraph and its outspoken correspondent. <p>
In response, he turned the tables on the US newspaper with the article: <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/95/7/10/wfost110.html">America's top newspaper has pointed the finger at our man in Washington. Now it's his turn</a>, written on July 10.<p><p>
Candid as ever, he wrote: "My straitjacket is buckled tight. The foam is wiped off my mouth. A bottle of sedatives sits at hand. I am cool, calm and ready to answer on behalf of all "conspiracy theorists". And I say to the powers of the Washington Post: 'J'accuse.'"<p><p>
It is not just the political manoeuvrings of Bill Clinton that have been subjected to Mr Evans-Pritchard's steely gaze, however. He has also <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/96/9/22/wclin22.html">written on the alleged drug use of the president</a>, America's <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/97/3/2/wabor02.html">partial birth abortion industry</a>, which he describes as "essentially infanticide", and on the controversial issue of "<A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/96/12/1/wus01.html">child abuse witch-hunts"</a>. These are to name but a few.<p><p>
On his departure from his position as Washington correspondent in April 1997, the White House breathed a collective sigh of relief. It was quoted as saying in George magazine: "That's another British invasion we're glad is over. The guy was nothing but a pain in the ass". <p><p>
But with this statement barely hot off the press, Mr Evans-Pritchard took up the gauntlet with the article: <A href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000153675629455&rtmo=f3ar3Yls&atmo=ggggggVK&pg=/et/97/4/20/wbye20.html">Goodbye, good riddance</a> on April 20 1997: "Critics tell me that I have invested too much emotion in my quarrel with the Clintons. To that I plead guilty. It comes from befriending so many of their victims. <p><p>
"I am content to be blacklisted as the "mad scribbler" - as the Washington Post called me this week - for I am confident that one day historians are going to view Clinton as a the last great cad of the 20th century, or worse."<p> <p>
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard continues to comment on the Clinton saga, as our wealth of links will testify.<p>
