<br><b><font size=+1>Let's Knock The Presidency Down a Notch</font></b>
<p><b>The Orange County Register</b>
<br><b>December 22, 1998</b> <i>Alan W. Bock, Senior Editorial Writer</i>
<p><font size=+0>The most constructive thing that could come from an extended
national discussion surrounding impeachment and a Senate trial of the president
would be a serious reconsideration of the role of the presidency in our
national life. The emotional nature of some of the opposition to impeachment
(as well as some of those plumping to kick out the scoundrel currently
inhabiting the Oval Office) suggested that too many Americans have simply
invested too much of themselves not just in the character of this president
but in the presidency as an institution.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The over-the-top rantings of liberal celebrities
like Alan Dershowitz and Alec Baldwin (who "humorously" spoke on a comedy
program of stoning Henry Hyde to death, and his family, too, for the mortal
sin of continuing impeachment proceedings) have received some attention.
But a similarly outsized case of presidency worship is on display in the
Dec. 14 issue of the neo-conservative magazine The Weekly Standard, which
wanted impeachment so badly its editors could taste it. "The presidency
is the sun around which our day-to-day public life and discourse revolve,"
said an editorial arguing that Clinton has dishonored the apparently sacred
institution.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Plenty of person-on-the-street interviews feature
somewhat less overheated comments to the effect that President Clinton
may have lied about sex and done other reprehensible things, but l'Affaire
Lewinsky doesn't seem to have affected his ability to "run the country,"
so why are folks excited. The economy's good, so the president must be
"managing" it pretty well.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The idea that the president actually "runs the country"
and would somehow be distracted from that job, leading all of us to suffer
should he removed from office, seems to have taken firm root in popular
folklore. It's a thoroughly untrue and thoroughly unhealthy sentiment in
a free society, more suited to an absolutist monarchy than to a free republic
or even a democracy.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Rulers certainly influence how the inhabitants of
a country go about their daily routines and can become the determining
factor in most people's lives when there's a war or other all-consuming
political crisis. But a country is run by those who go to work, do their
jobs, create goods, services and profits, create homes for their families
and support networks for their loved ones, independently of what a president
does -- independently, even, of whether there is a president at all.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The U.S. Constitution didn't anticipate that the
president would "run" the country or manage the economy. It does say he
shall be commander in chief of the military and shall have the power to
grant pardons and reprieves. He is empowered to make treaties (with the
advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate) and appoint ambassadors
and judges of the Supreme Court. His duties specifically include reporting
to Congress on the state of the union, recommending legislation, convening
both houses "on extraordinary occasions," receiving ambassadors and "tak[ing]
care that the laws be faithfully executed."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;All of that makes the president, as those who wrote
the constitution understood, a reasonably powerful executive official.
But his duties are strictly governmental in nature, and the government
over which he presides was -- at least as the Constitution was written
-- rather strictly limited to certain enumerated powers, like laying and
collecting taxes, regulating commerce with foreign nations and among the
states, coining money, establishing a post office and patent office, raising
and supporting armies and the like. The 9th and 10th Amendments tried to
make things even clearer, stating that all rights not given to the national
government were reserved to the states and the people.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;None of the founders imagined that the president
(or Congress) would or should run the country or manage the economy. Not
only did they know it would be physically impossible, they feared giving
government that kind of power. They had spent lives and fortunes freeing
themselves from what they viewed as the intolerable tyranny of a distant
monarch. They had no interest in creating a new one.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;My, how things have changed.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The building of the presidency into a royalist or imperial
institution has been going on for a long time -- at least for the better
part of this century and arguably longer. The outcome, fitfully (and often
opportunistically) decried by conservatives and liberals alike at various
times, is a presidency more like a godhead, viewed as the First Father,
the First Teacher, the center of our national life, the "sun," the manager
and fixer of the economy, the essential leader without whom our life as
a people would be empty and meaningless.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;One of the most over-the-top expressions of presidency
worship came from retired New York Episcopal Bishop Paul Moore at a save-the-president
rally in New York last week. "I think of the millions of people who will
suffer and die because the Republicans want to get President Clinton for
a personal sin," said the apparently daft ecclesiastic a couple of days
before the renowned peacemaker launched missiles.</font>
<p><font size=+0>However, while a case can be made that it is important
to have a strong presidency during times of war and maybe even, reluctantly,
during times of extended "cold war," the country is better off with a weaker,
less influential, less all-commanding presidency during times of peace.
And any country that aspires to keep its freedom should hope to be at peace
most of the time. It's time to think seriously about taking not just this
president but the presidency as an institution down several pegs.</font>
