<p><b><font size=+1>Standing Up for the Truth</font></b>
<p><b>US News and World report</b>
<br><b>November 30 Edition</b> <i>David Gergen</i>
<p><font size=+0>BY DAVID GERGEN / EDITOR AT LARGE Standing up for the
truth Clinton's offenses may not be impeachable, but they are unacceptable</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The central question hanging over American public
life today is whether, in our exhaustion, we will slink away from evidence
pointing toward perjury and obstruction of justice by the highest officer
in the land. For the sake of our children, not to mention the rule of law,
we cannot and should not.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Kenneth Starr laid before the House Judiciary Committee
a compelling case that at six critical forks in the road, President Clinton
knowingly chose the wrong path, lying in court and encouraging others to
lie in his behalf. Starr carefully avoided saying that he had an airtight
case; "the evidence suggests . . ." he said repeatedly. But if the charges
are true–and even many Democrats think they are–they represent a scathing
indictment of presidential behavior.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Whether they are impeachable or not is a close call.
While a minority vigorously disagrees, most legal scholars believe they
do not rise to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors" as envisioned
by the framers. Indeed, they are nowhere near as egregious as the abuses
of official power by Richard Nixon, nor are they heinous acts of private
conduct that one might expect for eviction from the White House.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;A matter of trust. In such a close case, it is also
right and proper that Congress pay heed to public sentiment. Through the
ballot box and polls, Americans have sent abundant signals that they believe
Clinton has otherwise been a good steward and should remain in office.
Overwhelming majorities oppose impeachment. In the elections of 1936, the
public sent a similarly clear signal, in that case that it was sick of
having the Supreme Court overturn New Deal legislation. Afterward, the
court magically reversed direction, recalling the remark by Mr. Dooley,
the fictional Irish philosopher, "Th' Supreme Coort follows th' iliction
returns." What was good for the court then is fine for Congress now.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Yet, for the House to turn down impeachment, based
on current evidence, does not mean Congress should wash its hands of the
matter, as a growing number of Republicans and Democrats are now asserting.
GOP Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania argues, for example, that Congress
should leave the matter to Starr to bring criminal charges against the
president when he becomes a private citizen; as a practical matter, it's
doubtful such charges will ever be filed.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;At the end of the day, we should recognize that
the heart of this case is not about Clinton, nor is it about Starr. It
is about us, the citizenry: What standards do we demand from our elected
representatives, and do we apply them equally, even to a popular president?</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;His defenders would have us believe that lying under
oath, especially about sex, is a trivial violation of the law. Not so.
The New York Times reviewed over 100 cases of perjury in state and federal
courts and found that scores of people have been sent to jail or otherwise
punished for lies under oath.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;This episode challenges our political standards,
too. After scandals of the past, as in Watergate and Iran-contra, politicians
concluded that the one thing worse than a crime is a coverup. The lesson:
"If caught, come clean." Should the president now go scot-free, we will
teach the next generation very different, more cynical rules: "If you're
questioned, deny; if pressed, attack; if caught, lie. And if you just string
it out long enough, the public will grow bored and walk away from the scandal."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Journalists, lawyers, and historians do not have
the political and moral authority to speak on behalf of the nation; only
Congress can do that. Our lawmakers must now render a verdict in our names.
Democratic statesmen like Joe Lieberman, Pat Moynihan, and Bob Kerrey should
take the lead, along with Republicans like Trent Lott, Bob Livingston,
and yes, Newt Gingrich, to pass a joint resolution of censure. It should
sternly proclaim, "These offenses may not be impeachable, but they are
unacceptable. Whatever his other virtues, the president's acts have violated
his public trust and stand condemned." One day, the next generation will
thank them.</font>
