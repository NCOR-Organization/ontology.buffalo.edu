<p><b><font size=+1>Sexual Harrassment Laws &amp; You - A Primer For Confused
Democrats (Vanity)</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i><font size=+0>This is especially dedicated to Sen. Boxer (D- CA)</font></i>
<p><font size=+0>Sexual Harrassment Crimes In The Workplace</font>
<p><font size=+0>Sen. Boxer's repeated questions along the line of 'consensual
sex' intended to infer that because the relationship was consensual, that
no laws were broken.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Actually, the law <u>was</u> broken, even though it was
consensual.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Right this very minute... any person who served as an
employee of the White House during the time Monica Lewinsky and Clinton
were involved in an affair, can file a legitimate claim of sexual harrassment
against William Jefferson Clinton. Male AND Female. Why is this? The sexual
harrassment laws recognize that there are two sets of victims;</font>
<p><font size=+0>(A) If a subordinate is pressured or threatened for sex,
the subordinate is a victim, and may seek remedy in a court of law.</font>
<p><font size=+0>(B) If a 'manager' and a 'subordinate' engage in a consensual
relationship, all other employees in the company (Male AND Female) are
the victims, since the subordinate usually obtains 'favors' ie: job assistance,
promotions, pay raises, or greater prestige/recognition, which the other
employees did not obtain.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Monica case falls into category (B). When the question
was asked today: "How many other interns received job assistance?" it addressed
the core concern. Since Monica recieved job assistance to land first a
Pentagon job, and second, a job offer at the U.N. and third, a job offer
at Revlon, all other WH employees can validly claim they are victims of
sexual harrassment.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Therefore, when the House Managers assert that a vote
to acquit affects sexual harrassment laws... they are absolutely correct.
Even though the President is very fortunate to be served by very loyal
employees, who would never dream of taking such a case to court, he nevertheless
has committed a clear-cut violation of our nations sexual harrassment laws,
and is vulnerable to a lawsuit from any employee that served in the White
House during the time of Clinton's relationship to Monica Lewinsky.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Generally, if the company does not immediately correct
the situation (sometimes involves transfer of the 'aggressor' but usually
results in immediate termination), the victim may also file suit against
the company for failing to protect their civil rights (after due warning
by reporting the incident.) It is because the company becomes liable after
the first report, that the perpetrator is usually summarily fired.</font>
<p><font size=+0>This explains:</font>
<br><font size=+0>(1) How Clinton broke the Sexual Harrassment laws, and;</font>
<br><font size=+0>(2) Why Clinton cannot admit to a 'relationship'... he
is in severe legal jeopardy as it is. Admitting to a 'relationship' would
all but doom him in a court hearing a sexual harrassment case.</font>
