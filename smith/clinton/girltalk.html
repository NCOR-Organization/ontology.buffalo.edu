<p><b>Newsweek</b>
<br><b>Nov 23, 1998</b> <i>Deborah Tannen</i>
<p><font size=+1>It was the autumn of 1997, and two friends--Monica Lewinsky
and Linda Tripp--were debating life and love. In one exchange, Monica was
recounting a conversation she had with Betty Currie about trying to see
the president. "And blah blah. And I [Monica] said, 'Well, what--' and
then I sort of hesitated and she [Currie] goes, 'Well, did you mention
that you wanted to see him in the note?' And I said, 'Well, yeah, but I
asked him if I could come by on Saturday morning. I didn't know what time
he was leaving.' And she said, 'Oh, well, I think he's leaving too early.'
I said, 'Well, then, you know, maybe tomorrow (inaudible).' And she goes,
'There are a lot of people around.' So--"</font>
<p><font size=+1>Many women heard themselves on that crackly phone line,
listening to the breathy urgency of friends going over and over who said
what, and how that made her feel, and what that made her think; what she
could do, should do, might do; what she should wear, and whether it makes
her look fat. Many men were puzzled to hear talk about relationships in
such detail. They found it boring. Why the difference?</font>
<p><font size=+1>Watch children at play. Little girls' social lives tend
to center on a best friend, and they spend a lot of time sitting and talking--and
telling secrets. Your best friend is the one you tell everything to. And
since talk is the glue that holds relationships together, the nuances of
talk are important: you need to know exactly what was said, in what tone
of voice, to gauge the relationship.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Boys' friendships center more on activities. Your best
friend is the one you do everything with, the one who will stand up for
you if there is a fight. Boys talk to negotiate their positions in a group:
if you can tell other boys what to do and make it stick, your status goes
up, and you have more independence. If you aren't good at challenging other
boys and resisting challenges, you get pushed around. Conversations about
who said what just aren't that important, so boys don't learn to pay attention
to exactly what was said--unless it meant they got put down or pushed around.
It's not that boys and men don't spend hours exchanging seemingly unimportant
details--it's just that the details aren't about relationships and conversations.
They're more likely to be about sports or games. If a man is having an
affair, he might not tell anyone at all, because his idea of friendship
doesn't require that he disclose what's going on in his life. For many
women, though, intimacy entails keeping friends informed of what's going
on in your life. That's what Linda Tripp was counting on.</font>
