<p><font size=+3>&nbsp;Freaks Rule</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;By Coleman Luck</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;I grew up in the Chicago area. In the mid-'50s,
I was in the sixth grade. During those years I had a paper route delivering
the Daily Journal. Talk about anachronism. The only guys who have paper
routes these days are middle-aged immigrants from Cambodia who drive around
in mini-trucks plastering two thousand driveways a morning. Anyway, I had
this paper route and it was a miserable job. Dogs chasing you in the summer
... freezing your butt off all winter long. And once a month I had to collect.
That meant wandering up and down the streets on a Saturday trying to get
jerks to cough up a couple of bucks to keep me in business. But I was good
at it. In sixth grade I won an award. I've forgotten now what it was for,
but the prize was something I will never forget.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;It was an evening at Riverview.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Now, anybody who grew up in Chicago during that
period remembers Riverview. It was one of those great, old, sleazy amusement
parks -- a bloated carnival on a permanent location, with a wooden roller
coaster and a pot load of other dangerous rides that looked like they'd
disintegrate the moment you sat down on them. All summer long, Riverview
advertised on the Chicago TV stations. Their main pitch man was a local
personality named "Two-Ton" Baker," a really fat guy who did noonday programs
for kids. (Another anachronism: kids coming home from school for lunch.).</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;So, all summer there would be these commercials
showing old "Two-Ton" taking up a whole seat on a roller coaster, yelling
at the top of his lungs to display his sheer joy, and probably to prove
that if the thing would hold him, it'd hold anybody.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Riverview was the last gasp of an era. It died with
the coming of the giant, "Nazi-World" theme parks we have today; those
places where everything is perfect all the time -- even the plants which
they change constantly to make sure everything is always "in bloom."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;In contrast to these pristine places, Riverview
was honest, straightforward temptation. It whispered to kids, "Come walk
in my shadows. Come listen to my rats crawling around behind the boards.
Come debauch."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;We loved it.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Anyway, I won this trip to Riverview. And the greatest
part of it was that my parents wouldn't be going along. I'd be with a group
of paper boy "winners" just like me. Young delinquents in training. (This
was long before little girls would stoop to do such crap jobs as paper
routes). And the peak of ecstasy? Our "chaperones" would be the paper boy
"supervisors" from the Daily Journal.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Now, my parents didn't know it, but these guys were
absolute losers. A bunch of lazy drunks who had been promoted far beyond
their level of competence. Going with them was like going alone. They gave
us cash, then went off to spend the day at the local bar.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Oh, joy from heaven! Sixth grade. Money. And Riverview
without adults.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Now, when I say this was an old style amusement
park, I'm not joking. On the boardwalk there was a freak show. Can you
imagine such a thing today? Try to picture a freak show at Disney World!
Aren't we glad that we've matured as a culture to the place where such
things would never be allowed?</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Of course, one could argue that Riverview simply
had an appreciation for diversity, but, we won't go there. So, after you've
gorged yourself on delicious little bags of dead meat (euphemistically
called "hot dogs") and braved all the dangerous rides at least six times,
where's an eleven-year old boy who appreciates diversity gonna be found?
THE FREAK SHOW.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;So, I bought my ticket and walked in.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;I found myself in a stark, ugly, little room, standing
with a small crowd in a roped-off area. There was nothing fancy about the
place. It was as down and dirty as you could get. As my eyes accustomed
themselves to the dim, yellowish light, I noticed that three feet beyond
the rope, sitting on wood pedestals and little chairs, were seven or eight
freaks. And they were the full Monty. Nothing fake here. It was a collection
of poor, sad, human beings with bodies that looked like they'd been created
in a Hollywood visual-effects house.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The instant you walked in, there was a seriousness
about the place. Nobody laughed. Nobody talked. The freaks looked at you
and you looked at them ... and then you left.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;But on that particular day, something happened in
that room that I will remember as long as I live.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;One of the freaks was a little old woman, probably
in her 60s. No more than three feet tall, her face was deformed beyond
ugliness. All of the poor creature's limbs bent in the wrong direction.
There she sat, expressionless. You could imagine that she'd done this all
of her life. I tried not to stare, but I couldn't help myself. I'd never
seen anything quite like her.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Suddenly, into the room walked a man carrying a
little girl about 3 years old. Why this idiot had brought her there, no
one could imagine. I was only 11 and I was appalled. Of course, at the
time, there was no "rating system" for freak shows, so how could you blame
him?</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Anyway, the man with the little girl walked along
the rope staring at the freaks. For some reason, he stopped in front of
the little old woman. The instant the child saw this frightening creature,
she became terrified and started to sob.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;It was a horrible moment. Then, as I watched, that
little, deformed, grandmotherly woman started to cry, too. Quietly, without
a sound, the tears ran down her face. After all the years of being stared
at, all the years of loneliness and pain -- the humanity in her eyes was
overwhelming.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Then, as I watched, that little woman began to talk
to the little girl. Softly, with a voice like your grandmother and mine,
she tried to comfort her, to take away her fear, to reach out with words,
because her arms weren't long enough and they bent in the wrong direction.
It was one gentle heart whispering to another. Now, 11-year old boys are
not known for their deep sensitivity. But, if I live to be a thousand,
I will never forget that scene. Over forty years have passed since that
night. Riverview has long gone. And I was thinking about freaks the other
day...</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;We've heard a great deal over the past months about
the idea that we are a nation ruled by law.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Untrue.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;We are a nation ruled by stories. The stories we
love reveal who we are and what we are becoming. Based on that fact, William
Jefferson Clinton belongs in the White House. He has the moral right to
remain there for the rest of his life. Why? Because he is the living expression
of our collective story. And if we were going to make that story into a
film, it would be titled, "Freaks Rule." Not the good, honest freaks of
Riverview. The true freaks. Us.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;You and I.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;We are the freaks who stand inside the rope, watching
others wallow in degradation and pain and enjoying the view. We are the
fathers who sit up late at night after our wives and children have gone
to bed, sucking cyberporn off the Internet. We are the mothers titillated
by the human fecal matter that we chew and swallow, dished up to us hot
and steaming every afternoon on television talk shows. We are the hip and
cool young executives screwing each other's brains out after hours on the
conference table, then popping pills to stave off the effects of sexually
transmitted disease. We are the teenagers -- the generation of nightmares
-- swimming in fake blood and gore, loving vicarious mayhem and terror
... the spiritual children of Wes Craven's perverted dreams. Freaks all.
Freaks -- each and every one of us. Freaks who have managed to be born
with the ability to hide our true ugliness.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;What is the breadth and depth of our freakhood?
Nothing less than this: As a nation we are Monica Lewinsky. That poor young
woman is simply our surrogate freak. Monica Lewinsky is our national daughter,
sent to spend her Holy Year Of Shrine Prostitution in the temples of power.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Monica knew the proper position of a worshiper.
On her knees, being inseminated by her "god." And we worship right alongside
her, falling to our knees before the starry host of freaks that we have
created in sports and politics and Hollywood -- desperate for our own fifteen
minutes of glory.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;We need a new Statue of Liberty, and Monica could
be the model. Coiffured and bereted. Twenty stories tall. On her knees
in her semen-stained dress, staring out at the world from New York Harbor,
she could proclaim, "Give me your proud, your arrogant, and your vain,
so that I can show them the pleasures of liberty."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;As much as you hate to hear it, friends, that is
our national story.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;And stories rule.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;But in my heart, I wish I could change our story
and tell a new one. One so radical that everyone would freeze in shock.
Maybe I could make it into a film.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Here's the basic outline: Let's imagine that someone
new was placed in the Oval Office instead of the current occupant. Maybe
for just a month. Of course, the President's chair would be too big for
her. She'd need several phone books just to be seen. She wouldn't be able
to write very well. No rose-garden, bill-signing parties jammed with the
fatuous elite for her. After all, her arms would be too short, and they'd
bend in the wrong directions. When the TV cameras focused on her, many
of us would be filled with anger and revulsion. We'd demand to know why
such a human aberration had been allowed to live; why her mother hadn't
ended her life in a merciful abortion.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;But, she wouldn't listen to our raging. There'd
be nothing we could say that she hadn't heard a thousand times before.
In fact, she probably wouldn't talk to us at all. Instead, she'd talk to
our terrified children. And with her soft words and tears, maybe they'd
be able to see beyond her ugliness into eyes filled with love, beautiful
beyond comprehension ... because in her suffering she had seen the Face
of God.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;If only we had a true, honest freak in the White
House to begin a new, national story! And you know what? I think thirty
days would be long enough. After all, at that freak show in Riverview,
it took only five minutes for the light from Eternity to reach an eleven-
year old boy.</font>
