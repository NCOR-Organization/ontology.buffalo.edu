<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;WASHINGTON TIMES</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;October 16, 1998</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Our very first black female president</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The Republicans are supposed to be obsessed with
sex, the president's libido and Monica's drawers, but it's the president's
dearest friends who want to talk only about sex.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The lawyerly Republicans are trying to focus attention
on the president's lies, witness tampering, attempted jury-rigging and
whether he obstructed justice. The libertines of the left keep trying to
change the subject. But who can blame them? A wench is more interesting
than a writ, a tart a lot more fun than a tort.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The president's defense has evolved from the early
days when he said angrily that he didn't do it. From there, we've heard
that well, he didn't do it, but even if he did, nobody could prove it.
When Monica's dress showed up, and the spinach dip wasn't spinach, well,
OK, but it was about sex, and everybody lies about that.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Now his friends in the arts and crafts argue that
yes, of course it was sex, and only sex, and isn't that just too, too wonderful.
Some of the old guys, like William Styron, wistfully recalling his rising
to erotic occasions in his youth, live vicariously now through the young
president. Bill Styron writes in the New Yorker of being invited to Paris,
to bask in the reflected glory of writers with bigger reputations than
his, watching the girls in their early-summer dresses buzz about Francois
Mitterrand. He thrills to the words of the dying French president: "I don't
know of a single head of state who hasn't yielded to some kind of carnal
temptation, small or large. That in itself is reason enough to govern."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Toni Morrison, the novelist, speculates that despite
his white skin Bill Clinton is our first black president, sprung whole
from an unlikely segregationist culture with all the freewheeling appetites
for loud music, fried food, hot preaching and lubricity between the sheets
acquired from the black folks he grew up with in Hope and Hot Springs.
Miss Morrison is black, so she can get by with exploiting racist stereotypes.
Earl Butz got fired from the Cabinet for telling a tasteless bathroom fable
about comfortable shoes and accommodating ladies, based on such stereotypes.
And he was only joking.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Virginia Vitzthum writes in Salon, the internet
shrine to the pristine conscience of our 42nd president, that Toni Morrison
told only part of the story -- that Bill Clinton is not only our first
black president, but our first female president.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;She cites the evidence. "The first known victim
of child abuse," she writes, "Clinton seemed female from the start -- over-eating,
over-compensating, over-accommodating and more vulnerable than the emotionally
inscrutable Hillary."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The president's critics, she notes, have subjected
the president to a global version of the "male gaze," the subtle and sometimes
not-so-subtle appraisal women know very well: Everyone knows what kind
of underwear he wears; his chubby thighs are a subject of public speculation;
his public "apology" for his sexual naughtiness is publicly measured; he
has been subjected to the misogynistic judgment that "he was asking for
it"; like a teen-ager, he spent hours on the telephone with Monica, gossiping,
memorizing her telephone number, promising to wear her tie on special days,
vowing not to go "all the way"; constantly exhibiting a need to be liked,
dumping friends (Lani Guinier, Joycelyn Elders, gay soldiers, welfare moms,
labor unions) to preserve his own popularity, and being halfhearted about
it when he orders military reprisals against enemies (Sudan, Afghanistan,
Rwanda).</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Most "female" of all, argues Miss Vitzthum in Salon,
the president plays the ultimate girl's game of "technical virginity,"
remaining a "good girl" while doing "everything but" and denying the next
day that he had gone even that far. In sum, a perfect president for the
Gelded Age.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Bill Clinton may or may not be black -- black readers
should address their objections to Toni Morrison -- and if he's female,
he has, despite his po' white origins, certainly acquired a bit of the
polished Delta belle's gift for spinning hoodoo. Florence King, the most
perceptive arbiter of Southern social foibles, could have been writing
about ol' Bill (Our Miss Billie?) when she describes how a belle reckons
that her virginity is self-rejuvenating. This enables her father, among
others, to believe that what he knows can't be true, that his little girl
is no longer untouched by unholy male hands, really is sort of true.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;She hasn't really lost her virginity, the belle
reasons, because among other things, she was drunk, they didn't take off
all their clothes, they didn't do it in a bed, she'll never see him again,
and -- this is the most persuasive excuse of all --it happened in New York
City.</font>
<p><font size=+0>This is the female version of the president's rationalizing
his turning the Oval Office into a low-rent bordello, that "it depends
on what your definition of is, is," and how you define being "alone."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Viva la difference, such as may survive.</font>
