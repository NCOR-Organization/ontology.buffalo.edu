and we began taking casualties from rocket fire 10 minutes after arriving
in South Vietnam? Where were you when my best friend triggered a landmine
and died in my arms, while I was covered with body parts, bone fragments,
and several ounces of white hot shrapnel in my legs and arms? Where were
you when I crawled on my belly through a rice paddy, scared and angry,
clearing a mine field with a k-bar knife so our Marine corpsman could help
a Marine who had just had his legs and his manhood blown off by a landmine,
and was screaming for his mother? Where were you when we arrived back on
American soil, only to be cursed and have rotten eggs thrown at us? Where

you on the MIA/POW issue?"</font>

overlooking the DMZ and North Vietnam? I echo the others on this page:
Where were you then, but even more, WHERE in the hell are you now when
you are in a position to help those that you deserted thirty some years
ago? Abandoning them again? Remember, they served their country and fought
for you to be able to make the choice that you made. Mr. President, I want
you to remember this when you try to sleep at night. There are veterans
out there beyond the White House walls that are going without food, shelter,
and medical care that they should be getting, because they fought and bled
for their country, while you a politician, sleep warm, eat good, and get
free medical care just because of their sacrifices. Do something for our

it seems to me that experience could have been better. I gave up a LOT.
I was too young and stupid to realize that I COULD have been a Rhodes scholar,

trails instead, (to each his own?). Did I have the choices YOU did? Probably
not, but I understood that if I fought for America, right or wrong, that
America would fight for me. Instead, it seems like they sucked what they
could out of me and then kinda hoped I'd just go home somewhere and shut
up. I lost a lot, a lot I didn't even know I had, fighting for America.
In retrospect, I guess I SHOULD have done it your way, then I could be
President and you could be a lonely, hurting frightened GRUNT in Vietnam,
fighting for America. Because isn't that what you still espouse? Fight
FOR America and she'll fight for you? Yep, I guess YOU had it figured out

Bill. Your years of dope smoking and panty chasing have secured you your
place in history. Your time in office will soon end, but your legend will
live on. The Clinton Administration is the most corrupt in the history
of these United States, and it all started with a man who never found honor
and who sold his soul for popularity. Prom night's over, Billy Boy. Hope
you had fun."</font>

<p><font size=+0>"Where were you, Bill Clinton, when I was trying to give
The Nam veterans the respect we Korean War veterans were given? Where were
you in your golden youth, Bill Clinton, when your youthful fellow socialist-junkie
liberals partied, protested, and sought relevance in the streets, gutters,
and legislatures of this great country? (Their youthful activities brought
us a variety of social diseases, cancerous conditions still with us, conditions
that are increasing in severity.) Where were you when tens of thousands
of differently committed youngsters became men and women through the fire
and fury of combat, tens of thousands of whom became one with the earth,
their bleeding a sacred act of selfless sacrifice to the political gods
of the moment? Those youngsters gave up their youth while you enjoyed yours.
When history considers this period of time, Bill Clinton, it will not be
kind and it will ask, 'Where were you, Bill Clinton, when those thousands
of men and women became youngsters forever, without the opportunity to
grow old?' "</font>

<p><font size=+0>"Where were you when Ellis E. Austin was shot down over
North Vietnam, 21 April 1966, two weeks before he was to retire? This three
war veteran didn't have to serve in Vietnam but he did because he felt
it was his duty. He left behind three children and a wife. His wife never
remarried and died of a broken heart in 1990, never knowing if he was dead
or alive. His oldest daughter managed to put herself through college, with
no help from the government because of his MIA status. His other daughter
died of cancer, most likely from all the stress the family went through.
His son is still a lost soul till this day. Please, bring Austin home so
that he once again can be on the American soil that he fought so dearly
to protect.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"Where are you NOW? You need for once in your life take
a stand. Stand up for the men that fought battles for your freedom, stand
up for the men that you are now sending to foreign shores. Lord, if you
had inhaled, at least you would have done something!"</font>

<p><font size=+0>"Bill, I won't ask where you were when I was pulling my
good friends body parts from out of the rubbish that was once a hut to
sleep in. Nor need I ask what you were doing all those nights I was buried
in the mud and saw grass, covered with a poncho to try and keep out the
mosquitoes in 100+ degree weather. As your past has caught up with you,
'now we know the rest of the story,' so no need to ask where you were when
our Great Country called its true patriots to go in harms way. We went,
we didn't ask why, we were proud! We are Patriots and proud of that, too
!!! The only thing you can do to feel that pride is use your position to
see to the health and welfare of the Veterans that kept that position free
for you, by keeping a Hitler or some commie from taking it.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"I know it will be impossible for you to do this as your
appointees, i.e., Sara E. Lister, Assistant Secretary of the Army, speaking
with your authority, says the Marines are people who wear those 'checkerboard
fancy uniforms and stuff' and are 'extremists' and 'a little dangerous.
'A little dangerous, hell, if you can find one alive, ask any enemy of
this country who ever met a Marine how dangerous they really are.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"It's good for you that you can't run for another term,
as vets vote, and this time the homos wouldn't be able to keep you in!"</font>
