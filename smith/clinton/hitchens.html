crooked President in history?</font></font></b>
<p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><font size=+0>In this searing
indictment, Christopher Hitchens argues that the Clinton years have been
marked by conservatism, cowardice and corruption</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Sunday April 18,
1999</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>In his hot youth
in the 1960s, Bill Clinton had been, on his own account, a strong supporter
of the Civil Rights movement. Recalling these brave days during the April
1997 anniversary celebrations of Jackie Robinson's victory over Jim Crow
in baseball, he said:</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>When I was a young
person, both I and my family thought that the segregation which dominated
our part of the country was wrong… So he was like - he was fabulous evidence
for people in the South, when we were all arguing over the integration
of the schools, the integration of all public facilities, basically the
integration of our national life. Whenever some bigot would say something,
you could always cite Jackie Robinson… You know, if you were arguing the
integration side of the argument, you could always play the Jackie Robinson
card and watch the big husky redneck shut up [here the transcript shows
a chuckle] because there was nothing they could say.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Actually, there would
have been something the big husky redneck could have said. 'Huh?' would
have about covered it. Or perhaps: 'Run along, kid.' Jackie Robinson -
a lifelong Republican - broke the colour line in baseball when Clinton
was six. He retired from the game in 1956, when Clinton was nine. The Supreme
Court had decided in favor of school integration a year before that. Perhaps
the eight-year-old boy wonder did confront the hefty and the white-sheeted
with his piping treble, but not even the fond memoirs of his doting mama
record the fact.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>As against that,
at the close of Clinton's tenure as governor, Arkansas was the only state
in the union that did not have a Civil Rights statute. Let us consult the
most sympathetic biography of Clinton, The President They Deserve, by Martin
Walker, the Guardian's US correspondent. Described as 'truly sensational'
by Sidney Blumenthal in the New Yorker, Walker's book includes an account
of Clinton's electoral defeat in Arkansas in 1980. Clinton had begun his
two years at the State House by inviting the venomous old segregationist
Orval Faubus, former governor of Arkansas, to a place of honour at the
inaugural ceremony (a step that might have caused Jackie Robinson to raise
an eyebrow) but not even this was enough to protect him against vulgar
local accusations of 'nigger-loving'. The crunch moment came in the dying
days of the Carter administration, when Cuban refugees were stuffed into
an emergency holding pen at Fort Chafee, and protested against their confinement.
As Walker phrases it: 'The ominous black-and-white shots of dark-skinned
Cuban rioters against white-faced police and Arkansans had carried a powerful
subliminal message.' The boyish governor vowed to prevent any more Cubans
from landing on Arkansas soil, and declared loudly that he would defy the
federal government 'even if they bring the whole US army down here'. This
echo of the rebel yell was correctly described by Paul Greenberg, columnist
for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, as 'a credible imitation of Orval E.
Faubus'. Walker omits that revealing moment, but describes the conclusion
Bill and Hillary drew from the ensuing reverse at the polls: 'The lessons
were plain: never be outnegatived again.'</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Perhaps this dictum
only occurs to Walker in the 'subliminal' sense. But its provenance is
well-established. George Wallace, defeated by a less polished racist in
an electoral tussle in long-ago Alabama, swore in public 'never to be out-niggered
again'. This slogan was well known, and well understood, in all the former
states of the Old Confederacy. And after 1980, Clinton clearly began to
evolve a 'southern strategy' of his own.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>In the 1992 run for
the Democratic nomination, that strategy became plain for anyone willing
to see it. Clinton took care to be photographed at an all-white golf club,
and also standing at a prison-farm photo-op, wearing his shades while a
crowd of black convicts broke rocks in the sun. Taxed with long-time membership
in the 'exclusive' golf club - 'inclusiveness' being only a buzz-word away
- Clinton calmly replied that the club's 'staff and facilities' were integrated
- a 'legally accurate' means of stating the obvious fact that the help
was coloured.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>In January 1992 Clinton
quit the thick of the New Hampshire primary to fly to Arkansas and give
personal supervision to the execution of Rickey Ray Rector. Rector was
a black lumpen failure, convicted of a double murder, who had shot himself
in the head on arrest and achieved the same result as a frontal lobotomy
would have done. He understood his charge and trial and sentence not at
all. After a decade on Death Row his execution number came up in a week
when Clinton, according to one report of the polls, had lost 12 points
as a result of the Gennifer Flowers disclosures. These two 'numbers' were
made to intersect. In 1988, Clinton had backed the ludicrous presidential
campaign of Michael Dukakis, who had suffered from a sleazy 'subliminal'
campaign about a dusky parole-breaking rapist named Willie Horton. In the
week of the Flowers revelations, Time magazine helpfully inquired: 'Suppose
Clinton does sew up the nomination by mid-March and the Republicans discover
a Willie Horton in his background?' Rickey Ray Rector was the perfect rebuttal
to such annoying speculations.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>A few columnists
commented with disgust on this human sacrifice, but the press pack preferred
to use Clinton's successful lying about Gennifer Flowers as the test of
his fitness for high office.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>It was not until
more than a year later that the whole story of Rector's last days was recounted
by Marshall Frady in the New Yorker. Served his traditional last meal,
Rector had left the pecan pie on the side of the tray, as he explained
to his queasy guards, 'for later'. Strapped to a gurney, he had tried to
help his executioners find a viable vein (his blood vessels were impaired
by an anti-psychotic drug) before they inflicted a 'cut-down' and slashed
the crook of his arm with a scalpel to insert a catheter. It seems he thought
they were physicians trying to help him. For many poor Americans, jail
is the only place where doctors, lawyers, teachers and chaplains are, however
grudgingly, made available to them. An hour was spent on the cut-down process,
before the death-giving chemicals could kick in. Warden Willis Sargent,
a tough former army non-com, was assailed by misgiving as the deadline
approached. 'Rickey's a harmless guy,' he said. 'This is not something
I want to do.' The chaplain, Dennis Pigman, resigned from the prison system
shortly afterwards, saying: 'I hate murder. I hate murderers. But to execute
children? What was done to Rickey Ray Rector was in itself, absolutely,
a crime. A horrible crime. We're not supposed to execute children.'</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Well, that of course
depends on the needs of the hour, and the requirements of a 'New Democrat'.
Most nauseating, in Frady's account, was the Pharisaic conduct of Governor
Clinton himself. At all times, he pretended - to Rector's lawyer Jeff Rosenzweig
and to others who managed to reach him in the closing moments - that this
was a very painful moment for him personally. But that same affectation
exposed itself when he received a telephone call from his friend Carolyn
Staley, director of the Governor's Commission on Adult Literacy. Hearing
on the radio that Rector's execution was stalled by the snag of finding
a usable vein, she telephoned her friend Bill and he called her back and
- well, I'll let Marshall Frady tell it:</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>She told him: 'I
just wanted to let you know that I'm praying for you about the execution
tonight,' and he replied in a groan: 'It's just awful. Just terrible, terrible.'
As she recalls it now, 'I heard in his voice a self - a depth of anguish
- I'd never, never heard in him before.' She then told him: 'You know,
he's not even dead yet.' 'What?'she remembers him exclaiming. 'What?' From
his startlement, it was obvious to her that the conference in which he
had been absorbed had not exactly been a 'blow by blow' account of Rector's
fate… Staley then told him: 'Bill, I'm so sorry. We've had two executions
this week, haven't we.' She meant the Flowers allegations. 'He just groaned,'
she remembers, and they moved on to discussing that topic. Ultimately,
she says, the conversation wound up 'much more about the Gennifer Flowers
matter' than about what was happening to Rector at that moment down at
Cummins.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Easy to believe.
One is compelled to acknowledge the versatility, and the quick change between
ostentatious pain-feeling and everyday political instinct. This moment
deserves to be remembered for a number of reasons: first, it introduces
a Clintonian mannerism of faux 'concern' that has since become tediously
familiar; second, it illuminates his later attitude towards matters racial,
and penal; and third, it marks the first of many times that Clinton would
deliberately opt for death as a means of distraction from sex.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>I followed Clinton
from New Hampshire to Arkansas to California to New York that season, noticing
with subdued admiration the ways in which his fans and staffers would recommend
him in private. Most amazing was the frequently heard observation that
Clinton, as a Southerner, 'understood black people'. This extraordinary
piece of condescension was convertible currency, as it turned out, because
of the jolt delivered by the disorders in Los Angeles. Nervous voters found
Bush's response to be insufficiently fuzzy. Clinton, it was widely assumed,
would be more 'caring' and 'healing'. Clinton gave the City of the Angels
a wide berth, and limited his comments to some platitudes, taken from the
playbook of neo-conservatism, about the 'culture of poverty' in South Central.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>That very idiom -
naturally concerned yet none the less strict - was to become the substratum
of his 'comfort level' with black Americans while in office. Obviously
on good personal terms with Vernon Jordan and Ron Brown and Mike Espy,
Clinton also rocked to Aretha Franklin on the Mall during his inauguration
and invited Maya Angelou to deliver a piece of doggerel poetry at the ceremony
itself. Well versed in the cant of Southern Baptist rhetorical uplift,
the new President was capable of working the crowd at black church services
just as, infinitely protean in devotional matters, he never looked out
of place standing next to Billy Graham or Mother Teresa. However, there
were certain occasions when push, to employ an old political clich&eacute;,
came to shove.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>One test of Clinton's
loyalty to his black friends and colleagues involved his surgeon-general,
Dr Joycelyn Elders. She asked whether it might be wise to lift the prohibition,
not of soft narcotics, but on any debate about decriminalising them. The
striking thing about Clinton's rapid response was not his stony opposition
to decriminalisation but his vehement opposition to the merest mention
of the topic. It was a debate, not a proposal, that he forbade. In effect,
he told his surgeon-general to shut up. At another public forum, where
the subject was sexual wellbeing among teenagers, Dr Elders proposed an
open discussion of masturbation, as well as of the existing choice between
latex sheaths and abstinence. The presidential firing that followed was
peremptory. It was as if the good doctor had publicly defiled the temple
of her own body. One feels almost laughably heavy-footed in pointing out
that Mrs Clinton's prim little book, It Takes A Village, proposes sexual
abstinence for the young, and that the President was earnestly seconding
this very proposal while using an impressionable intern as the physical
rather than moral equivalent of a visual aid.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>By late 1998 it was
being openly said in Democratic quarters that Clinton was being lynched
by a posse of big and husky rednecks. On the floor of the House, with the
evident approval of the Democratic leadership, Maxine Waters said the defence
of this wronged man was the moral equivalent of the fight against slavery
and segregation. During the Senate trial, the White House fielded a young
black woman attorney, Cheryl Mills, to make essentially the same point.
And when the trial managers failed to call the President's secretary Betty
Currie, the race card was played yet again. Clinton's spinners successfully
spread the word that the senators feared to question a shy and dignified
black lady (whose life, incidentally, had been made a hell of lawyer's
bills by the actions of her boss) lest she break down and cry. There was
something brilliantly sordid about this last innuendo: nobody knew better
than the White House that a private deal had been made by senators to restrict
the number of witnesses to three. And these potentates had decided Sidney
Blumenthal was a better test of Clinton's human shield than a fragile secretary.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>This sort of tactic
works well enough for the daily news cycle. But it may not be enough to
satisfy the high-minded. The niche market of intellectuals - once described
by Harold Rosenberg as 'the herd of independent minds' - was to be served
by its own hero, Arthur Miller. Writing in the New York Times on 15 October
1998, the author of The Crucible shared the following thoughts:</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Witch-hunts are always
spooked by women's horrifying sexuality awakened by the superstud Devil.
In Europe, where tens of thousands perished in the hunts, broadsides showed
the Devil with two phalluses. And of course mankind's original downfall
came about when the Filthy One corrupted the mother of mankind. In Salem,
witch-hunting ministers had the solemn duty to examine women's bodies for
signs of the 'Devil's Marks' - a suggestion of webbing, perhaps, between
the toes, a mole behind an ear or between the legs, or a bite mark somewhere.
I thought of this wonderfully holy exercise when Congress went pawing through
Kenneth Starr's fiercely exact report on the President's intimate meetings
with Monica Lewinsky. I guess nothing changes all that much.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Oh but surely, Mr
Miller, some things have changed? Paula Jones - the witch or bitch in this
case - did not accuse the President of flaunting two phalluses. Indeed,
she implied it would have taken two of his phalluses to make one normal
one, which could even be part of the reason why he paid her $840,000 to
keep quiet. (This payment involved dipping into the 'blind trust' maintained
by his wife after her success in the cattle-futures and other markets.)
No woman's body was probed by the Starr team. Rather, they examined the
body of the world's most powerful man, as a result of a legal process initiated
by one of the world's least powerful women. And the evidence there discovered
- necessarily a bit grungy - consisted not of 'Devil's Marks' but of matching
DNA.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>The above does not
prove that Clinton is The Evil One, but it does prove that Arthur Miller
is The Stupid One. Would he let it go at that? He would not. Digging a
deeper ditch for himself, and handing up the shovel, he continued:</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Then there is the
colour element. Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning
novelist, is our first black President, the first to come from the broken
home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking
systems.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>Thus, we may have
lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness
by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge
habits and (presumable from the rest of Miller's senescent musings) the
tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same. I remember
when Ronald Reagan's genial caricature of the vodka-soaked welfare mother
was considered 'offensive' by all those with OK opinions, if only because
half the white children in America had been brought up by caring nannies
- sober and decent black ladies - who had to tend to their own children
when they had finished with their day jobs. But in Reagan's day, the children
of the most shiftless white or black mother were still guaranteed a Federal
minimum. And Reagan would never have dared to stage a Primary Colors photo-op
execution - if only for fear of the fulminant liberal response that Clinton
avoided. In the asinine remarks of Miller, the Left's hero of the 1950s,
political correctness has achieved its own negation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Geneva,Arial,sans-serif"><font size=-1>In July 1998, during
the third and last televised forum of his national 'dialogue' on race,
Clinton was confronted by the Native American poet and novelist Sherman
Alexie, who complained that many of his fellows were still living in the
US version of the Third World. Responding, Clinton announced that his grandmother
had been one-quarter Cherokee. This claim, never advanced before, would
if true have made him the first Native American President. It didn't wash
with Alexie, who later observed that people 'are always talking about race
in coded language. What they will do is come up to me and say they're Cherokee'.
Clinton did his best to be the first to laugh. Within weeks, his symbolic
pandering brought him a balance of black sympathy in the polls. He had
hired Jesse Jackson as minister of choice, and he had closed his 'atonement'
appeal for the 1998 elections at a fund-raiser in a black church in Baltimore
- an unconstitutional action for which he was later sued by Americans United
for the Separation of Church and State. By these last-minute improvisations,
he had become the first President to play the race card both ways - once
traditionally and once, so to speak, in reverse.</font></font>

<p>&nbsp;Better stick with cricket, Hitch! Robinson came into the majors
in 1947, which gives him a nine--not three!--year major league career assuming
the 1956 retirment date is right.

<br>YES, he is without any doubt, the most corrupt, criminal, lying, yellow
bellied, chicken sh**t president we have ever had to put up with. I have
been voting in presidential elections for over 50 years, and have NEVER
voted for a Democrat, but, even though all elections did not favor my votes,
at least I could understand and look forward to the next election. Never,
in all of this time, have I had the desire to see harm come to any of our
leaders, until now....This creature, fresh out from under a slimy rock,
should be thrown out of office by any means, before he corrupts the whole
country, and gets the rest of the world mad at us......Bob

<br>Hitchens represents an important element of the left that is principled.
They're not a large group but if they start gaining steam, they will be
much louder and meaner than the right ever thought about being. They don't
give up either.

<p><i>the conference in which he had been absorbed had not exactly been
a 'blow by blow' account of Rector's fate</i>
<p>&nbsp;More likely it was the kind of 'blow by blow' activity he was
engaged in with Monica while he talked by phone with a congressman about
sending troops to Bosnia.

<p><i>Jackie Robinson - a lifelong Republican - broke the colour line in
baseball when Clinton was six. He retired from the game in 1956, when Clinton
was nine.</i>
<p><i>Better stick with cricket, Hitch! Robinson came into the majors in
1947, which gives him a nine--not three!--year major league career assuming
the 1956 retirment date is right.</i>
<p>We aughter keep an eye on this pair, this 'Mrs' and 'Mr' Hildebeast-Rotten
Beezelbubba-Cli ton, they're a pair of prophets, I tell you.
<p>Bill, whatever the numbers, had Jackie Robinson and "black church burnings"
[For the insurance?] all figgered before he could walk and Hildebeast knew
already when she was born, in 1947, that New Zealand bee-keeper, Ed Hillary,
was going to be the first, with his Sherpa, Tensing, to climb Mount Everest,
in 1953 -- and so, named herself after him!!
<p>And there is a persistant little rumor getting about that Chris Hitchens,
habitual drunkard and probable alcoholic, is off the booze.
<p>If that is the case there is a very good chance he will join our team.
Emotional and intellectual growth tends to pick up where it left off on
being pickled:- preserved in place, as it were, by habitual drunkedness;-
when the religious and/or psychic experience which Carl Jung observed to
be a requirement for sobriety in an alcoholic, kicks in.
<p>Almost a dead cert, London to a brick, as it were, that a smart and
courageous feller like Chris, when he is sobered up, will discover he is
a latent, libertarian, Capitalist.

<br>On the mark: his nailing the fraudulent and over-rated Miller an out-an-out
Stalinist in his youth who pretends, in his works, to be greatly concerned
about witch hunts. Stalin was the all-time champion false accuser who sent
millions to graves for crimes that did not occur.
<p>&nbsp;Off the mark: the assertion that half the white children in America
had black nannies. An idiotic assertion given the fact that blacks make
up 11% of the population and the observable lack of nannies in most households.
<p>&nbsp;But still a great read. His book should cause\ a small sensation
when published.

<br>He is a Libertarian....you you can forget the Capitalist, If Hitchens
ever declares himself a capitalist, I'll kiss Bill Clinton's .....well,
you get the point. I also think it's nobody's business but his how much
he drinks. I get so sick of hearing this crap over and over. Frankly, the
way he thinks and writes ... we would profit by sending a couple of cases
of Johnny Walker Red to every registered member of the Washington Press
Club, it might improve the news coverage we get.

<br>Very interesting article by Hitchins.
<p>&nbsp;What strikes me most about Clinton's whole life story is that
it is fraught with "feelgood" fabrications. Things are said and done to
contribute to a carefully crafted impression, not because because those
things are right or good.
<p>&nbsp;I think it is fitting for every word and deed to be examined in
light of the "I didn't inhale" and "I did not have sex with that woman..."
statements. When it was profitable to be anti-abortion while running in
Arkansas, he was anti-abortion. When it was profitable to be pro-abortion
when running for the office of President, he was pro-abortion. When it
is convenient to be troubled by burning churches be troubled, even though
no churches burned. You can follow these types of threads ad nauseum and
arrive at the oracle of prevarication.
<p>&nbsp;With that for background, just what are you supposed to think
when you read of his Jackie Robinson comments?

<hr>To: Brian Mosely</font></b>
<br><i><b>Arthur Miller:</b> Then there is the colour element. Mr Clinton,
according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first
black President, the first to come from the broken home, the alcoholic
mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems.</i>
<p><i><b>Hitchens:</b> Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine
diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms:
broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable
from the rest of Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation
and to shameless perjury about same.</i>
<p>Bingo, Chris. But remember, Toni Morrison didn't just say that he was
the first black President; she also said that he was "the blackest President
we would see in my or my grandchildren's lifetime."
<p>Morrison's wording left open the possibility that even an African-American
President wouldn't be "black" enough for her. Colin Powell or Alan Keyes
spring to mind as the type of black President that would pale before Clinton,
if you'll pardon the expression.
<p>Years ago, I was in Los Angeles on business without a rental car, and
rather than rely on the almost non-existent bus system in L.A., I chose
to walk about a dozen long blocks while wearing my best suit in an unfamiliar
Hollywood neighborhood. I came across a homeless black man who asked me
for spare change. I don't do spare change, and just passed right by him.
His reaction? "You so busy trying to be white."
<p>I wanted to just spin around and ask him, "If I am 'being white', what
is 'being black?' Laying in a doorway and begging people who work for a
living for spare change and getting angry went people don't feed whatever
habit got you here?"
<p>That's what I wanted to do. I decided against it, since I wouldn't know
where to go for help if he hit me with a bottle or something.
