a statement delivered to Congress today, a group of over 430 law professors
declared that Kenneth Starr's charges against President Clinton "do not
cross the threshold" of high crimes and misdemeanors warranting impeachment.
The group of professors, which described itself as non-partisan, includes
legal scholars from law schools across the country, including Harvard,
Yale, Georgetown, University of Chicago, Stanford and UCLA. "Our conclusion,"
wrote Yale Law School's Jed Rubenfeld, a leading constitutional scholar,
in an accompanying letter, "is that impeachment, to be constitutionally
justified, demands either grossly heinous criminality or grossly derelict
misuse of official power. And in our judgment, the Starr Report just doesn't
contain evidence of this sort." Another signatory, Susan Low Bloch of the
Georgetown University Law Center, said the disparate group of professors
took the unusual step of jointly drafting the letter because they were
concerned that the impeachment process would damage the office of the presidency:
"We fear that if the House decides to impeach President Clinton for the
conduct alleged in the Starr Referral, it will lower the bar for what warrants
impeachment, will make future presidents too beholden to the Congress,
will move us precariously, and unconstitutionally, toward a parliamentary
system, and will dangerously weaken the office of the presidency for the
foreseeable future."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>The law professors'
statement follows a similar <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/news/1998/10/30newsb.html">declaration</a>
that was signed by over 400 distinguished American historians.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>The text of the law
professors' statement follows:</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>The Honorable Newt
Gingrich, Richard Gephardt, Henry Hyde and John Conyers; Speaker of the
House, Minority Leader, Chair of the Judiciary Committee, Ranking Member
of the House Judiciary Committee United States House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Dear Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Hyde and Mr. Conyers:</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Did President Clinton
commit "high Crimes and Misdemeanors" warranting impeachment under the
Constitution? We, the undersigned professors of law, believe that the misconduct
alleged in the report of the Independent Counsel, and in the statement
of Investigative Counsel David Schippers, does not cross that threshold.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>We write neither as
Democrats nor as Republicans. Some of us believe that the President has
acted disgracefully, some that the Independent Counsel has. This letter
has nothing to do with any such judgments. Rather, it expresses the one
judgment on which we all agree: that the allegations detailed in the Independent
Counsel's referral and summarized in Counsel Schipper's statement do not
justify presidential impeachment under the Constitution.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>No existing judicial
precedents bind Congress's determination of the meaning of "high Crimes
and Misdemeanors." But it is clear that Members of Congress would violate
their constitutional responsibilities if they sought to impeach and remove
the President for misconduct, even criminal misconduct, that fell short
of the high constitutional standard required for impeachment.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>The President's independence
from Congress is fundamental to the American structure of government. It
is essential to the separation of powers. It is essential to the President's
ability to discharge such constitutional duties as vetoing legislation
that he considers contrary to the nation's interests. And it is essential
to governance whenever the White House belongs to a party different from
that which controls the Capitol. The lower the threshold for impeachment,
the weaker the President. If the President could be removed for any conduct
of which Congress disapproved, this fundamental element of our democracy
-- the President's independence from Congress -- would be destroyed. It
is not enough, therefore, that Congress strongly disapprove of the President's
conduct. Under the Constitution, the President cannot be impeached unless
he has committed "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Some of the charges
raised against the President fall so far short of this high standard that
they strain good sense: for example, the charge that the President repeatedly
declined to testify voluntarily or pressed a debatable privilege claim
that was later judicially rejected. Such litigation "offenses" are not
remotely impeachable. With respect, however, to other allegations, careful
consideration must be given to the kind of misconduct that renders a President
constitutionally unfit to remain in office.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Neither history nor
legal definitions provide a precise list of high crimes and misdemeanors.
Reasonable people have differed in interpreting these words. We believe
that the proper interpretation of the Impeachment Clause must begin by
recognizing treason and bribery as core or paradigmatic instances, from
which the meaning of "other high Crimes and Misdemeanors" is to be extrapolated.
The constitutional standard for impeachment would be very different if
different offenses had been specified. The clause does not read, "Treason,
Felony and other Crime" (as does Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution),
so that any violation of a criminal statute would be impeachable. Nor does
it read, "Adultery, Fornication or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,"
implying that any conduct deemed to reveal serious moral lapses might be
an impeachable offense.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>When a President commits
treason, he exercises his executive powers, or uses information obtained
by virtue of his executive powers, deliberately to aid an enemy. When a
President is bribed, he exercises or offers to exercise his executive powers
in exchange for corrupt gain. Both acts involve the criminal exercise of
presidential powers, converting those awful powers into an instrument either
of enemy interests or of purely personal gain. We believe that the critical,
distinctive feature of treason and bribery is grossly derelict exercise
of official power (or, in the case of bribery to obtain or retain office,
gross criminality in the pursuit of official power). Non-indictable conduct
might rise to this level. For example, a President might be properly impeached
if, as a result of drunkenness, he recklessly and repeatedly misused executive
authority.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Much of the misconduct
of which the President is accused does not involve the exercise of executive
powers at all. If the President committed perjury regarding his sexual
conduct, this perjury involved no exercise of presidential power as such.
If he concealed evidence, this misdeed too involved no exercise of executive
authority. By contrast, if he sought wrongfully to place someone in a job
at the Pentagon, or lied to subordinates hoping they would repeat his false
statements, these acts could have involved a wrongful use of presidential
influence, but we cannot believe that the President's alleged conduct of
this nature amounts to the grossly derelict exercise of executive power
sufficient for impeachment.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>Perjury and obstruction
of justice can without doubt be impeachable offenses. A President who corruptly
used the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obstruct an investigation would
have criminally exercised his presidential powers. Moreover, covering up
a crime furthers or aids the underlying crime. Thus a President who committed
perjury to cover up his subordinates' criminal exercise of executive authority
would also have committed an impeachable offense. But making false statements
about sexual improprieties is not a sufficient constitutional basis to
justify the trial and removal from office of the President of the United
States.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>It goes without saying
that lying under oath is a very serious offense. But even if the House
of Representatives had the constitutional authority to impeach for any
instance of perjury or obstruction of justice, a responsible House would
not exercise this awesome power on the facts alleged in this case. The
House's power to impeach, like the prosecutor's power to indict, is discretionary.
This power must be exercised not for partisan advantage, but only when
circumstances genuinely justify the enormous price the nation will pay
in governance and stature if its President is put through a long, public,
voyeuristic trial. The American people understand this price. They demonstrate
the political wisdom that has held the Constitution in place for two centuries
when, even after the publication of Mr. Starr's report, with all its extraordinary
revelations, they oppose impeachment for the offenses alleged therein.</font></font>
<p><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1>We do not say that
a "private" crime could never be so heinous as to warrant impeachment.
Congress might responsibly take the position that an individual who by
the law of the land cannot be permitted to remain at large, need not be
permitted to remain President. But if certain crimes such as murder warrant
removal of a President from office because of their unspeakable heinousness,
the offenses alleged in the Independent Counsel's report or the Investigative
Counsel's statement are not among them. Short of heinous criminality, impeachment
demands convincing evidence of grossly derelict exercise of official authority.
In our judgment, Mr. Starr's report contains no such evidence.</font></font><font face="times, times new roman"><font size=+1></font></font>
