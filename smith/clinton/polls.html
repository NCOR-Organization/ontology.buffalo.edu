<p><b><font size=+1>MEN OF PRINCIPLE, MEN OF POLLS</font></b>
<p><b>The Buffalo News, page B-3</b>
<br><b>December 26, 1998</b> <i>Richard Reeves</i>
<p><font size=+0>This is one way to look at the impeachment of President
Clinton: Sincere men and women of principle defeated a man without principles,
a man of polls. At last, justice, right. Good and true belief triumphed
over a communications-age demagogue who believed in nothing but giving
people what they say they want.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Unfortunately, self-government and representative democracy
are not that pure. One man's principle can be another man's tyranny. The
puritan standards imposed on a sinful nation by conservative Republicans
-- the principles that brought down both the president and their own leader,
Robert Livingston -- are, by my personal principles, the imposition of
religious totalitarianism on what is meant to be political pluralism.</font>
<p><font size=+0>That does not exonerate or even excuse the impeached president.
Whatever one thinks of his personal and legal sinning, his political wrongdoing
has been an addiction to polling, focus groups and the other paraphernalia
of survey research.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton is a man of numbers who has been less a principled
leader than a facilitator of public opinion. That point was emphasized
once again by his amoral friend, Dick Morris, who has perked up the paperback
edition of his tell-almost-all book about his private public service. This
time Morris publishes the notes of weekly White House meetings to set the
president's agenda by polls on everything from what to do about Iraq to
how to feel about terrorism in Oklahoma City.</font>
<p><font size=+0>So Clinton and his tormentors acted out their roles as
the polar demons of government of the people: the pure democrat channeling
majority opinion, and the pure tyrants of the minority chasing down heretics
and hypocrites.</font>
<p><font size=+0>They are actors playing out the clich&eacute; that history
repeats itself, first as drama, than as farce. This was the farce. The
setting of the play is the South, the old and the new. In the first production,
which ran for most of the century, the people's representatives of the
old South were Democrats, and they destroyed the Democratic Party by refusing
to abandon segregation. The representatives of the new South are Republicans
of old puritan definition, righteous folk afraid that someone, somewhere,
is having fun. And they will destroy the Republican Party over issues of
personal morality.</font>
<p><font size=+0>More than almost anything, the new Southerners and old
conservative allies in the North despise Clinton for his lying and for
what they see as his blasphemy and hypocrisy. My own perception is that
what these puritan tyrants hate most is photographs of Clinton coming out
of church, wife, daughter and Bible in hand -- looking for all the world
like one of them, a Baptist image of the perfect and devout Christian family.</font>
<p><font size=+0>It doesn't bother me. Forced to choose between these aliens,
I would choose the hypocrite. In fact, I lean toward the view that mannered
hypocrisy is absolutely essential to the practice of civilization. Who
can live with the truth all the time, when people ask such things as, "How
do I look?" The truth may make us free, but we would not have any friends.</font>
<p><font size=+0>One of the ways America became great in our own eyes was
by refusing to acknowledge obvious and evil excesses involving men and
women created equal except for their skin color and the greedy thieving
of Bible-toters from what we now call the investing classes. (Fortunately,
the nation has regularly redeemed itself when the hypocrisy reveals itself,
a pattern that led Martin Luther King Jr., for one, to force Americans
to defend their rhetoric with great deeds.)</font>
<p><font size=+0>So much for men of principle. You have to judge such things
by whether or not you agree with the principle. And so much for men of
polls, too.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Having said that, I grew very concerned about the future
of the country the other day, when I bumped into the aforementioned Dick
Morris. He is trying to expand his constituency to include other men who
would be king, beginning with Vice President Al Gore.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"I've got some great ideas for Gore," Morris told me.
"I think there is something going on in the environment and global-warming
and all that. There have been just enough incidents of crazy weather around
the world to make people think maybe the environmental nuts and tree-huggers
are right. I'm going to check it out with a poll and show Gore the numbers."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Oh, great! More Morris numbers are just what Al Gore and
the nation need right now</font>
