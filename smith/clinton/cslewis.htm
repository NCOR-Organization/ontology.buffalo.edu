<p><b><font size=+1>A LETTER FROM MY CONGRESSMAN</font></b>
<p><b>email</b>
<br><b>Oct. 19,1998</b> <i>Congressman Tom DeLay</i>
<p><font size=+0>Dear Mrs. .....: Thank you for contacting me regarding
President Clinton. It is extremely valuable when considering important
issues to know the views and concerns of my constituents and I appreciate
your taking the time to comment.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Like most Americans, I too wish this whole sordid
mess was over. That President Clinton should have to take to the national
airwaves -- without a trace of contrition -- and admit that he has lied
to his family, his friends, and to every American truly degrades the office
he occupies and threatens to tear an irreparable hole in the fabric of
the rule of law, upon which our great nation was founded.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;In a recent editorial, The Houston Chronicle raised
a simple question, "Whatever happened to telling the truth for the simple
sake of honesty . . . trust?" And that's what this is ultimately about
-- trust. Public trust is the lifeblood of leadership, and the cornerstone
of the legitimacy of any government leader. And the higher the position,
the more important that trust becomes because of the seriousness and complexity
of the issues the leader confronts. When the leader is in the position
of putting countrymen in harm's way, protecting his nation's interests
abroad, or making daily decisions affecting literally everyone in the country,
that leader has an even greater responsibility to protect that trust against
all threats, temptations, and misdeeds.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;President Clinton has squandered this trust, sullied
the office of the presidency, and betrayed the American people. While some
people argue that this is merely about sex, they are gravely mistaken.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;This crisis facing our nation is about whether the
President broke the law of the land and, by extension, whether he broke
his sworn oath of office. Furthermore, if the President of the United States
cannot be held accountable for his actions, and face the resulting consequences,
why should any other American citizen believe in the rule of law? How do
you teach your children that bad actions yield bad results when the President
can cheat and lie without consequence and still be allowed to carry on
his duties?</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;A proclamation by author C.S. Lewis fits this situation,
"The very idea of freedom, presupposes some objective moral order which
overarches rulers and ruled alike. We and our rulers are of one kind only
so long as we are subject to one law."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;It is bad enough that our President is guilty of
having an extramarital sexual relationship with one of his young interns.
But it is much more damaging that this President looked the American people
in the eye and knowingly lied to us for months. Unfortunately, this has
been a pattern for this Administration. From the various abuses of the
Clinton campaign to Filegate, from Travelgate to Chinagate, the President
has always shown the same pattern: stonewall, delay, obfuscate, and lie.
This conduct is simply unacceptable.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;As I have said before, I believe the President should
resign for the good of the country. The American people deserve to trust
and respect the leader of our nation. This President has abandoned that
trust and respect, not only because he has cheated and lied, but also because
he has engaged in a pattern of unacceptable conduct.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;In 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared
to embark on an inquiry of impeachment, a Democratic representative from
New York made a statement on the House floor that applies to the situation
today. "The president is not a privileged citizen; he must be the model
citizen. Mr. Speaker, the Presidency is not under attack as some would
have us believe. It is rather the conduct of that office within a specific
time frame that we are undertaking to examine on behalf of the American
people.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;That the Presidency is held in low repute today
is not the fault of Congress, the press, or the public. The simple truth
is that what loss of public trust there has been in the Presidency is the
result of activities engaged in on behalf of, in the name of and through
the authority delegated by the incumbent of that high office."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;I take my responsibilities as a Member of Congress
very seriously, which is why I am actively urging this President to resign.
As painful as this ordeal may likely be for our nation, it is something
he must do to preserve and protect the integrity of the executive branch
for future presidents.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Again, thank you for contacting me about this important
issue. Please feel free to write or call anytime I may be of assistance.
It is an honor to serve you in the United States Congress.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Sincerely,</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Tom DeLay</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Member of Congress</font>
<br>&nbsp;
