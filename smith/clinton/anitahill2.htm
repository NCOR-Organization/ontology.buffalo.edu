<h5>
<font size=+0>By ANITA HILL</font></h5>
<font size=+0>BOSTON -- Even before President Clinton referred to the Clarence
Thomas confirmation hearing in his grand jury testimony, comparisons between
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and my testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee were being made. The comparisons usually come in the form of
a question to Democrats: "How do the current accusations differ from those
raised during the Thomas hearing"?</font>
<p><font size=+0>Or more bluntly, "Why aren't women as outraged by what
Bill Clinton did as they were with Clarence Thomas or Bob Packwood?"</font>
<p><font size=+0>Given the difference in the facts, the thinking behind
such comparisons is at best misguided, and at worst dangerous. If impeachment
hearings proceed, it is important for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
to recognize the differences and avoid the circus atmosphere that surrounded
the hearing on Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court nomination.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The substance of sex-related accusations against President
Clinton differs dramatically from those raised against Justice Thomas or
Packwood. According to their testimony, Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky viewed
their relationship as consensual. While their immoral and undignified behavior
no doubt had a negative effect on others in the office and in the Clinton
household, it was not coerced, unwanted or illegal.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In the case of Packwood and Thomas, the accusations involved
sexual harassment. To equate those allegations with an office affair is
to trivialize issues of sexual predation that women face in the workplace
and on the street.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Nor are the situations morally equivalent. The possible
violation of a woman's civil rights is not the same as the emotional pain
and loss of trust that result from extramarital affairs. Equating the two
promotes a form of moral fundamentalism that devalues women and the issues
they face and offers only a formulaic approach to addressing them.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In addition, many of Clinton's critics claim that his
supporters -- especially women -- are guilty of political hypocrisy. On
the surface, the Clinton scandal may suggest hypocrisy on the part of his
supporters, but the same can be said of his detractors as well.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Take Robert Bork's recent comments in an interview on
"Larry King Live." Bork gave a sincere, but altogether tortured explanation
of why the perjury and obstruction of justice charges represent a worse
subversion of democracy than the charges raised in the Iran-contra affair
in the Reagan Administration.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Do we learn anything from looking back at the Thomas hearing?
I hope we learn how difficult and painful it is to address issues involving
sex and power. And as the House Judiciary Committee begins evaluating the
evidence in this case, it should keep in mind another lesson from the Thomas
hearing: the American people not only care about getting the truth, they
also care about how they get it.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Thomas hearing was inherently flawed and lacked credibility.
The Senate rushed to conclude the proceeding, without thinking through
its own role. It soon became apparent that the committee was simply not
competent to conduct a hearing on the legal issue of whether Thomas had
sexually harassed me. People may have chosen sides during the hearing,
but no one believed that the hearing was fair or orderly.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Unfortunately, in the current scandal, the process has
already been tainted in the minds of the public. It began with a tape that
was made illegally. It has been plagued with leaks. And Kenneth Starr's
report and supporting evidence were released before Clinton had a chance
to respond. Clearly the President and Ms. Lewinsky used sex for their own
purposes, but are Starr and the Republicans doing the same thing?</font>
<p><font size=+0>It is up to the House Judiciary Committee to restore the
public's faith in the integrity of the process, and to insure that all
issues receive a fair hearing. The panel can start by asking not how Bill
Clinton's behavior differed from that of Clarence Thomas, but how committee
members can learn from the past to conduct a fair hearing.</font>
