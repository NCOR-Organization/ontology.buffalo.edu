<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>The President also maintained that
none of his sexual contacts with Ms. Lewinsky constituted "sexual relations"
within a specific definition used in the Jones deposition. Under that definition:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>[A] person engages in "sexual
relations" when the person knowingly engages in or causes -- (1) contact
with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any
person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person
. . . . "Contact" means intentional touching, either directly or through
clothing.&nbsp;</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>According to what the President testified
was his understanding, this definition "covers contact by the person being
deposed with the enumerated areas, if the contact is done with an intent
to arouse or gratify," but it does not cover oral sex performed on the
person being deposed. He testified:&nbsp;</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>[I]f the deponent is the
person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is with -- not
with anything on that list, but with the lips of another person. It seems
to be self-evident that that's what it is. . . . Let me remind you, sir,
I read this carefully.</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>In the President's view, "any person,
reasonable person" would recognize that oral sex performed on the deponent
falls outside the definition.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>If Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex
on the President, then -- under this interpretation -- she engaged in sexual
relations but he did not. The President refused to answer whether Ms. Lewinsky
in fact had performed oral sex on him. He did testify that direct contact
with Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or genitalia would fall within the definition,
and he denied having had any such contact.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>When the President was questioned about
this meeting with Ms. Currie in the grand jury, he testified that he recalled
the conversation, but he denied that he was "trying to get Betty Currie
to say something that was untruthful." Rather, the President testified
that he asked a "series of questions" in an effort to quickly "refresh
[his] memory." The President explained: "I wanted to establish . . . that
Betty was there at all other times in the complex, and I wanted to know
what Betty's memory was about what she heard, what she could hear . . .
. [a]nd I was trying to figure [it] out . . . in a hurry because I knew
something was up.")&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>In his grand jury testimony, the
President acknowledged that, "in fairness," Ms. Currie "may have felt some
ambivalence about how to react" to his statements. The President maintained
that he was trying to establish that Ms. Currie was "always there," and
could see and hear everything. At the same time, he acknowledged that he
had always tried to prevent Ms. Currie from learning about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. "[I] did what people do when they do the wrong thing.
I tried to do it where nobody else was looking at it."</font></font></blockquote>

<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>WJC: I don't recall, but as I said,
when she worked at the legislative affairs office, they always had somebody
there on the weekends. I typically worked some on the weekends. Sometimes
they'd bring me things on the weekends. She -- it seems to me she brought
things to me once or twice on the weekends. In that case, whatever time
she would be in there, drop it off, exchange a few words and go, she was
there. I don't have any specific recollections of what the issues were,
what was going on, but when the Congress is there, we're working all the
time, and typically I would do some work on one of the days of the weekends
in the afternoon.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>Q: So I understand, your testimony
is that it was possible, then, that you were alone with her, but you have
no specific recollection of that ever happening?&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1>WJC: Yes, that's correct. It's possible
that she, in, while she was working there, brought something to me and
that at the time she brought it to me, she was the only person there. That's
possible.&nbsp;</font></font>

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>
<font face="Tms Rmn"><font size=+1><font color="#000000">At his grand jury
appearance, the President also was asked about his counsel's statement
to Judge Wright that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying a "sexual relationship"
was equivalent to saying "there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any
manner, shape or form" with President Clinton.... [T]he President was asked
how he lawfully could have sat silent while his attorney -- in the President's
presence and on his behalf -- made a false statement to a United States
District Judge in an effort to forestall further questioning. </font>The
President offered several responses.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>First, the
President maintained that he was not paying "much attention" when Mr. Bennett
said that there is "absolutely no sex of any kind" between the President
and Ms. Lewinsky." The President further stated: "That moment, that whole
argument just passed me by. I was a witness." The President's explanation
is difficult to reconcile with the videotape of the deposition, which shows
that the President was looking in Mr. Bennett's direction when his counsel
made this statement.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Alternatively,
the President contended that when Mr. Bennett said that "there is absolutely
no sex of any kind," Mr. Bennett was speaking only in the present tense
and thus was making a completely true statement. The President further
stated: "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is," and that
"actually, in the present tense that is an accurate statement".... The
President's suggestion that he might have engaged in such a detailed parsing
of the words at his deposition is at odds with his assertion that the "whole
argument passed me by."&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Tms Rmn"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Finally, the
President took issue with the notion that he had any duty to prevent his
attorney from making a false statement to Judge Wright: "Mr. Bennett was
representing me. I wasn't representing him."</font></font></font></blockquote>

<font size=+1>The President said that by <u>receiving</u> oral sex, he
would not "engage in" or "cause" contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of "any person" because "any person" really
means "any <u>other</u> person." The President further testified before
the grand jury: "[I]f the deponent is the person who has oral sex performed
on him, then the contact is with -- <u>not with anything on that list,
but with the lips of another person</u>."&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=+1>The President's linguistic parsing is unreasonable. Under
the President's interpretation (which he says he followed at his deposition),
in an oral sex encounter, one person is engaged in sexual relations, but
the other person <u>is not</u> engaged in sexual relations.</font></blockquote>

<font size=+1>The President also maintained that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit,
as it ultimately was filed denying a "sexual relationship," was not necessarily
inaccurate. He testified that, depending on Ms. Lewinsky's state of mind,
her statement denying a sexual relationship could have been true.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=+1>"I believe at the time that she filled out this affidavit,
if she believed that the definition of sexual relationship was two people
having intercourse, then this is accurate. And I believe that is the definition

deposition also covers acts in which the deponent "cause[d] contact" with
the genitalia or anus of "any person." When he testified to the grand jury,
the President said that this aspect of the definition still does not cover
his receiving oral sex. The President said that the word "cause" implies
"forcing to me" and "forcible abusive behavior."&nbsp; And thus the President
said that he did not lie under oath in denying that he "caused" contact
with the genitalia of any person because his activity with Ms. Lewinsky
did not include any nonconsensual behavior.</font></font></blockquote>
