<p><b><font size=+1>The Starr Report Brings Closure to the Sixties</font></b>
<p><b>Hudson Institute</b>
<br><i>Herbert London &amp; John M. Olin</i>
<p><font size=+0>It has been argued that the age of innocence at the turn
of the century ended with World War I. Similarly, the Vietnam War ended
with Watergate. I would argue that the sixties, the era that nurtured the
baby boomers, has come to an end with the Starr Report.</font>
<p><font size=+0>For several decades the mythology unfolding from the overheated
decade informed American life. There was the Beatles' "All You Need is
Love." There was a counterculture that scorned bourgeois values as hopelessly
retrograde.</font>
<p><font size=+0>There was the mantra of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll. There
was Maslowian self-actualization rather than commitment to family and tradition.
A politics of production, of results, was replaced by a politics of feelings.
("I feel your pain*") And "I" became the center of all things as judgment
itself became a manifestation of narcissism.</font>
<p><font size=+0>These conditions have come home to roost with a vengeance.
For the Starr Report tells Americans as much about cultural degradation
as Clinton's presidential conduct. It is instructive that the president's
apologists argue that private behavior is not as important as his public
role, that any critique of Clinton should be evaluated against a backdrop
of American Puritanism.</font>
<p><font size=+0>This position is understandable only if one scorns bourgeois
values and ignores the symbolic leadership of the president. Who among
us doesn't smirk when the president refers to moral guidance?</font>
<p><font size=+0>It is obvious form the Starr Report that a seamless web
of deceit has characterized the Clinton presidency. From "I did not have
sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky," to renting out the Lincoln bedroom,
to illegal campaign contributions, and questionable favors for donations
to the Democratic Party, the presidency is shameless. But in Clinton's
culture of self-fulfillment and narsasetic ambition, shamelessness doesn't
count.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Who also but a product of polymorphous perversity would
contend that oral sex is not really sex? Who else but a person devoid of
bourgeois constraints can lie looking into a television camera one day
and then relying on the politics of feelings, tells us that the next day,
"I'm sorry I misled you."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Of course none on this is surprising. Clinton also told
the American people "I did not inhale," "I was not drafted," "I did not
have an affair with Gennifer Flowers" and "I will be the most ethical president
in American history." These lies emerged from the falsity of the sixties.</font>
<p><font size=+0>If "all you need is love" principals and ethics may not
count for much. If bourgeois life is hypocritical why shouldn't the president
indulge his sexual fantasies with a White House intern only a few years
older than his daughter. If the self is the core of one's existence, there
aren't any boundaries for appropriate behavior except gratification.</font>
<p><font size=+0>What Kenneth Starr had illuminated is the bankruptcy of
sixties myths. The walls that sustained sixties culture for the boomers
who are now in there forties and fifties have been razed. A "Big Chill"
generation is in deep freeze.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The hallucinogenic express that delivered many sixties
passengers to Despair Station has been derailed. Sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll
have brought Clinton to the eve of destruction. There is nothing for sixties
types to rely on but false memories. Even Woodstock is being reevaluated
by contemporaries who failed to show up for the anniversary concert.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton doesn't feel your pain. He, like many members
of his generation, can feel only personal satisfaction. Starr didn't intend
it, but I am persuaded, his report will be a harbinger of national remoralization.
Americans are now obliged to ask if the person in whom they offer there
trust can be counted on to act responsibly, honorably, trustfully.</font>
<p><font size=+0>From now on presidents will be asked to pass the Clinton
test. This may not assure sound judgement, a rejuvenated economy or a nation
at peace, but it will give Americans what they deserve - a person at the
helm with character.</font>
<p><font size=+0>When critics decry the Starr Report what they are actually
saying is that like Pogo they have confronted the enemy and "he is us."
Clinton imbibed the views of the sixties decade like so many other Americans.
Now it is time to put the sixties to rest along with the Clinton presidency.</font>
