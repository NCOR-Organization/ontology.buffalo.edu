<p><b><font size=+2>THE LAWYERS-Legal Gamesmanship May Take Toll</font></b>
<p><b>The New York Times</b>
<br><b>September 24, 1998</b> <i>By WILLIAM GLABERSON</i>
<p><font size=+0>WASHINGTON -- In the Watergate era, the misdeeds of lawyers
provoked a national discussion about whether "legal ethics" was an oxymoron.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Now, President Clinton's troubles have ignited a new and
broader debate about the role of lawyers in American society. But this
time, the issue is not whether they broke the law but whether lawyers and
their way of thinking have become so pervasive that legalistic gamesmanship
is dominating politics -- and, perhaps, everyday life.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"There's been this intrusion of the adversary process
into life as a whole," said Daniel R. Fischel, professor and dean-elect
of the University of Chicago Law School, "and it colors everything: the
way people interact, what they say, their willingness to cooperate with
each other."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Professor Fischel said the Monica Lewinsky battle seemed
to highlight a growing worry about whether the lawyerly ideal of prevailing
by destroying the opposition had pushed aside other American values like
trust and cooperation.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In the Lewinsky investigation, legal definitions sometimes
seemed to prevail over common sense. Clinton's contortionist language,
which much of the country saw in his videotaped grand jury testimony shown
on Monday, has come to be seen as the ultimate example of such legal hairsplitting.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In his testimony, for example, Clinton wondered aloud
"what the meaning of the word 'is' is," as he explained why he had not
taken issue with his lawyer's earlier comment that "there is absolutely
no sex" between the President and Monica S. Lewinsky.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"If 'is' means is and never has been, that is not -- that
is one thing," he testified. "If it means there is none," he continued,
"that was a completely true statement.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"Now if someone had asked me on that day, 'Are you having
any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky,' that is, asked me a question
in the present tense, I would have said 'no.' And it would have been completely
true."</font>
<p><font size=+0>His answer might have won praise in Trial Tactics 101.
Instead, it drew ridicule and added to the backlash that has been building
across the country against the use of legal fine points and distinctions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"There is a perception increasingly shared by lay people,
but also by lawyers," said Anthony T. Kronman, the dean of Yale Law School,
"that the gulf between the law and common sense has opened up in this crisis
to a considerable degree. And that has caused people to lose confidence
in the law."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Clinton, a former Arkansas Attorney General who has always
seemed drawn to legal distinctions, drew rebukes even from senior Democrats
for asserting that his replies regarding the definition of sexual relations
agreed upon in the Paula Jones suit were "legally accurate."</font>
<p><font size=+0>"The President and his advisers are going to have to accept
that continued legal jousting serves no constructive purpose," said Senator
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate minority leader.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House
minority leader, said, "The considered judgment of the American people
is not going to rise or fall on the fine distinctions of a legal argument."</font>
<p><font size=+0>But the concern that legalisms are leading the country
out the door of ordinary logic has hardly been limited to the White House.
Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has also been fighting
off accusations that his investigation was little more than a lawyer's
artificial construct.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"I am not going to answer your trick questions," Clinton
said to one of the Starr lawyers.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Starr's critics call his investigation a mere perjury
trap, which they say existed solely to impale the President on his own
legalisms. Without the Starr inquiry into whether Clinton lied in a deposition
in a civil suit that was later dismissed, the critics say, there would
be no question of impeachment.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Some of Starr's critics say one explanation for the President's
continuing strong showing in public opinion polls may be that Americans
view the Starr assertions, Clinton's defenses and virtually everything
else about the battle in Washington as legal skirmishes that have little
to do with real life.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Starr's report to Congress included scores of examples
of such lawyerly logic. In great detail, for example, it spoke of lies
Clinton told top aides like John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Lawyers say Starr was inventive in his assertion that
Clinton violated the law by telling lies to his own staff members in private
meetings. Starr argued in his report that Clinton's lies to his staff,
knowing all the while they might be called to testify about his denials,
amounted to obstruction of justice.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Both the President and the independent counsel, said David
W. Leebron, the dean of Columbia Law School, are reinforcing a stereotype
of lawyers and their reasoning that is detached from reality.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"The public perception is that the visible lawyers on
both sides -- including the President -- are not reassuring about the use
of law in pursuing justice in our country," Leebron said. "On the side
of Ken Starr, many people have come to feel, it is legal procedure run
amok -- the use of legal tools totally without discretion and judgment."</font>
<p><font size=+0>In their televised questioning, the Starr lawyers often
seemed unable to resist lawyerly pursuit of the obvious. They defined "phone
sex" and framed such inquiries as "If there is a semen stain belonging
to you on a dress of Ms. Lewinsky's, how would you explain that?"</font>
<p><font size=+0>As the details have come spilling out, it seems that everyone,
even Ms. Lewinsky, who is not a lawyer but knows plenty of them, was addicted
to legal distinctions.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In Ms. Lewinsky's case, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the President's
friend who was helping her get a job, asked her if she and the President
had had an affair, Starr's report said.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Ms. Lewinsky, not yet 25, saw the question as just another
legal maneuver, the Starr report concluded. She answered 'no' because,
prosecutors said, she "interpreted Jordan's questions as, 'What are you
going to say?' rather than 'What are the answers.' "</font>
<p><font size=+0>Long before the Lewinsky case, there had been a growing
concern, even among some legal scholars, about the intrusion of too much
lawyering in America, voiced through books, seminars, cartoons and general
handwringing. The events of recent weeks have catapulted those concerns
to new levels among some of the nation's most influential legal educators.</font>
<p><font size=+0>One legacy of the Lewinsky era is sure to be a re-examination
of the influence of lawyers on the country, said Ronald A. Cass, the dean
of Boston University School of Law.</font>
<p><font size=+0>"The question," Dean Cass said, "will be whether lawyers
are serving any real purpose in life or whether lawyers are simply engaging
in semantic arguments that don't make sense to ordinary people."</font>
<p><font size=+0>That debate, said Derek Bok, a former Harvard Law School
dean and former president of Harvard University, "is very much a reflection
of our culture -- we believe in competition."</font>
<p><font size=+0>"People like the competition," Bok said, "but they want
a kind of wise restraint that is probably asking too much of human nature."</font>
