<blockquote><b><font size=+1>Defining the Presidency Down</font></b>
<p><b>Intellectual Capital</b>
<br><b>October 8, 1998 </b><i>by Pete du Pont</i>
<p><font size=+0>In his 1996 book <i>Miles to Go</i>,Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan (D-NY) identified a salient trend in American social policy; he
called it "defining deviancy down." Moynihan said "the amount of deviant
behavior in American society has increased beyond the levels the community
can afford to recognize," so we are "redefining deviancy so as to exempt
much conduct previously stigmatized and ... raising the 'normal' level
in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Similarly, the Clinton administration has increased deviant
presidential behavior beyond what the community can afford to recognize,
so the liberal left is in the process of defining presidential deviancy
down. Feminists, artists, writers, <i>New York Times</i> columnist Anthony
Lewis -- all enamored of President Clinton and his policies -- recently
have told us that nothing close to impeachable conduct has occurred in
the Lewinsky perjury/obstruction-of-justice matter, so we should forget
the whole thing. Thus they are defining the presidency and its moral authority
down.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Not much of a leg to stand on</font></font></b>
<p><font size=+0>The feminists' disregard for the good of the nation is
at least explainable, for they are a small interest group bought and paid
for by the president's support on a policy issue (abortion). An iron rule
of politics is that when you are bought and paid for, you are loyal to
the end, so they support their "ally in the White House."</font>
<p><font size=+0>The literati and Lewis have no such cover and so have
set an even more destructive standard. In their September 24 statement
the intellectuals, led by the former French culture minister Jack Lang
conclude that "A statesman is answerable to public opinion or to the law
only for his public acts. All else is solely a matter of his own conscience."</font>
<p><font size=+0>In other words, a president on his own time may commit
any acts he chooses, illegal as well as legal, and not be held accountable.
He may kite checks, run red lights and injure people in the resulting crash,
or falsify financial documents, and because he is not acting in his public
capacity as president, he is both blameless (his transgressions are a "matter
of his own conscience") and unaccountable (not "answerable to ... the law").
A curious standard indeed. Now we can see what Bill Buckley meant when
he said he would rather be governed by 100 people selected at random from
the Boston phone directory than by the faculty of Harvard University.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In his Sept. 23 column, Lewis states a different absolute:
"Sex and lying about it are not grounds for impeachment." No citations
are given for the legal basis of this conclusion, but let us accept it
at face value for the moment.</font>
<p><font size=+0>That there are serious and principled thinkers on the
other side bothers him not at all. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe
of Harvard Law School says the standard is whether the conduct, "if clearly
proved, fatally undermines our ability to trust the only official elected
to lead the entire nation -- the distinguishing feature of an <i>impeachable</i>,
as opposed to an ordinary, offense." Andrew Sullivan of the <i>New Republic</i>
writes that "it doesn't matter what the lie is about. What matters is that
it is premeditated and clearly proven." Doris and Richard Goodwin believe
that "the base campaign the president began on Jan. 21 clearly constitutes
an abuse of presidential authority, a deliberate decision to use the precious
platform of the presidency ... to present a false picture to the American
public."</font>
<p><font size=+0>In the Sept. 24 <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, Yale Law School
Professor George L. Priest argues that the correct standard is different:
The issue is why the president lied. The lies in Clinton's case, Priest
writes, "are not about sex or personal privacy. Rather, they are intended
to influence a material witness, Monica Lewinsky, to sign a false affidavit
denying a sexual relationship so that the president can in his deposition
credibly deny a sexual relationship."</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>Is anything impeachable?</font></font></b>
<p><font size=+0>But the Anthony Lewis position raises a basic question:
If sex and lying about it are not grounds for impeachment, is there <i>any</i>
conduct a president may engage in and then lie about that is an impeachable
offense? For example:</font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font size=+0>Raising, in the White House, foreign contributions for a
re-election campaign. It is against the law but is private conduct, so
is lying about it under oath not impeachable?</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Filing an intentionally false income-tax return and denying
it under oath. Again, private conduct, so are the intellectuals correct
that the president cannot be held accountable?</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>An automobile accident in which the president is driving;
the car crashes; his companion is killed. He lies under oath to cover up
the death and ensure that no charges are brought. Impeachable?</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>Long before he was elected, a president is involved in a
barroom brawl and the physical beating of a person of another race. Money
changes hands, no charges are brought and the matter is hushed up. Years
later the incident becomes public, is verified, and the president denies
under oath that it ever happened.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+0>The president fathers a child out of wedlock and pays the
mother large sums not to disclose the matter. The child is discovered,
and the president denies the paternity and the payments under oath.</font></li>
</blockquote>
<font size=+0>All five of these examples are private conduct. The first
two are illegal; the second two might be, but no charges were filed. The
first three acts were contemporaneous with the presidency; the last two
were not.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Liberal artists and writers would say that none of these
actions by a president are impeachable. Lewis likely would say that the
last two are not impeachable because the conduct is not illegal and that
the false tax return was not either because the House Judiciary Committee
voted such a charge down in the Watergate matter. He also might argue that
accepting foreign campaign contributions was wrong and illegal but not
central to the presidency and so not impeachable either.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+0>End the double standard</font></font></b>
<p><font size=+0>By pursuing these lines of reasoning, Lewis and his liberal
left followers are defining the office of the presidency down, lowering
its standard of conduct and the people's expectations of it and, in Tribe's
words, "undermin[ing] our ability to trust the only official elected to
lead the entire nation."</font>
<p><font size=+0>The ordinary citizen would say that there cannot be two
standards, one for us and one for the president, and that perjury -- lying
about things under oath -- is illegal, wrong and thus impeachable, regardless
of what is lied about. He or she would be elevating the standards of the
presidency up rather than defining them down.</font>
<p><font size=+0>But by saying none of this matters, that the president
has suffered enough and we should move on, the liberal establishment is
moving in the opposite direction. That leads to the final question: What
are the consequences for the institution of the presidency if Clinton's
transgressions are forgiven, accepted as the norm for future presidents
and we move on?</font>
