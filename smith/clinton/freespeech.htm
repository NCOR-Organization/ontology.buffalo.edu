 <br><font size=+0><p><h2>Ad Nauseum</h2>

<p>Many Americans find themselves shocked by what television executives permit on the air these days. But they might be even more shocked to find
what remains forbidden. Just ask Gary Bauer, president of American Renewal. When Mr. Bauer tried to buy Washington air time for a television  ad calling on Bill Clinton to resign, no one would touch it.</p>
<p>In itself this is no indictment of free speech. After all, the foundation upon which a free press rests is the idea that each newspaper, radio or television station should be arbiter of what will appear under its banner, whether it be news or advertising. Where we part company is with the hypocrisy of stations that parade their "objectivity," yet apply one
standard to liberals and another to conservatives.</p>
<p>This glaring double standard was thrown into high relief by the different treatment accorded two advertisements dealing with the Clinton scandal: the anti-Clinton ad produced by the conservative American Renewal, and the pro-Clinton ad produced by its liberal rival, People for the
American Way. When American Renewal approached four Washington
stations--the affiliates of ABC, NBC and CBS, as well as the local CNN station, TCI/District Cablevision--they all shot down the ad. Two of those stations, the NBC and CBS affiliates, also rejected the People for the American Way ad. But the local CNN outlet rejected Mr. Bauer even though
People for the American Way's ad has already run on CNN nationally. Most glaring, the ABC affiliate, WJLA, ran with the People For ad while turning American Renewal down cold.</p>
<p>We note too that while People for the American Way has released a statement of support on behalf of the "brave decision" by the Manhattan Theatre Club's decision to produce "Corpus Christi"--a play about a gay Jesus who has sex with his apostles--the guns fall remarkably still when it comes to the speech of groups such as Mr. Bauer's.</p>
<p>With regard to the pro- and anti-Clinton spots now at issue, we've seen
them both and can confirm that neither have anything near the kind of stuff
you might see in any 10 minutes of, say, an episode of "Friends." The
People For spot features the group's president, Carole Shields, with her
grandson, asking viewers if they are "fed up with Jesse Helms, Ken Starr,
and all their allies." If you don't vote, she warns, you'll be giving power
to extremists. "Tell Starr &amp; Co, 'It's time for America to move on,' "
she concludes.</p>
<p>Mr. Bauer's ad is similarly tame. It begins with a TV screen showing the
now-infamous clip of Mr. Clinton denying sex with Monica Lewinsky. Then the
camera pans back as other voices start discussing aspects of the case. "Who
cares if everyone lies?" asks one. Eventually it emerges that the people
watching are children, at which point Mr. Bauer comes on and urges
President Clinton "to put our country and our children first" by
resigning.</p>
<p>Hardly fire-breathing stuff. Yet what makes it even more ironic is that
both PAW and American Renewal say that the only place they've had trouble
getting things on the air is in Washington. Such troubles point to a
disturbing inclination to guarantee "fairness" in politics with even more
mindless regulation. The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, for
example, included a provision that would limit ads that mention candidates
in the last 60 days of the race. More broadly the homogenization of
political speech includes restrictions on political donations, which helps
explain why only about a quarter of the Congressional seats up for
re-election this year have a competitive race.</p>
<p>We find it curious that at a time when broadcast television can make
room for Howard Stern obsessing about the size of this or that organ,
stations should be so squeamish about politics.</p>

 People for the American Way is primarily a Jewish organization. <br>

 Gary Bauer promised that those stations refusing to air his ad while agreeing to run the pro Clinton ads would be hearing from his lawyer. I hope he follows up on that. <br>
