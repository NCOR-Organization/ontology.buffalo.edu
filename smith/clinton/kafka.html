<font size=+1><b>Klinton and Kafka</b></font><p>
<b> The Washington Post</b><br><b>1.19.99</b>
 <em>Richard Cohen</em>
 <br><font size=+0><p>"I feel like a character in a novel," Bill Clinton told his aide, Sidney
                  Blumenthal, almost a year ago. The novel he cited was Arthur Koestler's
                  "Darkness at Noon" about the Moscow show trials of the 1930s. The
                  parallels are obvious, if not disingenuous. Clinton's problem is not that he is
                  being framed. It is that he's guilty.<P>

                  But of what? For that answer we have to turn to the novel Clinton should
                  have cited, the one I think is the most important of the 20th century: Franz
                  Kafka's "The Trial." Its original German title is "Der Prozess." It suggests,
                  as Cynthia Ozick wrote in a recent New Yorker, "something ongoing,
                  evolving, unfolding, driven on by its own forward movement -- a process
                  and a passage." In other words, an impeachment trial.<P>

                  In my mind, Clinton is Joseph K., who, in the first sentence of "The Trial,"
                  is arrested "without having done anything wrong" or, in another translation,
                  "without having done anything truly wrong." I prefer the latter because it
                  comes closest to what I think Clinton believes and, in a sense, what I do,
                  too: It was wrong to have sex with Monica Lewinsky, and it was wrong to
                  lie about it, but it was not "truly" wrong -- like abusing presidential power
                  by covering up a burglary (Nixon) or adamantly refusing to administer the
                  law (Johnson). Here the word "truly" takes on a contemporary meaning. It
                  stands for "impeachable."<P>

                  "The Trial" is not merely about the framing of an innocent man. It is about
                  process. Kafka understood process because by day he worked for the
                  Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute -- a private insurance company, a
                  dense bureaucracy, where process was everything. Kafka's literary
                  imagination was the product of many things -- a German speaker in
                  Czech-speaking Bohemia, a Jew among gentiles -- but no one should
                  overlook what the man did for a living. He toiled in workmen's comp.<P>

                  And so Kafka knew about process. He would have known that the
                  November elections would not have ended the threat to Clinton. Congress
                  believes in process. It is the creature of process. Process is everything, and
                  once it's begun it continues until its conclusion because that, after all, is the
                  process.<P>

                  In the process of impeachment, the vaunted middle ground collapses.
                  Moderate Republicans in the House were not given the option of a
                  compromise. It was yea or nay, up or down. So said the process. It will be
                  the same, probably, in the Senate for the trial.<P>

                  The president is in maximum jeopardy. Kafka would know that. The
                  process is devouring him. It proceeds regardless of the public mood, not
                  despite it, as some would have it. The process requires witnesses, and it is
                  more and more likely some will be called. When that happens, Clinton's
                  case will be hurt even more.<P>

                  Monica Lewinsky says she was never told to lie, never promised a job, in
                  exchange for silence. Yes. But in her deposition and in her testimony, she
                  will be asked to explain, expand: Did she and Clinton ever talk about
                  lying? What was understood? What was expected? Black and white will
                  slur into gray, "no" will become "maybe." The process is a form of
                  alchemy. It can turn steel into fudge.<P>

                  Still, Clinton is not the perfect Kafka protagonist. To be that, he must
                  come to believe in his own guilt. He must come to believe that he has to be
                  guilty, otherwise he would not be accused. This realization, which Clinton
                  has fought so tenaciously, will ultimately come packaged as a compromise
                  -- the show trial confession in exchange for leniency (censure) -- if
                  conviction seems likely.<P>

                  But as Kafka would know, that's too late. By then, the process will insist
                  on an up-or-down vote on conviction: guilty or not. Some senators will
                  explain that since the offenses do not warrant the removal of a president,
                  they will vote nay. But others might come to realize that the process has
                  boxed them in: Is Clinton guilty or is he not?<P>

                  "Logic" is another term Kafka used. You may prefer "law." It is about the
                  same. "Logic is doubtless unshakable, but it cannot withstand a man who
                  wants to go on living," Joseph K. says at the very end of "The Trial." One
                  paragraph later, logic, the process, has won. K. is being executed, stabbed
                  in the heart, watching his own death "with failing eyes" as others --
                  someone at a window, his killers, maybe mankind itself -- watched also.<P>

                  "It was as if the shame of it must outlive him," Kafka wrote.<P>

                  He was right about that, too. </p></font><hr> <p><font size=+0><I>The Trial</I> being one of my favorite novels, I see even more parallels to be drawn to present-day America.  Creeping, smiling totalitarianism chief among them.</font></p>

 From Chapter Two, <I>First Interrogation
<br><br>
K. made up his mind to observe rather than speak, consequently he offered no defense of his alleged lateness in arriving and merely said:  "Whether I am late or not, I am here now."  A burst of applause followed, once more from the right side of the hall.  "These people are easy to win over," thought K., disturbed only by the silence in the left half of the room, which lay just behind him and from which only one or two isolated handclaps had come.  He considereed what he should say to win over the whole of the audience once and for all, or if that were not possible, at least to win over most of them for the time being.</I>

<P>
Monica testified at length that she and Clinton did have understanding that both would deny the affair.  In other words, they would both lie, even if they didn't use the word "lie" to each other.  Did you miss that, Mr. Cohen?<br>

It is the story of a man who lived in the world and to him the world looked one way for a long time and then it looked 
another and very different way. The change did not happen all at once. Many things happened, and that man did not know when he had any responsibility for them and when he did not. There was, in fact, a time when he came to believe 
that nobody had any responsibility for anything and there was no god but the Great Twitch.

Perhaps if the camera zoomed in on that bible Clinton carries leaving church, we might see that it is really the  Great Twitch Gospel?<br>

 <I>The Trial</I> is a fine novel. Its relationship to Clinton is
exactly zero. He hasn't done anything truly wrong?! Just 
multiple felonies. (And of course, lest we forget, that's 
just in the Lewisky case.) The only thing Kafkaesque about 
the situation is that Clinton himself continues to truly 
believe that he's innocent.<br>

 I just read Cohen's column while cruising the Washington Post site, and copied it, intending to post it.  A search for "Kafka" turned up this post.  I'm tempted to re-post it under a new headline (I won't):<p>

"A Liberal Comes to it in His Own Tortured Way:  'Clinton's Guilty and Will Be Removed'"<p>

Yes, Cohen is exasperatingly postmodern in his analysis of the Clinton situation.  But he's got one thing exactly right, whatever his choice of metaphors:  the "process" (i.e., the law) has started and it will grind on until the end.  That end, given the law's processes, is very likely to be Clinton's conviction and removal.<p>

If not, it will mean a revolutionary flouting of the law.<br>

 Excellent post, witness. Russian/Soviet literature sure goes a long way toward explaining the mindset and machinations of the New Left (as Horowitz has described them). They may be "New" but their characteristics are often spitting images of the characters of the old Left.<p>
