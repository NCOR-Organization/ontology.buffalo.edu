 <br><font size=+0><p>THE MOB PRESIDENT <p>
 
The Mob Helped Clinton get Started In Politics.<p>  
It is Now Helping Him Escape the Law <p>  


When young Bill Clinton in 1974 made his first run for political office, a crucial $10,000 loan was arranged for him by his
uncle, Raymond Clinton. Uncle Raymond has been tied by Clinton biographer Roger Morris to the Hot Springs Mafia.  <p>

But it was not until 1984, when Clinton was elected for a second term as Governor of Arkansas, that Mob money really
started pouring in. "That was the election when the Mob really came into Arkansas politics, the dog-track and racetrack
boys, the payoff people who saw a good thing," a former U.S. Attorney told Roger Morris. "It wasn't just Bill Clinton and it
went beyond our old Dixie Mafia, which was penny-ante by comparison. This was eastern and and West Coast crime money
that noticed the possibilities just like the legitimate corporations did." <p>

Among the "legitimate corporations" that noticed the possibilities with the rapidly ascending governor thirsting for power
and money were front corporations for the intelligence services of the People's Republic of China. The Lippo empire came
to Arkansas that year. <p>

By then, Bill Clinton's ties to organized crime had become well- known. His half-brother Roger Clinton was convicted of
cocaine distribution in association with Mob figure and Clinton money man Dan Lasater. <p>

In the years that followed, Arkansas became a major cocaine trans-shipment point for the Mafia, crossing paths with the
famous CIA Contra resupply operation at Mena. <p>

Bill Clinton had found a most successful formula in U.S. politics: financial backing from a coalition of organized crime and
hostile foreign governments. <p>

A MERGER OF THE DIXIE, CHICAGO AND NEW YORK CRIME FAMILIES <p>

So successful was this formula, that in 1992 Bill Clinton used it to reach the highest office, the office of the U.S. Presidency.
In return for large campaign donations, the crime families would be represented in the Clinton administration. The New York
Mob paid $56 million [1] and won the slot of Deputy Chief of Staff for its lawyer Harold Ickes. The Dixie Mafia paid an
undisclosed amount and obtained slots for Patsy Thomasson and Buddy Young. The Chicago political machine sent Rahm
Emanuel and David Wilhelm. <p>

Harold Ickes proved his value to the Mob when he held his hand over Mob puppets Arthur Coia and Ron Carey who were
under separate RICO investigations by the Justice Department. Patsy Thomasson, in charge of White House drug testing
policy, saw to it that criminal figures on the White House staff would not be bothered about past and current drug use. <p>

The People's Republic of China, in return for at least a $3 million loan through Worthen Bank, won a slot for its spy John
Huang at the Commerce Department. Later followed access to advanced U.S. military technology, access to the Long Beach
Naval Base, MFN trade status, and more campaign contributions. <p>

Peripheral Mob figures Nathan Landow, Richard Ben-Veniste, and their associates Terry Lenzner and Paul Begala became
part of the secret police that would keep Clinton in office despite multiple revelations of criminal offenses. Ironically, the
only member of the Clinton enforcement team who has threatened the use of Mafia methods in public is James Carville. He
said on television that Kenneth Starr was just one mistake away from not having any kneecaps. "Kneecapping" is a Mafia
specialty. Yet the only link between Carville and the Mafia that we have been able to find so far is his partnership with Paul
Begala, who admitted in a recent deposition for the Filegate trial that he was in close and frequent contact with his friend
Richard Ben-Veniste, a Mob lawyer and friend of Mobster Alvin Malnik [2]. Richard Ben- Veniste has defended several
drug traffickers and money launderers for the Mafia and for the DNC. Ben-Veniste also defended Bill Clinton on the Senate
Whitewater panel in 1995. <p>

It goes without saying that a Racketeering-Influenced Corrupt Organization such as the Clinton administration cannot stay in
office long without a very efficient "enforcement" component to its secret police. The methods employed by this
"enforcement" team include murder. The 1993 assassination of Clinton private investigator Jerry Parks was carried out by
people in Hot Springs associated with Buddy Young [3]. Of all the mysterious deaths and suicides surrounding the Clinton
Secret Police, this is the only one that has been solved. That does not mean that it has been prosecuted, though, for corruption
of the judicial system is another necessary component of survival. White House Director of Administration, Patsy
Thomasson of the Dixie Mafia, has been implicated in several attempts on the life of Dennis Patrick, a former money
launderer for the Dixie Mafia who wanted out [3]. <p>

CORRUPTING THE PRESS <p>

Survival of the Clinton administration has also been contingent upon successful corruption of the press. The most prominent
Clinton operator at this time is Murray Waas, gaining fame in the mainstream media for finding a psychic in Arkansas whose
son had seen money given to Whitewater witness David Hale. <p>

Murray Waas has actually been doing opposition research for the Clinton administration for several years. His journalistic
"scoops" (or are they merely ventilations of White House FBI files?) include research into the background of Kenneth Starr
and into the background of Clinton critics. In this research, his Mafia-style methods have become apparent. Waas threatened
to have reporter Michael Lewis killed after Lewis wrote a New Republic story looking into murder and drugs in
Arkansas--a story that was unflattering of Waas [4]. Who does Waas know who would be able to enforce such a threat? <p>

THE MISSING PIECE <p>

If China made illegal donations to the Clinton campaign in return for mercantile and military strategic advantages, then what
illegal donations have been made by Russia? The favors Clinton has made towards China pale in comparison to the favors
he has made towards Russia. Billions of dollars in economic support and the maintenance of a strategic advantage in favor of
Russia through the obstruction and delay of modernization of the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal and the development and
deployment of a U.S. national missile defense. <p>

Lest gestures as these be interpreted as prudent engagement of a fledgling democracy, one should consider that it has rarely
been the democratic forces in Russia, or the Russian people, that have been the beneficiaries of Clinton administration
support: <p>

(1) Clinton's point man on Russia policy is the former KGB's point man on propaganda in the U.S. His name is Strobe
Talbott, a former editor at Time magazine who built his career on access to KGB officials and their Soviet propaganda [5]. <p>

(2) The Clinton administration has worked hand-in-hand with Russian Mobsters to illegally extradite whistleblowers who
have revealed massive KGB-Mafia corruption in Russia [6]. <p>

(3) The FBI, through its new offices in Moscow, has become an adjunct of the corrupt KGB-Mafia bureaucracy that rules
Russian society today. FBI Director Freeh has reversed himself in stating that the Russian Mafia does not pose a threat to
U.S. domestic or national security [7]. Only a month earlier, Freeh had warned that 30 Russian Mafia syndicates were
conducting the most sophisticated criminal operations ever seen in America based on their access to expertise in computer
technology, encryption techniques and money laundering [8]. <p>

(4) Monetary aid to Russia has been diverted towards the modernization of its strategic nuclear arsenal, including a new
generation of nuclear attack submarines. Other funds have been diverted to the Russian Mob <p>

(5) The engineer of these scams is Strobe Talbott. <p>

Where are the records of illegal campaign donations invested by the Russian KGB-Mafia complex in the Clinton
administration to maintain this profitable state of affairs? Apart from the revelation of a $90,000 donation to the DNC on
behalf of suspected nuclear arms dealer Grigory Loutchansky [9], the record of this cash pipeline must be hidden inside the
DNC's closely guarded campaign finance records. That is a scandal yet to surface. <p>

THE CLINTON LEGACY <p>

The legacy of the Clinton Presidency is the transformation of the United States into a narco republic with parts of the judicial
system as corrupt as that of Colombia. Much worse than that, Bill Clinton has helped build a state-of-the-art offensive
nuclear strike capability in the most dangerous nations on earth: China, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran. And the nuclear weapons
of China and perhaps Russia are targeted at the U.S. Simultaneously with this build-up, Clinton has dismantled, defunded,
and starved the U.S. military so that today we have a "hollow army." <p>

The actions of President Clinton will dramatically affect the security of the United States for generations to come. He has
sold out his own country in order to win and maintain the Presidency. <p>
