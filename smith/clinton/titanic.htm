    <p>As the latest &quot;bimbo eruption&quot; breaks over America's airways, and a liberal
    media reviews the crisis, one observation remains stunningly absent from their
    assessments: The way in which this series of events signifies the end of feminism as we
    know it. The one thing established beyond the shadow of a doubt by the line of women outed
    by the Paula Jones suit is that every feminist in America -- with the notable exception of
    Camille Paglia -- has been exposed as a hypocrite and a phony.</p>
    <p>The once shrill voice of feminist outrage is suddenly, deafeningly still. What we hear
    instead from the chorus on the left is a litany that goes something like this. What Bill
    Clinton does in his sex life should not be the subject of public concern. Or, as <i>Politically
    Incorrect</i>'s Bill Maher summed up the reaction: &quot;Where's the crime?&quot; Clinton
    is running the important business of the ship of state. Who should care about his private
    acts? (As though these latest incidents of alleged sexual predation did not take place in
    the Oval Office, in the seat of government, in the presidential <i>workplace</i> -- and as
    though it was not visited on the President's <i>employees</i>.)</p>
    <p>Better feminists should ask, what happened to all their previous concern about sexual
    harrassment? Where is their outrage over the abuse of women in government offices? In the <i>White
    House</i>! For what place could be more symbolically important to an issue affecting every
    working woman in America?</p>
    <p>Have feminists forgotten their crusade against Clarence Thomas? Here was a man with 20
    years of unblemished public service and no history (unlike Clinton) of sexual malfeasance,
    who only five years ago was publicly burned in a feminist witch-hunt. And for what? Not
    certainly for allegations that he dropped his pants and told a female employee to
    &quot;kiss it.&quot; Nor for allegedly seducing a 21-year-old summer intern and then
    encouraging her to lie to cover up the crime. Oh innocent times those! Thomas was
    subjected to public humiliation and came within an inch of losing a Supreme Court seat for
    the heinous sins of 1) allegedly mentioning a porn star named Long Dong Silver; 2)
    allegedly making a joke about a pubic hair on an office coke can; and 3) allegedly giving
    verbal signals that vaguely made -- not a wet-behind-the-ears intern but -- a civil rights
    <i>attorney</i> in his employ feel uncomfortable on the job! Such abominable acts did
    these yet unproven allegations portend, that righteous feminists still froth at the mere
    utterance of Thomas' name.</p>
    <p>Yet here is not one wronged woman but four actively claiming abuse by a sitting
    president (who is familiarly referred to in taped conversations between them as &quot;the
    Big Creep&quot;). Here is not a ten-year old memory witnessed by no one, but episodes
    immediately reported. Here are jobs actually terminated after the fact. The no longer
    employed Kathleen Willey was observed by Linda Tripp exiting the Oval Office with lipstick
    smeared, and blouse undone after the act. Here, moreover, is not just an alleged crime but
    also an alleged attempt to cover-up the crime. By her own testimony, Anita Hill regarded
    Clarence Thomas even after the supposed incidents as a friend and mentor to whom she could
    turn for advice, recommendations, and career advancements. These -- also by her own
    testimony -- were not attempts to shut her up but rather to offer her support.</p>
    <p>By contrast, here we have the transfer of two women to get them out of the way and the
    subsequent bullying of Linda Tripp by presidential counsel Bob Bennett, who called her a
    &quot;liar&quot; for complaining about the abuse. It was this insensitive moment according
    to Tripp that led to her decision to expose the whole mess. Here, we have a sitting
    president taking advantage not of a well-connected Ivy League lawyer but of a 22-year old
    intern named Monica Lewinsky, first allegedly seduced and then brutally discarded. But not
    before being used to deliver a hush memo to the victim-witness. This act of presidential <i>lese
    majeste</i> involved the young woman (who probably had no idea what she was doing) in a
    felony in the making. Talk about an employer taking advantage!</p>
    <p>Lewinsky's attorney now says his client's life has been &quot;ravaged&quot; by the
    events that have taken place. Who, pray tell, might have ravaged her? Who could have
    violated his trust as employer, as powerful public icon dealing with a young and
    impressionable employee? Who most likely did ensare her in a felony by sending her on the
    mission to Tripp? Where is the feminist outrage over <i>this</i> abominable treatment of
    the female gender?</p>
    <p>And of course, the trashing of Paula Jones -- the root cause of these latest events --
    by Clinton's cohorts Bennett and Carville is now six months in duration, with no protest
    yet from the feminist side. Consider the infamous figure of Arlen Specter who, despite
    public apologies and self-flagellations, is still ritually hung out to dry by the feminist
    truth squad whenever and wherever he happens to appear. Let no one forget his unspeakable
    acts against Ms. Hill! And what were these? His &quot;harsh&quot; cross-examination of the
    sensitive witness to demonstrate that she had perjured herself in her testimony against
    Clarence Thomas. Hill was no passive victim, recall, but the armed aggressor attempting to
    destroy the character and career of a public servant. As an arbiter of the facts, it was
    Specter's <i>duty</i> to examine her accusations with such rigor. Yet abject as his
    unnecessary contrition has been, pure as his regret, the relentless feminist vanguard
    refuses to forgive him. But has one of these keepers of the flame come out to defend Paula
    Jones, or to publicly berate Bennett and Carville for tarring the victim because she dared
    to stand up?</p>
    <p>After such virtuoso hypocrisy, who can take feminists seriously any more? In the end,
    their concern is evidently not women at all, but their own left-wing political agendas.
    Only conservatives, it appears, can be sexual harassers. As for liberals, like Ted Kennedy
    and Bill Clinton, as far feminists are concerned they can have their way with women -- any
    way they want. They can screw them, abandon them, ruin them, ravage them and even drown
    them, and feminists will look past the misfeasance and will fight to keep them in power.
    And they will do so in the current matter with Hillary Clinton -- the classic abused
    spouse -- posing as feminist heroine, and leading the way with lies to protect the guilty.</p>
