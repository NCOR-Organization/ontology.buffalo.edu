<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><font face="times"><font color="#666666"><font size=-1>DO WE REALLY
WANT A SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED PRESIDENT -- OR IS THE CLINTON SCANDAL AN OPPORTUNITY
TO REDEFINE THE TYRANNICAL INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE?</font></font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font color="#669999"><font size=+0>BY FRED BRANFMAN</font></font><font size=+1>
| </font><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>L</font></font><font size=+1>et's
try a thought-experiment. Is it in the national interest to have a satisfied,
relaxed, loose president making decisions as to whether and how to bomb
Iraq? Or do we prefer a frustrated, irritable, snappish commander-in-chief
determining who will live and who will die?</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>Is our nation best served by a chief
executive who regularly engages in towering fits that reduce his aides
to cowering children because of sexually frustrating nights spent in the
presidential boudoir? Or are we and the president's hard-pressed staff
better off if the chief's sexual needs are better met, even if that means
allowing him more sexual freedom than most of us who live lives of quiet
desperation?</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>It is curious how little examination
has been given to the real issue underlying the Clinton sex scandal --
how to remain faithful to a loved spouse when it so often requires a lifetime
of sexual frustration. One wonders how useful it is to force people into
this Procrustean bed where millions either give up satisfying sex or cheat
and lie in order to stay married to the one they love.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>I happened to be directing presidential
candidate Gary Hart's think tank in 1984 when Donna Rice came into our
lives and such questions first had such a profound effect on the nation's
politics. What struck me most at the time was that Hart had both behaved
badly and that he had been driven to it for a decent reason: an unwillingness
to leave his wife.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>His friend Jack Nicholson's observation
of Hart's behavior at the time -- "Gary likes to fuck" -- provided only
a partial explanation. Hart also felt a real love and/or old-fashioned
loyalty toward his wife, or at least that's what sources close to them
told me. Faced with living a life of sexual frustration or leaving the
wife he loved, he tried to find a compromise both could live with. But,
in the glare of publicity, he failed.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>This dilemma bedevils millions of Americans
of both sexes, but the president has raised it to a new level of awareness.
If he does survive in the White House for the next three years, it is difficult
to imagine that even he will be enjoying the kind of sexual release he
has been accustomed to (assuming Monica Lewinsky's alleged allegations
have some truth to them).</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>In that case, America may be led by
a president, possibly the first in the nation's history, who is denied
the kind of release he craves to help soothe the tensions of his office.
It's hard to believe that's good for the nation, however much it may satisfy
those who want our man to be punished for his sins, or to provide a "role
model" so that millions of young people can grow up to face the same frustration.</font></font>
<p><font face="times"><font size=+1>The world of the married is divided
into three basic groups:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="times"><font size=+1>The few who are able over the years to
experience sustained sexual pleasure with each other;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="times"><font size=+1>A larger number who accept the absence
of long-term sexual satisfaction in return for other benefits, such as
children, companionship, security, non-sexual love;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="times"><font size=+1>Those with high sex drives who have periodic
relations with partners outside of marriage -- often lying about it to
their spouses -- who also happen often to be among the more high-achieving
and successful of the population.</font></font></li>
</blockquote>
<font face="times"><font size=+1>Clinton, by all accounts, belongs in the
last category, as do many of our senior politicians, including recent presidential
candidates, as well as artists, business leaders and journalists (including
those who apparently see no contradiction in criticizing the president
for the same infidelity they have engaged in). And this is not just a guy
thing: Polls indicate that almost as many women as men experience sexual
frustration in marriage, and act out accordingly.</font></font>
