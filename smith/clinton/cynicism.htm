<p><font size=+0>The recollection may fade, as many important people must
hope it already has, but who can forget that moment on August 17 when seven
whole months of a presidential year went straight through the looking glass?
With Clinton&rsquo;s grudging, resentful, surly, and hectoring "address" to the
nation, which contained at least the bogus and counterfeit elements of
an admission and an apology, an entire exhausting thesaurus of excuses
and alibis turned into its mirror image. Judge Starr&rsquo;s investigation protracted
too long? After half a year of presidential prevarication, that one went
into the memory hole with humiliating velocity. Indeed, only a few days
later, Clinton&rsquo;s lawyers and Hill partisans were bleating loudly at the
indecent speed with which the independent counsel was presenting his findings
to Congress. Judge Starr&rsquo;s labors too costly? That unworthy mantra--it
is not for the president as chief magistrate to complain about the cost
of judicial proceedings--died away as the independent counsel presented
a $44 million bill for the months wasted by Clintonian lying (and as a
shower of ruinously expensive and hastily launched cruise missiles fell
on the wrong targets in Sudan and Afghanistan). Let&rsquo;s get this thing behind
us and "move on"? That standby sound bite became harder to utter as it
became clear that the swiftest route to a new beginning would be a corny
and lip-biting speech of resignation. "It&rsquo;s a private matter." Well, then,
who claims the Oval Office as private space? "Why all this fuss about sex?"
But the president says it wasn&rsquo;t sex. Let&rsquo;s get on with the agenda." Excuse
me--what f*cking agenda? Clinton hasn&rsquo;t had a press conference, except
when hiding behind embarrassed foreign statesmen, since April, hasn&rsquo;t been
to anything much but fund-raisers on the domestic front, and on the international
scene has sleepwalked through several major crises. Even if you think the
original offense was nugatory, and the cover-up no more than venal, Clinton&rsquo;s
conduct since the original exposure has been hideous, and has revealed
to us a very nasty and shady politician.</font>
<p><font size=+0>So, alter the moral and political disaster of August 17
a whole new set of jawbreaking private and public contrivances had to be
deployed, at public expense, by demoralized and frazzled subordinates.
And these fresh excuses all turned clumsily on language and meaning: the
indispensable common coin of democratic discourse. Looking and sounding--and
perhaps even feeling--like idiots, the president&rsquo;s men fanned out to say
that ejaculation in the mouth is not what ordinary and "normal" Americans
consider to be sexual, that lying under oath is not exactly perjury, and
that terms like "alone" and "is" represent postmodern conundrums of signification.
Any child of average intelligence knows what is going on here. It&rsquo;s <i>Through
the Looking-Glass</i> for real:</font>

make words mean so many different things."</font>
