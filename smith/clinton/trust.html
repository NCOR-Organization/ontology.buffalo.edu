<p><b><font size=+1>The Three Questions</font></b>

<p><font size=+0>By A.M. ROSENTHAL The Three Questions WASHINGTON -- President
Clinton has forced the members of Congress to face three questions, whether
or not the American people will like the answers:</font>
<p><font size=+0>Two of them have already been answered. Like most Americans
I have been struggling with my own answer to the third question, or was
fleeing it.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The first question: Is Mr. Clinton fit to remain President?
There may be reasons that Congress considers important enough to allow
him to serve out his term -- but fit, no.</font>
<p><font size=+0>A man who risks the Presidency of the U.S., its moral
and political worth in American life, the confidence of the people in it,
its very ability to function under his direction, all to satisfy himself
sexually for the moment, is not stable enough within himself to be entrusted
with America.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Perhaps we would all lie to save ourselves from deep sexual
embarrassment and trouble. But if we did so under oath and then lied again
and again about it, we would know we would have to do more to escape jail
than tell the judge we were real sorry.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Still, if this were his first lie . But it isn't. He has
lied so often that it has become another sign of a broken rudder.</font>
<p><font size=+0>He lied during the Presidential campaign -- the draft
notice matter. Then he went on to lie to the American people about their
own national interests -- how he would fight for human rights against the
Communist Chinese dictatorship, how Saddam Hussein was complying with U.N.
inspections at the very time Iraq was preparing to end inspection, whether
high-tech missile sales to Beijing could compromise U.S. security.</font>
<p><b><font size=+0>Jesse Jackson said in 1992: "I can maybe work with
him but I know now who he is, what he is. There is nothing this man won't
do. He is immune to shame. Move past all the nice posturing and get really
down in there in him, you find absolutely nothing ..... nothing but an
appetite."</font></b>
<p><font size=+0>Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat, was a bit gentler:
"Clinton's an unusually good liar, unusually good."</font>
<p><font size=+0>Both quotes come from William J. Bennett's solidly valuable
new book, "The Death of Outrage -- Bill Clinton and the Assault on American
Ideals" (The Free Press). Read it, particularly if you are sure you won't
agree.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Second question: Has Mr. Clinton's risk-taking already
so deeply damaged the Presidency that it cannot be repaired while he is
in office?</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;This week I heard him give a speech at the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York about the world's economic crisis and
how "it is time for us to rise to our responsibility."</font>
<p><font size=+0>I thought: You call on us to rise to our responsibility?
Other members told me they had the same thought. One just snickered and
made a dirty joke out of the sentence. The military cashiers or imprisons
members who commit adultery, particularly with subordinates. How in decency
will William Clinton take the salute from the men and women he commands
while he whines not to be punished for the same offense, repeated and repeated?</font>
<p><font size=+0>Millions of Americans still want him in office. That does
not change the truth that he has made the Presidency a bottle of cynical
poison for many of us and a dirty joke for the country. Damage enough.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Third: How do we repair the damage as best we can?</font>
<p><font size=+0>A motion of Congressional censure would endorse Mr. Clinton's
definition of responsibility. Take the chance whatever the risk. If caught,
plead for compassion. If handed an act of censure, bite your lip in sorrow.
Then when you pass the troops in parade keep a straight face.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The final choice, impeachment by the House of Representatives
and a removal trial by the Senate -- that's frightening to most of us.</font>
<p><font size=+0>For about two years, a new President would be in office
while Russia fell apart, Saddam incited war and terrorists scouted America.
How strong would he be?</font>
<p><font size=+0>We do not know if Al Gore would be any better in office
than Mr. Clinton. But then we never do know about a Vice President who
becomes President, do we? Maybe he will stop echoing Mr. Clinton's apologies
and evasions. Maybe he will be Truman!</font>
<p><font size=+0>But we would know that under the Constitution we removed
an unfit man who risked and soiled the Presidency while shaming himself
personally . And we will have given Bill Clinton what he needs most --
the choice in private life to keep rock-ing in waves of his own making
or recover the stability he has so long lost.</font><font size=+0></font>
