<h2>Role of Bruised Clinton Changes on World Stage</h2><p>
<img src="http://graphics.nytimes.com/images/w.gif" align=left alt=W>ASHINGTON  --  With President Clinton distracted and besieged and
his moral authority questioned after an affair with Monica
Lewinsky, there is much room for America's allies, its Congress and
even its energy companies to ignore, deflect or defy his will.
<p>   The president has been forced to drag NATO closer and closer to
the brink of bombing Serbia, an outcome no one wants, to have
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia take Washington
seriously.
<p>   In the midst of a global economic crisis, Clinton was
negotiating down to the wire this weekend with congressional
Republicans to fulfill American financial obligations to the
International Monetary Fund and the United Nations, organizations
that Washington insists on trying to lead even though it will not
pay its bills to them.
<p>   Clinton appears to have lost his two-year campaign to persuade
major oil companies to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea
through Turkey, even though he had declared it an American
strategic priority.
<p>   And this week, in what Clinton will hail as a foreign-policy
triumph, he is expected to preside over an interim
Israeli-Palestinian agreement that is coming so late, and is being
accomplished so grudgingly, that both sides fear that it will fall
apart a few weeks after it is signed.
<p>   "Sometimes moments of truth arrive," David Calleo of the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said. "It's hard
to distinguish between a lack of credibility that comes from the
discrediting of an individual president and that coming from a
certain accretion of realism. The administration has been trying to
make water run uphill and make policy by declaration. But both the
president and the policies are running out of gas."
<p>   Examples abound of how it is simply easier to say "no" to a
wounded president, to delay, prevaricate or even reject his
declared policies.
<p>   In the case of the Caspian pipeline, the oil companies argued
that at today's petroleum prices the multibillion-dollar project
made no economic sense. But a stronger or more focused president
might have made a persuasive case, perhaps directly to the public,
that the pipeline was not about transporting oil today, but about
America's energy security and its political influence well into the
next century. And such a president might have organized the
financial resources required to make it happen.
<p>   This president's commitment to foreign policy has always been
secondary. Clinton has rarely shown much boldness or even the
willingness to punish those like Milosevic, Saddam Hussein of Iraq
or even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel who taunt and
defy him. That is especially true with Israel, because White House
punishment of Israel threatens core Democratic Party
constituencies.
<p>   In dealing with the Caucasus region and the Middle East, Calleo
said, "the world doesn't see much leadership of a sustained
positive kind." The Middle East encompasses issues other than the
Israeli-Palestinian relationship, "and to be on the outs with both
Iraq and Iran at the same time isn't much of a strategy, and yet it
just goes on and on," he said.
<p>   In the Balkans the American effort to re-create a kind of
multiethnic Hapsburg empire is too ambitious, but would certainly
require lots of troops on the ground in Kosovo. "We have these
policies but don't want to pay the price to sustain them, and
everyone knows it," Calleo said. "If you can't or won't follow
through on your threats, it's not much good to make them."
<p>   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., bluntly said Sunday in a discussion
of Kosovo on "Fox News Sunday," "I think we have been diverted
by the Lewinsky matter. There is still no long-term plan, a good
description of what our objectives are."
<p>   McCain added about Clinton: "He is putting our young people in
danger. Any president must go to the American people and explain
what is going on."
<p>   Of course, to order a bombing campaign because of the Kosovo
crisis would be a failure of American and NATO policy, which is to
threaten Milosevic into meeting some set of American objectives.
But bombing would only make it harder to stave off a humanitarian
disaster among the nearly 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees and make
it more likely that NATO ground troops would have to be introduced,
senior administration officials concede.
<p>   "NATO knows this, but Milosevic knows it, too," one senior
American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Add
that to Lewinsky and you get a real credibility problem."
<p>   Robert Kagan, of the Carnegie Endowment, says that the lack of
American decisiveness inevitably produces an unwillingness of other
countries and actors to follow.
<p>   "It would be simple to say that because of Lewinsky this
president is distracted," Kagan said. "But the problem of
credibility transcends the Lewinsky affair, though it only
exacerbates the problems." The matter is especially acute in an
altering world of economic crisis where bilateral policies are less
important than multilateral ones, "when we really do need some
concentrated leadership of an unusual kind."
<p>   International indecisiveness in NATO, the United Nations and
global financial institutions starts with American indecisiveness,
Kagan said.
<p>   "You have a Cabinet secretary"  --  such as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright  --  "issuing threats while it is soon clear that
the administration will not follow through," he said, whether the
topic is the Middle East or Kosovo. "You have the secretary of
defense," William Cohen, "speaking for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and they don't want to go into Kosovo." And Clinton "doesn't have
the moral authority to order them to go on the one hand, or provide
them the budget that makes it easier for them to go."
<p>   He described the situation as "a simple paradox: If it were
clearer that we were prepared to take action, it would be easier
for others to get on board."
<p>   For Richard Haass, foreign policy director for the Brookings
Institution, Clinton's "unwillingness to level with Congress and
the American people over Bosnia has a bad aftertaste" and
resonates with negative implications for Kosovo, Haass said, where
"we've dithered for months."
<p>   There are similar gaps between rhetoric and action over Iraq,
Haass said. He compared Clinton's statements in February when he
talked of going to war over access for arms inspectors to the
administration's willingness now to let the United Nations solve
the problem. "They blinked in February," Haass said, "and now
we're reluctant to bring the crisis to a head."
<p>   In general, he said, "We've allowed matters to drift in the
Middle East, and Clinton has lost respect. He hasn't been willing
to blow the whistle or speak the truth publicly.
<p>   "The cumulative effect is that this is an administration that
friends and foes alike can ignore," Haass said. "That is
dangerous."<p></td></tr></table></center></p></font><hr> <p><font size=+0></font></p>
