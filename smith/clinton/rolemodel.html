<P>(JWR) --- (http://www.jewishworldreview.com)

<P>NOW THAT BILL CLINTON has been impeached, brace yourself for a lot of
hysteria and a lot of lies. A Senate
<BR>trial is being depicted as a terrible trauma that would be just too
much of an ordeal to be inflicted on the American people.

<P>Ask yourself: How much have you personally suffered as a result of the
impeachment in the House of Representatives? How much sleep did you lose?
How many headaches did you have? Did you even have to postpone your Christmas
shopping to get yourself together?

<P>Of course not. Nor will a Senate trial cause us to collapse like a house
of cards. Nobody is forced to watch it or read about it. If the public
is bored with it and stops watching, the major TV networks are unlikely
to keep broadcasting it, even if it is still shown on C-SPAN or some of
the cable networks.

<P>When the impeachment of Richard Nixon was before Congress, we were in
the midst of a war in Vietnam that was far bigger than Clinton's four-day
bombing of Iraq. Within a week after Nixon resigned, the stock market began
rising.

<P>The sky is not going to fall, no matter what happens to Bill Clinton.

<P>All the desperate ingenuity that has gone into trying to concoct some
meaningless compromise like "censure" might lead us to think that impeachment
was something inhuman like flogging or hanging. It is not. Even conviction
in the Senate would lead to nothing worse than an early departure from
the White House for the Clintons -- and no doubt multimillion dollar book
deals for both of them soon thereafter.

<P>The orchestrated hysteria over what a trauma a Senate trial will be
for us all is just a continuation of the political spinning that has been
going on ever since Clinton got into trouble and had to create distractions
from his own wrong-doing. Opinion polls show that the public has fallen
for a lot of it.

<P>Thank heaven there were enough people in the House of Representatives
with enough character to recognize the high stakes when a president thumbs
his nose at the law, no matter how many times the spin masters talk about
sex and "private" behavior. Perjury is not private behavior and neither
is obstruction of justice. Both undermine the whole foundation of law that
the president takes an oath to uphold.

<P>Those in the House of Representatives who saw through the smokescreen
of disinformation and distractions, and who had the courage to buck the
polls, deserve credit for sticking to their duty. They certainly deserve
a lot better than having the rug pulled out from under them with some "deal"
in the Senate that allows perjury and obstruction of justice to escape
the penalties that the
<BR>Constitution provides for high crimes and misdemeanors.

<P>Talk about how apologetic or contrite Bill Clinton is or isn't misses
the whole point. This is not about one individual. It is about the future
of this country. Whether he pays the price or escapes through some deal,
that fact is going to be known across the length and breadth of the United
States of America. It is going to be known to our children -- and no amount
of rhetoric is going to turn a wrist slap into anything other than a wrist
slap that says, loud and clear, that he got away with it.

<P>Far worse, future presidents will be left a blueprint for how they too
can operate above the law. Lie, stonewall, evade, redefine, corrupt witnesses
and launch campaigns of character assassination against all who expose
or challenge you. The enormous powers of the presidency can be used for
all these purposes -- and can be deployed to cover up things far worse
than cheap sex in the Oval Office.

<P>A cop-out for Clinton would open a Pandora's box. That is why it is
not just Bill Clinton who will be on trial in the Senate. The Senators
themselves will be on trial before the judgment of history.

<P>They will be on trial for their clarity of mind in seeing through the
rhetoric and red herrings concocted by the White House spin-masters. They
will be on trial for their courage and steadfastness in resisting the easy
way out and the habit of playing let's-make-a-deal.

<P>Public opinion matters. But that opinion has already begun to change
and the Senate's actions can change it some more. At the very least, Senators
do not take an oath to uphold the opinion polls, but to uphold the Constitution.
