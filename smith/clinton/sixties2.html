            Made in America</font></font></u></center><hr><p>

                                           

                         <P> <font color=bllue><b>Over the past week </font></b>at least one friendly analyst and perhaps others have made
                        a trenchant observation about the impeachment of Bill Clinton.

                         <P> They argue it is part of the culture war in the United States, and those seeking
                        Clinton's ouster are symbolically attacking what his generation represents. He is
            a stand-in, they argue, for the 1960s and everything bad the '60s meant for America:
            Draft-dodging and anti-war activism, drug use, bad music, free sex and
            antiestablishmentarianism.

             <P> Given Clinton's own history of draft-dodging, anti-war activism, drug use, his love for bad
            music (Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow by Fleetwood Mac comes to mind), free sexual
            activity and, well, antiestablishmentarianism, they are absolutely right. 
              <P>And one thing that happened on impeachment day, during the 80-Democrat rally at the White
            House, proves the point. While the man who dropped his drawers for oral sex in the Oval
            Office prattled on about "decency" and "civility," his wife was by his side. The look on her face,
            a smarmy "Oh-I-admire-you-so-much-Bill" look, hid the hatred for America that courses
            through her veins. 
             <P> With her impeachment mask set for the cameras, while Bill Clinton defiantly said he would not
            resign, you could imagine what was roiling in Hillary Clinton's mind: "No. He won't resign. But
            what do I mean, he? It isn't a man's world anymore. We won't resign. And we won't resign
            because we are going to finish the deconstruction we began 30 years ago in college. 
              <P>"We undermined the war against communism in Vietnam, we undermined your Victorian sexual
            morals, we destroyed the Nixon Administration and the white, male establishment it stood for. 
             <P> "Who says we should step down? The same people who belong to Nixon's party? Perhaps
            you've forgotten. We do not abide your rules and laws. Didn't you learn anything from the 1968
            Democratic National Convention or from Woodstock? Haven't you learned anything at all? We
            will not be driven from office by revanchist Republicans. 
              <P>"We brought down your president 25 years ago. We didn't come this far to allow your
            conventional morals and values to bring down our president. Perjury? About oral sex?
            Adultery? You must be kidding. So forget resignation." 
              <P>Even if Hillary wasn't thinking such things, Clinton's refusal to resign, the argument that perjury
            does not "rise to the level of an impeachable offence," the vice-president's laughable declaration
            that Clinton "will be regarded in the history books as one of our greatest presidents," all make
            the same point; i.e., the deracination of traditional American values, such as the simple truth that
            perjury is not only a sin but also a violation of the law, is complete. 
             <P> Bill Clinton is the apotheosis of the generation we saw burning draft cards and protesting on
            television: Egocentric in the extreme, without scruple, full of hatred for anything and anyone that
            would govern its infantile appetite. That Clinton has survived this long is evidence that his
            generation succeeded in the effort it began in the 60s and continues today in the White House.
            That generation did undermine the Vietnam War effort. It did destroy morals and values. 
              <P>It did bring down a president. But not because he sent burglars into the Watergate building. It
            destroyed Nixon because he represented men and women the Clinton generation despised.
            Those men and woman are the Clinton generation's own parents, the hardy citizens who
            survived the Great Depression, won World War II and built the establishment the Clintonites
            abhorred because its values stood in opposition to their own. That same munificent generation
            bequeathed unprecedented material prosperity to the Clinton generation, only to learn what
            happens when you overindulge offspring. They perceive you as weak. Then they eat you. 
             <P> One of the speakers at Clinton's post-impeachment rally at the White House, House Minority
            Leader Rep. Dick Gephardt, was right about one thing, but not for the reason he thinks. The
            impeachment vote was a "disgrace to our country and Constitution," Gephardt said. Yes,
            Clinton is a disgrace. But Gephardt was wrong about another. "The American people deserve
            better than what they've received over the last five months." 
              <P>Wrong. We didn't deserve any better over the last five months, or the last five years of his
            presidency, or the last 30, since the Clinton's generation's parents indulged its national tantrum. 
              <P>The American people created Bill Clinton, then they elected him president. They got what they
            deserved. <P>

Kirkwood is getting close, but he still thinks it's about a particular birth cohort. It's more fundamental than that.

 I liked the article but I disagree with the generational idea.  My younger brother was a student at Columbia College in New York City when the student riots went on there and I know it was a minority that was involved in the rioting.  Most of the students were upset about the interruption of the school and very frightened by the violence.  The sexual revolution is a vague idea, too.  Look at "From Here to Eternity"  --  the coital sex wasn't shown on the screen but everyone got the message.  Helen Gurley Brown, whose book "Sex and the Single Girl" came out in the 60's and was so notorious, was writing about her own life as a young woman in New York and Helen Gurley Brown is in her 70's.  The World War II generation engaged in plenty of premarital sex, I'm sure.  <p>   Bill Clinton and his wife do not symbolize or represent or embody the "60's generation."  Bill Clinton and his wife are selfish, corrupt, mean liars like other selfish, corrupt, mean liars who have lived in any era of history.<br>
