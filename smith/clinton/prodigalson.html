<br><b><font size=+1>Clinton, Prodigal Son, Owes Nation Detailed Apology</font></b>
<p><b>Roll Call</b>
<br><b>February 8, 1999</b> <i>Morton M. Kondracke</i>
<p><font size=+0>Not for commercial use, solely for "fair use" discussion
and education.</font>
<p><font size=+0>The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal has been analyzed legally,
politically, historically and culturally. Let's try theologically.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;A friend of mine who's a defender of President Clinton,
Gloria Doyle, declared the other day: "This case is the 'Parable of the
Prodigal Son' and you Clinton haters are the older brother.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;"The American people, like their father, love Clinton
and forgive him and you guys just can't stand it!"</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Well, I deny being a Clinton hater. I say, "Hate
the sin, love the sinner." But her formulation is certainly arresting.
And examining it may suggest a just end to the scandal -- a truly contrite
and complete apology by Clinton or tough censure by Congress.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;First, recall Jesus' parable, recorded in Luke 12.
A rich father lets his younger son have his inheritance early. The son
runs away, spends it all on debauchery and ends up broke, cleaning pigsties.
He decides to go back home.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The father sees him coming and before the son can
finish his apology, the father orders his best calf killed for a lavish
banquet and gives the son a ring and fancy clothes.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Meantime, the older brother for years has been dutifully
working hard in the fields and obeying the rules. When he hears about the
celebration, he's furious, remembering that his father never even gave
him a goat for his pals to feast on.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;When the older son goes to his father to complain,
he's told, in sum: You've had it good here, forget about it. The Bible
does not record that he is reconciled to the arrangement.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;I've always thought that this story explains in
a nutshell why Jesus was crucified: The righteous rule-makers of ancient
Israel couldn't abide a Teacher who preached automatic forgiveness for
sinners and scoundrels. The concept would upset the social order.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;There is definitely something in the attitude of
righteous Americans -- like, say, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, House
Republican leaders and the religious right -- which resembles that of the
older brother.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;They are enraged by Clinton's public support and
polls showing that big majorities of the people think he committed perjury
and obstruction of justice, but want to let him off anyway.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;On the other side, religious defenders of Clinton
-- like his local pastor, the Rev. Philip Wogaman -- usually cite Scriptures
admonishing people not to judge lest they be judged. Also, like my friend
Gloria, they counsel Clinton critics to be forgiving, like the father.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;However, Clinton defenders leave out a big item
in the parable and in Jesus' teaching: the issue of repentance.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;When he gets back home, the prodigal son declares,
"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy
to be your son." He has actually made up his mind to become an ordinary
servant in his father's house.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Religious critics of the President -- such as Jean
Bethke Elshtain of the University of Chicago -- find Clinton's apologies
and declarations of repentance hollow and unconvincing. So do I.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Elshtain said on ABC's "Nightline" last week that
Clinton's major statement last September acknowledging sin was "tethered
to a kind of defiance and truculence and determination to play hardball
all the way."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Indeed, Clinton has never once acknowledged what
he did beyond having an "inappropriate relationship" with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. He still doesn't even admit it was sexual.
He admits "deceiving" people about it, but not "lying" or coaching witnesses.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Despite his supposed declaration of repentance,
Clinton has done nothing to stop his old aide, James Carville, from waging
political "war" on his critics, or Carville's friend, Hustler publisher
Larry Flynt, from trying to destroy top Republicans.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Clinton himself took a dig at Sen. Russ Feingold
(D-Wis.) last month - calling him "sanctimonious" -- for merely wanting
to hear from witnesses in Clinton's trial.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;The White House seems to realize that it would be
bad form for people there to gloat when the Senate falls short -- probably
far short -- of the votes needed to convict him.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;But when one former Clinton adviser suggested that
Clinton ought to apologize to the country for the trouble his actions have
caused, a current top aide reportedly said that Clinton "won't grovel."</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Clinton should apologize -- and in detail. He had
an opportunity at last week's National Prayer Breakfast, but he passed
it up.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;If Clinton continues to demonstrate no real repentance,
Congress needs to censure him -- not "judging" his personal sins, but condemning
the public offenses of lying under oath and attempted obstruction of justice.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there's a fair chance that censure
moves may fail, as Democrats circulate softly worded resolutions that Republicans
won't support and Democrats refuse to use tough language.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;That would be a travesty of justice and a betrayal
of a public that has favored censure from the outset. Besides, there's
nothing in the Bible that says people who bear false witness should get
off scot-free.</font>
