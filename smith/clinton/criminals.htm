<P>&nbsp;<B>A Criminal History of Mankind</B>
<BR><B>1983 </B><I>Colin Wilson</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In 1961, two psychiatrists, Samuel Yochelson and Stanton
Samenow, began to study the mentality of criminals at St. Elizabeth's Hospital
in New York. Their initial premise was that men become criminals because
of 'deep seated psychologic problems'. They became popular with their patients
because their attitude was permissive and compassionate. They believed
that most criminals are the product of poor social conditions or problems
in early childhood (the typical liberal diagnosis--ed.), and that with
enough insight and understanding they could be 'cured'.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Gradually, they became disillusioned. They noticed that
no matter how much 'insight' they achieved into the behavior of a murderer,
rapist, or child molester, it made no difference to his actual conduct;
as soon as he left the doctor's office, he went straight back to his previous
criminal pattern. He didn't<I> want</I> to change.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Yochelson and Samenow also became increasingly skeptical
about the stories told by criminals to justify themselves. They found them
amazingly skillful in self-justification--suppressing any material that
might lose them sympathy--but the real problem lay in the criminal character.
<B>They lied as automatically as breathing.</B> They had a strong desire
to make an impression on other people ... and a great deal of their criminal
activity sprang from this desire to show off, to 'look big'.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>They were also skillful in lying to themselves. Particularly
striking is Yochelson's observation that<B> most criminals ... have developed
a psychological 'shut-off mechanism', an ability to push inconvenient thoughts
out of consciousness </B>--even to forget that they had made certain damaging
admissions about themselves at a previous meeting. 'This,' Yochelson observes,
'meant that responsibility, too, could be shut off'.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0><B>In short, the central traits of the criminal personality
were weakness, immaturity, and self-deception.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Another striking insight relates to sexuality. 'Almost
without exception, the participants in our study were either involved in
sexual activity very early or <B>(indulged in) a great deal of sexual thinking</B>
...' The criminal 'peeks through cracks in doors and peers through keyholes
to catch glimpses of mother, sister or a friend's mother or sister as she
dresses, bathes or uses the toilet'. One habitual criminal began engaging
in sex games at the age of four, with the daughter of a neighbor that took
him to school. Later, he was part of a gang who used to grab girls in alleyways
and commit rape--although if the girls showed no objection, they were allowed
to go; it was essential that they should cry and struggle.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Most children experience curiosity about sex; in the criminal,
it seems to be an obsession that narrows down the focus of his consciousness
to the idea of exploring the forbidden, of committing stealthy violations
of privacy. His sexuality becomes tinged with violence, and his criminality
with sex.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One of the most puzzling things about many cases of rape
is the damage inflicted on the victim, even when she makes no resistance.
This is because, in the criminal mind, sex is a form of crime, and crime
a form of sex. What Yochelson's observation shows is that<B> there is a
sexual component in all crime; the criminal is committing indecent assault
on society.</B></FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>This, then, brings us close to the essence of criminality:</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+0>It is a combination of egoism, infantilism, and sex.</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Earlier on, the author writes: 'This ... is the very essence
of crime: self-absorption and lack of imagination. A delinquent who mugs
an old lady or wrecks a telephone kiosk (or bombs another country--ed.)
is as absorbed in his own needs as a baby crying to be fed. Freud revealed
his own insight into crime when he remarked that a baby would destroy the
world if it had the power.'</FONT>

to the FReeper (whose handle I don't recall) for recommending this book.
Well worth reading, though not for the squeamish.</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></B>
