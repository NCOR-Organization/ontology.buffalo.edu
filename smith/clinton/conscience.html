<p><b><font size=+1>The Real Bill and Hillary Clinton and Why We Need to
Stand Strong for the Truth</font></b>
<p><b>Without Conscience</b>
<br><i>Dr. Robert Hare</i>
<p><font size=+0>Bill and Hillary Clinton have been heralded by the media,
for years, as the most virtuous couple to have ever trod this soil of ours,
but their actions speak volumes that they have absolutely no virtue. Both
Bill and Hillary have proven themselves to be woefully short on substance
and with no conscience.</font>
<p><font size=+0>According to Dr. Robert Hare, the leading authority on
psychopaths, there are approximately two million such people in the United
States. That is approximately one out of every 275 people you know.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Fortunately, only a small portion are ever violent and
they usually end up in prison. That estimate is about 17% of the two million.
The remaining 83% are people like Bill and Hillary, who plow through life
leaving many people in their wake of destruction. You know, your ordinary
garden variety of con men who do things that we couldn't do because we
do have a conscience. The person who shakes down the elderly for their
life savings and ends up on America's Most Wanted explaining that, "The
old ladies deserved it for being so stupid." Our Lord referred to a lack
of conscience as a hardened heart.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;These people are not crazy, they just ignore their
moral indicator. Like riding down the road without a speedometer.</font>
<p><font size=+0>People who do not have a conscience, for the most part,
do not care for anyone else but themselves. However, sometimes they pair
up. Dr. Hare writes:</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;"(They) usually don't get along well with one another.
The last thing an egocentric, selfish, demanding, callous person wants
is someone just like him. Two stars is one too many. Occasionally, however,
(they) become temporary partners in crime - a grim symbiosis with unfortunate
consequences for other people. Generally, one member of the pair is a "talker"
who gets his way through charm, deceit and manipulation, whereas the other
is a "doer" who prefers direct action, intimidation and force. As long
as their interests are complimentary, they make a formidable pair".</font>

<p><font size=+0>When someone has a large cluster of certain traits coupled
with a profound lack of remorse, it will more than likely denote a person
with no conscience. What is listed below is an indication that we may have
such a couple in the White House.</font>

boastful

<p>cold</font>
<p><font size=+0>self-sufficient</font>
<p><font size=+0>known for verbal quirks</font>
<p><font size=+0>known for intense eye contact</font>
<p><font size=+0>very intimidating</font>
<p><font size=+0>"above the law"</font>
<p><font size=+0>act as if normal laws do not apply to them</font>
<p><font size=+0>very sexually promiscuous</font>
<p><font size=+0>unconcerned about others feelings</font>
<p><font size=+0>unfazed by possibility of being found out</font>
<p><font size=+0>sense of omnipotence and entitlement</font>
<p><font size=+0>complains about media treatment</font>
<p><font size=+0>skilled wordsmiths</font>
<p><font size=+0>stunning lack of concern for the devastating effects their
actions have on others</font>
<p><font size=+0>not humiliated by public disclosure as a liar and a cheat</font>
<p><font size=+0>skilled at masking emotions</font>
<p><font size=+0>So, what can be done about these people? The only thing
that stops people who have no conscience is moral strength. Pope John Paul
II and President Ronald Reagan succeeded in bringing freedom to Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union by maintaining moral strength. Likewise, sticking
to our guns morally will be the only way to finally stop the likes of Bill
and Hillary Clinton. They are like a runaway steamroller. But even a steamroller
has to come to a halt when it is confronted by a reinforced wall.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Standing strong for the Truth will defeat Bill and Hillary.</font>
