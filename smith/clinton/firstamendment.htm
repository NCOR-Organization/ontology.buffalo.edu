href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/contact/masthead.html">BY SCOTT ROSENBERG</a></font> | <b>O</b>nce upon a time, you could count on conservatives to defend the sanctity
of property rights -- and on the ostensibly liberal media to take an
absolutist stand on behalf of free expression. But new technologies have a
way of scrambling old orthodoxies.

<p>Consider the case of the lawsuit recently filed by the Washington Post
and the Los Angeles Times against the operator of a Web site called <a
target="new" href="http://www.freerepublic.com">Free Republic.</a> Free
Republic is a right-wing bulletin board where Clinton-haters go to bond; it
features hundreds of discussion topics with titles  like "Do we dare call it
treason?" and "Billy caught lying again."  As such, it's similar to many
other conservative political Web sites.

<p>But one practice that's common among Free Republic denizens, who like to
call themselves "FReepers," is something you don't often find on other
bulletin boards: Free Republic's discussions are full of the complete texts
of other sites' news articles, cut and pasted from the original Web pages
into archived postings on the Free Republic boards. Often, the re-posted
articles are grabbed in raw HTML format -- which means that they're
formatted exactly as they originally appeared,  sometimes even including
the original graphics. (Full disclosure: Salon articles have on occasion
received this treatment from Free Republic, and we have protested to its
webmaster.)

<p>This practice is what has brought down the wrath of the two newspapers,
who have sued Free Republic for copyright infringement. Free Republic says
its postings are legal under the concept of the "fair use" exemption from
copyright rules -- which allows the limited reuse of copyrighted material
for purposes like criticism and comment.

<p>Who's right? Is this a case of "big boys" picking on a plucky grass-roots
operation, as Matt Drudge would have it? Or are the newspapers just cracking
down on a flagrant violation of the law? The Free Republic suit has
significance that goes beyond the immediate emotions of this scandal-stoked
moment. The law always lags behind technology, and the rules that govern
copyright today have yet to establish clear lines of legality for use and
reuse of material on the Web -- so cases like this are likely to have a
major impact in shaping the medium's future.

<p>Free Republic's webmaster, Jim Robinson, a Fresno, Calif., retired software executive, has posted a barnburning  <a
target="new" href="http://www.freerepublic.com">editorial</a> on his home
page that quotes the First Amendment and then argues: "Any man, corporation
or government entity who wants to challenge our right to discuss news
accounts (copyrighted or not) of public policy issues or political events or
of government corruption, etc., in our non-commercial, not-for-profit,
public electronic townhall forum should first examine each and every word of
the First Amendment above and then tell us which words they don't
understand."

<p>You go, Jim! Robinson is right that First Amendment protections apply
most strongly to political speech, which is definitely what Free Republic
traffics in -- and that fair use claims are bolstered by his site's
noncommercial nature. On the other hand, nobody is trying to stop the FReepers from <i>"discussing"</i> news accounts. The issue is whether they
can <i>republish</i> them in their entirety.

<p>Here's where a close look at the fair use standard -- courtesy of the <a
target="new" href="http://www.nolo.com/nn75.html">legal encyclopedia</a> on
Nolo Press' Web site -- helps. Nolo lists several tests for determining
whether a use is a "fair use." Free Republic fails most of them.

<p>One test is, "Are you just copying or creating something new?" Though the
FReepers do sometimes comment on and criticize the stories they post, they
don't "transform" the articles in any significant way.  Consider <a
target="new" href=" http://209.67.114.212/forum/a73171.htm">this re-post</a>
of a Jan. 24, 1998, Washington Post article about Lucianne Goldberg by Howard
Kurtz and David Streitfeld -- duplicated on the Free Republic site down to
the Post's copyright line. The sum total of commentary on the piece consists
of a single post from one Free Republic member that reads: "Hey
Kurtz, you lickspittle!!! You left out the part where Georgie
Stephanopoulus [sic] tried to shout down Bill Kristol!"

<p>Another test that Free Republic fails is "The more you take, the less
fair your use is likely to be." A random dip into the Free Republic boards
shows that they are chock-full of stories copied from all over the Web.

<p>But the killer test here is the one that says, "Don't compete with the
source you're copying from" -- don't "impair the market" for the original
work. This is undoubtedly where the newspaper lawyers will be building their
case -- since Web surfers reading the stories on the Free Republic site will
not be visiting the newspapers' own sites to do so.

<p>Both the Post and the Times are now charging small fees for access to
their archived stories. I think that's a bad strategy, and I
doubt either company will ever make much money this way. But I have no doubt
that Free Republic, by hosting a kind of do-it-yourself archive of news
stories copied from the newspaper Web sites, is brazenly ripping these
companies off.

<p>Free Republic and its lawyer have charged that they're being sued because
of their political bent. The site certainly takes a dim view of the
mainstream media as, in Robinson's words, a "liberal propaganda machine
whose goal is to continue the expansion of a collective state and to control
every aspect of our lives and fortunes."

<p>But I don't think the Post and the Times give a hoot where Robinson falls
on the political spectrum; they're just protecting their property. And if
you look deeper into the motivations in this dispute, they've got a point.

<p>The glaringly obvious question here is, "Why don't the FReepers just
link?" The Web is a uniquely flexible medium for people who want to do lots
of line-by-line close critiques of news stories -- which is what Free
Republic says it's up to in its quest to root out "the socialist government
propaganda slant on the news." On the Web, you don't have to photocopy or
republish; links do the job without infringing on anyone's copyright. (It's
true that links to current stories in the Washington Post and the L.A. Times
expire after a couple of weeks, when the newspapers move the articles into
their pay-per-view archives; but that would still give the commentators on
Free Republic's fast-moving boards plenty of time to dissect them for bias.)

<p>My hunch about what's really going on here is that the folks at Free
Republic hate the "liberal media" so blindly that they don't want to
contribute to the traffic on the newspapers' sites. If they link to a media
site, they contribute to that site's traffic, which helps that site sell ads
and possibly even make some money. Why help your enemies make a buck when
you can violate their copyrights instead? And so the FReepers betray
one of the most fundamental principles of conservative thought -- the
protection of property rights -- rather than add a few clicks to the L.A.
Times' and Washington Post's totals.
