nd oh so conveniently) tailored to do the job of making true. Ontology as we conceive it is a hard business, and there is no easy route to establishing what sorts of entities are involved in making true sentences (judgments, beliefs, propositions) of given sorts. The entities in question should be such that we have independent reasons for supposing them to exist – above all reasons derived from science or from those of our common-sense pre-theoretical intuitions which make science possible. The best theories of truthmaking will then rest on the view that the components of reality responsible for truthmaking are entities of already familiar sorts: tables, photons, surgical procedures and handshakes. (2) The True StoryNot every true sentence has a truthmaker, but every true sentence has a true story. We reject truthmaker maximalism. That is, we hold that it is a mistake to define truth by means of:For any proposition P, P is true := P has a truthmaker.We accept that there are many sentences whose truth seems to be ‘made’ (in the sense of established and not caused) by the existence of certain objects. But it is just as clear to us that there are many sentences whose truth is a matter of (as we might loosely express it) enitities of given sorts not existing or not bearing certain characteristics. The truth of ‘Mario exists’ is a matter of Mario’s existing. The truth of ‘There does not exist a golden mountain’ is a matter of there not being anything that is both a mountain and made of gold. In this essay we give a precise definition of the truthmaker relation between a truth and an entity. We isolate a special class of true judgments: those that have truthmakers. We then give an inductive description – what we call a true story – of the ways that true judgments not in this basic class come to be true. Our goal is to show that the truth of every true judgment can be shown to be a matter of either (i) that judgment falling in the class of those judgments that are made true, or (ii) of there being a recursive account of the truth of that judgment, formulable in terms of its analytic relation to judgments in that special class, in such a way that each judgment can be assigned a certain node within a tree of derivations from judgments in the basic class. Telling true stories is harder than the followers of Tarski have encouraged us to believe, however, because the business of establishing where a given truth falls in this hierarchy is not itself a recursive: thus it is normally not something that can be read off from there mere logical form of a corresponding sentence.We stand for the thesis that every true judgment has a true story behind it. The work of our account shall not be the formulation of the tree of judgment types, but rather the piecemeal business of demonstrating empirically that true judgments of a succession of different sorts may each be shown to have a place on this tree. For this work, there are no easy formulae.The world is a messy place; too messy for there to be a simple algorithm that can tell us, given that the judgment is true, whether this is so because the judgment has truthmakers, or because it demands a true story of some other kind. Rather, we must proceed case by case, like empirical scientists, with no a priori guarantee of success. As we reject truthmaker maximalism, so we are sceptical of any position claiming to have a formula for generating the true story solely on the basis of the logical forms of the corresponding judgments. The hard cases are in part so hard precisely because it is difficult to establish what this logical form should be (consider: ‘John is unhappy’, ‘The whereabouts of the garden hose are uncertain’). In what follows, therefore, we take the responsibility of sketching the true stories of a representative sample of different judgment types. By successfully grappling, one by one, with the most difficult cases, we hope to demonstrate the practicability of our position. (3) Necessitation and ProjectionThe goals of different truthmaker theorists are not entirely consistent with each other. What is the relationship between a truthmaker and truth conditions? Exactly what sort of “making” are we dealing with here? Are we merely searching for something whose existence ensures (necessitates) the truth of the relevant judgment, or do we wish for some condition of relevance as well, so that the truth of the relevant judgment likewise ensures the existence of its truthmaker? Here we defend a view which insists on the requirement of this extra relevance condition. We hypothesize that a serviceable theory of truthmaking, a theory which allows the formulation of true stories for true judgments of all types, is yielded by a theory of truthmaking as the “intersection of projection and necessitation,” a theory first described in [Smith 99], as part of the effort, there, to safeguard truthmaker theory against the arguments of Restall [Restall 96], which showed that truthmaker theories without relevance conditions would fall victim to slingshot arguments. Under this conception, for an entity x to be a truthmaker for a truth p is for it to satisfy the two conditions of Necessitation (x N p) and Projection (x P p), where these are defined as follows:(N) x N p := x exists and that x exists entails that por, in symbols: E!x ( ((( ( E! x ( ( p)(P) x P p := p and that p entails that x existsin symbols: p ( ((( ( p ( ( E!x). Projection is thus in a certain respect the dual of necessitation. Truthmaking itself can now be defined as follows: (TM) 	x TM p := x N p ( x P pWe might call this the P(N theory (pronounced to rhyme with ‘pun’). (N) captures the fundamental idea of truthmaker theory, that the truthmaker should necessitate the corresponding truth. (P) captures the additional factor of relevance – it ensures, in conjunction with (N), that a truth which has a truthmaker is about its truthmaker. The P(N theory is not without its weak points. In some cases it may seem to yield too few truthmakers. According to P(N, a generic existential claim such as ‘There are rabbits’ does not have individual rabbits as its truthmakers. This is because, for every rabbit, (N) is satisfied, but (P) fails: it is never true of that rabbit that its particular existence is entailed by the judgment ‘There are rabbits’. On the other hand, for some judgments, the theory may seem to recognize too many truthmakers. Given any two things that are mutually existentially dependent, it is clear that one makes true a given proposition if and only if the other does. The problem here is not that there are multiple truthmakers for a single truth. It is a common doctrine among the friends of truthmakers that the truthmaking relation will, in general, be, not one-to-one, but many-to-many. The danger, rather, is that such mutual existential dependence will serve as a springboard to set out of action the constraint of relevance – allowing Restall’s argument for collapse to rear its ugly head once more. Thus, on certain readings of mutual existential dependence the north pole of a magnet will make it true that the south pole exists. And if one thinks that {Socrates} and Socrates are mutually existentially dependent, then one is compelled to accept that {Socrates} is a truthmaker for the proposition ‘Socrates exists’.	On our view, these are bullets worth biting. As realists, we take it that every proposition makes some demand on the world; it defines a certain way that reality must be. When reality meets, or fits, this condition, then the proposition is true. Our concept of truthmaking does the following job: it isolates those cases where the condition consists exactly in the demand that some specific entities exist. In fact, it follows from our definition that for any x, y and p such that x TM p and y TM p, x and y entail each others’ existence.  Thus, as a matter of course, cases of generic reference (‘There are rabbits’) do not have truthmakers among the corresponding particulars. Likewise, of course, if one thing exists, necessarily, exactly when another does, then to demand that one exists is to demand that the other does. So too, of course when thinking about Socrates we thereby do not of necessity also think about {Socrates}. But we are determining here what conditions in the world must obtain for a sentence to be true, and there is no reason why these should exactly coincide with associated conditions pertaining to the notion of relevance cognitively conceived.(4) Ontologically Basic PropositionsA good theory of truthmaking should concern itself not with logical but with ontological form. For a truth to be of ontologically basic form is for it to possess at least one truthmaker. The true story for each ontologically basic truth p is very simple. It is of the form, ‘p is made true by x’. We may write:OB(p) := (x. x TM pThe paradigmatic examples of ontologically basic truths will be those expressed by existence attribution sentences involving proper names, judgments of the form ‘Mario exists’. These sentences will be written as ‘E!(Mario)’, which is intended as shorthand for, ‘(x. x = Mario’. It is telling that the paradigmatic examples of ontologically basic truths are not of logically atomic form. Conversely, many examples of truths expressed by logically atomic sentences are not of ontologically basic form. ‘That liquid is colorless’, for example, although it takes the form of a simple predication, is in fact a judgment stating that the liquid in question lacks color properties. It is, as we might say, in virtue of the nonexistence of the latter that the judgment is true. As already noted, there is no simple algorithm which enables us to determine which syntactic forms can correspond to judgments of ontologically basic form. On the other hand, however, the definition has one monumental advantage over that of ‘logical atomicity.’ The latter is a relative notion, in the sense that one judgment may be expressed both as a logically atomic proposition, and as a logically complex proposition (‘x is colorless’ for example, may be expressed both as ‘Colorless(x)’ and ‘(Colored(x)’). As Frege observed, there is no such thing as the logical form of any given natural language expression. The notion of the ontologically basic is in contrast absolute: no matter how a judgment is expressed, its ontologically basic or non-basic status remains the same. The inductive hierarchy we propose will be constructed by finding first of all the (representative examples of) basic truths, and then, for all other truth-value bearing judgments, an ontological form that is (ideally at least) likewise invariant under different logical regimentations of the judgments in question. (5) On Truthvalue BearersIn line with our eschewal of a conception of the world as peopled by proposition-shaped entities, we eschew also commitment to the existence of abstract propositions themselves. Truthvalue bearers (truthbearers, for short) are declarative utterances, either written, performed, mentally judged, or perhaps, simply believed. We use the terms ‘judgment’ and ‘proposition’ interchangeably to mean ‘truthvalue bearer’. When we use the term ‘sentence’ we wish to remain neutral as to truthbearing capacity. (6) The Ontologically Complex‘That was a kiss of Mary by John’, said while pointing to the happy couple in their moment of embrace, if true, is ontologically basic. It indexically refers to a specific event. That event, call it k, is an instance of the universal kissing, and it is existentially dependent on both John and Mary. The ‘that’ functions rigidly, like a proper name. Therefore, the truth of the sentence implies the existence of this particular event, just as the existence of the event implies the relevant truth.	‘John is kissing Mary’, said for example while speculating about what is going on in the house down the street, is not ontologically basic. For, whereas the existence of the relevant k would entail its truth, the converse does not hold: it is not the case that ‘John is kissing Mary’ entails that k exists. Thus it turns out that many ordinary material relational attributions, though standardly regimented as logically atomic, are ontologically complex. In particular, as Frank Ramsey and Donald Davidson saw, they often host an existential quantifier: they are true if and only if there is some event of the relevant sort. 	‘John is not kissing Mary’, likewise, is not ontologically basic. Some have argued that it is the totality of what John is doing right now, or the totality of goings on across the earth, combined with the fact that this is indeed the totality of all goings on, or perhaps with the fact that some select subset of goings on rules out or excludes that John is kissing Mary right now. We shall see that these contrivances are superfluous. To use the helpful (if ontologically dispensable) terminology of possible worlds: the goal of truthmaker theory is to find precisely what condition is common exclusively to those worlds on which the given judgment is true. For ontologically basic truths, this condition is simply the existence of some entity (or of some group of entities). For the rest, the condition may be more complex. When we examine all of those worlds on which the proposition ‘John is not kissing Mary’ is true, we find the following to be that exclusive condition: These are all worlds, and all of the worlds, on which there exists no event which is a present-moment kissing of Mary by John.There is no object whose existence is precisely what a world needs in order for a “negative fact judgment” to be true. Even factualists (e.g. Armstrong) – holders of the view according to which there exist particularized entities called facts – face this problem insofar as they hope to make true every negative judgment by means of a “Totalizer”  since different possible worlds contain different totalized sets of positive facts. Truthmaker maximalism comes at the price of a very weak definition of ‘truthmaker’, one that cannot make the distinction between the ontologically basic and the non-complex. 	Another important group of ontologically complex judgments are general truths such as: ‘All swans are white.’ This judgment is true at a world if and only if every swan there is white. Which swans are white changes from world to world. Again, we see that there is no particular entity (a certain congregation of swans, perhaps) whose existence is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the judgment. It is at a point like this that one could be tempted toward factualism: the view that there exist particularized entities called facts, that, for example, ‘All swans are white’ is true if and only if there exists the fact that all swans are white. In the sequel, we illustrate how one may avoid this tendency. It may be true that assertions like ‘there are facts’and ‘such-and-such is a fact’ can be informative and meaningful. Yet these constructions should not lead us to the view that facts are particularized entities, any more than the meaningfulness of ‘John went for Mary’s sake’ should lead us to a view of particularized sakes. Fact-constructions are redundancies. ‘It is a fact that all swans are white’ is just a pretty way of asserting ‘all swans are white’. At least, nothing is added to the ontological analysis. In the sequel, we show how to combine this intuition with semantic realism, in the context of a theory of true stories.(7) The True Story (Tarskian Part)Without further ado, we present our general account. The account we give is modal, but it is not formulated in the terminology of possible worlds. Rather, we take the modal notion of necessity as primitive. Likewise, we take as primitive what it is for something to exist. This latter point requires us to look briefly at the issue of rigid designation and of how to handle non-denoting terms. Some judgments, in particular, modally qualified attributions (‘Pegasus might have been’) and negations of existential attributions (‘Pegasus does not exist’) may be true, even when the putative entity putatively named does not exist. For the vast majority of sentences, however, it is desirable to hold that existential presuppositions are being made by those who make the corresponding judgments: all entities named in a judgment must exist, in order for that judgment to be true. For Mario to fail to be hungry, he must first exist. In our account, existential presuppositions are the only form of presupposition it is necessary to consider. 	For each arbitrary proposition (, there is a true story for ( if and only if ( is true (a true story is always true). The conditions for different types of judgments are given in the following clauses, which should be interpreted against the background of the general requirement that all existential presuppositions are satisfied. If ( is ontologically basic: There exists a truthmaker for ( .If ( is the negation of a true proposition (: There is no true story for (.If ( is the disjunction of propositions ( and (: There is a true story either for ( or for (.If ( is a proposition of the form, ‘Everything is such that (’ (i.e., if ( may be regimented as ‘(x. (’ ): There is a true story for every proposition obtained by substituting the name of some existing entity for the bound pronoun in (. It is tempting to think of a true story as itself a judgment. This must not be taken too seriously, for circularity’s sake. Rather, there is a true story (and we may truly judge, ‘there is a true story’, and truly tell the related story) precisely when the world satisfies a certain condition – precisely the condition laid out in the clauses above. This is a subtle business. What we are claiming here is that ‘John is not kissing Mary’ is true precisely when the world lacks any entity meeting the description ‘a present-moment kissing of Mary by John’. It is true when the world is such that no present kiss of Mary by John is to be found on it. Negative conditions and general conditions of this sort may be met, by a world, without the existence of negative or general facts.As emphasized above, this inductive structure of the “truth type” of a given true judgment, is only the framework, in the most general sense, in which we tell true stories. There is nothing inductive about the manner in which we demonstrate that all true judgments will have true stories. Rather, this is an empirical claim. The remainder of our task shall be to justify it empirically, case by case. (8) CasesHere is a list of cases we shall address (possibly with some overlap)Singular Existentials Standard predications of necessary intrinsicsStandard predications in the category of accident Standard extrinsic relational sentencesContingent formal predicative and relational sentences, intrinsic relational sentencesParadigmatic negative and totalizer sentencesIdentity statementsLogical truthsTime-indexed truths Alethic modalities Counterfactuals Propositions marked by vagueness Arithmetical truthsSingular existentialsParadigm case: ‘John exists’.These cases are the most uncontroversial examples of ontologically basic propositions that we can provide. They are true if and only if the entity to which existence is attributed does in fact exist. It is important to consider the negations of these statements. Can they be true? If so, questions about the nature of naming and reference are raised. There are both presuppositional and non-presuppositional uses of names. To hold, as we do, that negations of singular existentials are sometimes true, is to hold that these involve a non-presuppositonal use of names. One means of accounting for this, as mentioned in footnote 4, is to treat names in such cases as rigid definite descriptions. Incidentally, a true rigid definite description predication follows the paradigm of the predications in category 2).Standard predications of necessary intrinsicsParadigm cases: ‘John is a man’, ‘This experience is mine’Both of these cases are ontologically basic. If one is a man, then one is necessarily a man. Thus, if it is true that John is a man, then this is a fact that follows him thoroughout modal space, and will therefore be true if and only if John exists (Aristotle’s predications in the category of substance are included here). Likewise, an experience of mine is necessarily an experience of mine, and the associated judgment will be true if and only if the experience exists. On the negative side, ‘John is not a man’, if true, is ontologically basic (and if false, is necessarily false), for the same reason as in the previous cases. This furthers the case for the distinction between logical and ontological form. Standard predications in the category of accidentParadigm cases: ‘John is hungry’, ‘John is running’The first case involves the existence of a state or quality of being hungry, the second the existence of a process of running. In both cases the entities in question are existentially dependent on a certain substantial bearer, namely John. The standard cases here turn out in fact to be ontologically complex: they are existentially quantified and assert (generically) the existence of some state, quality or process satisfying a certain description, rather than asserting (rigidly) the existence of some particular event. 	4) Standard extrinsic relationsParadigm case: ‘John is kissing Mary’These cases, too, involve an event (here, a kiss, or kissing event) whose existence necessitates the truth of the relevant judgment, though in standard cases it is only that a trope of that sort exist, that is entailed by the truth of the judgment. These standard cases are then ontologically basic: they are existential generalizations of ontologically basic judgments. 5a) Contingent intrinsic predicationsParadigm cases: ‘John’s height is 5( 3(’, ‘That fingernail is a part of Agata’s finger’, ‘Loretta is located in Lausanne (at the present moment)’.Like predications of necessary intrinsics, these are cases that seem to be true purely as a matter of the way the relata are, which is to say that nothing further than the existence of the things themselves seems to be required in order for these sentences to be true. However, the judgments here are not contingently necessarily (necessarily true if true in fact). Rather, they are straightforwardly contingent: Agata could have cut her nails yesterday, John could have eaten more spinach, and Loretta could have vacationed in Interlaken, instead. Yet it seems bizarre to say that there are extra particulars in the world, making true the parthood relation of Agata’s nail to Agata, the property of John of having height of measure 5(3(, or the location relation between Loretta and Lausanne.In fact, however, the judgments at issue are ontologically basic and the entities that do the truthmaking work, here, are not bizarre at all. We hold a theory of events according to which events are in high degree rigid beings: they have almost all of their properties essentially. If the Titanic had sunk an hour later than it did, then the event referred to by the description ‘the sinking of the Titanic’ would have been a different entity from the event that is in fact referred to by that description, and likewise if a different iceberg had been involved, or if the ship had sunk in a different region of the Atlantic. This rigidity is peculiar to events. Objects like people and ocean-liners are such that their lives could have been filled with different events than those which actually occur. The Titanic could have made it to America. John had oranges for lunch, but he could have had bananas instead. Thus we say that a certain event being a part of a life is a contingent matter. But what is contingent is not that the event was a part of the life (which is itself an extended event). Rather, it is contingent that this particular extended event, including an eating-of-oranges incident yesterday, was John’s life, that this particular collision and tragedy was the (conclusion of the) history of the Titanic.Lives (like John’s, or the history of the Titanic) are kinds of events, determinately filled regions of spacetime. They correspond to what are popularly called the ‘spatiotemporal worms’ whose instantaneous temporal parts exactly overlap, in succession, those substances whose lives they are supposed to be. If x is John’s life, then x is roughly: the maximal event in which John is the exclusive participant. John’s life is existentially dependent on John. Crucially, as with all events, the converse is not true. John could have lived differently. His life would then have been different, though John would still have been himself.This is the key to the true stories of judgments of the given sort. Among the essential properties of John’s life are its spatial location and material composition at every instant during which it exists. John’s life is therefore precisely the entity we need to make true the predications of formal measurement properties, contingent parthood relations, and so on.	‘John’s height is 5( 3(’ may be viewed as a conjunction. Let L name the entity which is John’s life. Then the predication may be read as: ‘L involves a 5( 3( height at its now-slice, and L is John’s life’. L, on our account, makes both conjuncts true. We can think of John’s life as a relational moment, in Husserl’s sense, connecting John to his height at each successive instant.5b) Intrinsic relational sentences	Paradigm case: ‘Mary is taller than John’These are judgments whose truth is a matter of necessary relations between the relata or attributes of the relata. Judgments of this sort are ontologically complex and their true stories are inductively based on the cases described in 5a). Intrinsic relations are marked by the absence of any relational moment – an entity existentially dependent on both relata. As such, there will in general be no one entity both necessitating and projected by the relevant judgment, and it is for this reason that these judgments are ontologically complex. Some have spoken of letting pairs, tuples and the like, serve as truthmakers in cases such as this. On such a view, if {a, b} were the relevant pair, with with this pair itself playing the truthmaker role. We hold that pairs are like states of affairs – they are spurious reflections of corresponding linguistic forms; thus it is preferable to avoid a commitment to pairs as entities. In particular, we do not recognize anything in the meaning of ‘the existence of the pair a and b’ other than the assertion, ‘both a and b exist’. This suggests one possible extension of the TM relation:{a,b} TM2 p iff  		a and b both exist, p is true, and (E!a & E!b) <=> p.However nothing interesting will be gained in this way. Our motives are to be as precise as possible in accounting for exactly what ontological conditions correspond to the truth of a given sentence. And the ontological conditions that would be described, eg, by p if p had a TM2 “pair” truthmaker, are precisely the conditions that we would come to by treating p as an ontologically complex statement, whose true story was that the true story for both ‘E!a’ and ‘E!b’ were told. Furthermore, the fuss about pairs is generally introduced in order to handle sentences like ‘a is a part of b.’ The reductionist account of pair-truthmaking suggested here is inadequate to this kind of case: in general both a and b might exist but a not be a part of b. Thus to successfully invoke pairs would require a more robust theory thereof, which we hope to have shown is unmotivated, since we have given an adequate account of this type of proposition in section 5a). The first sample case is analytically equivalent to: ‘There is an x and a y such that x is the height of Mary (in feet, say), y is the height of John(also in feet), and x>y.’ Now, if the judgment is true, then the greater than relation between the two measurement values will be a necessary truth, and therefore will not affect the true story (for a necessary truth p, involving no entities other than x and y, either the existence of both relata is the true story of p, or p is true, as it were, automatically – the true story of p can be told, no matter how the world is. We address this issue below). Thus, whatever the true story is for the conjunction of the two height attribution predications will be the true story for the intrinsic relational sentence. And, to bring the point home: a height attribution predication, as we saw above, follows the paradigm of 5a). ‘Loretta is located in Lausanne’ : Location is in fact a slightly trickier case, as there remain controversies in the philosophy of space. What is it, for something to be located somewhere? Luckily, we do not need to dleve very deep into this issue. It suffices for our purposes to note that, part and parcel of the rigidity of lives and histories is their position in spacetime. Unlike their more modally flexible brethren, location in spacetime is an essential feature of processes, which means that if Loretta is located in Lausanne, then the now-slice of her life stands relevantly related to the now-slice of Lausanne, and that both have their relevant location properties essentially. Negative and totalizer sentences: Paradigm cases: ‘John is not hungry’, ‘all rabbits are mammals’, ‘There are exactly six people in this room’We include these for perspicuity, as it is cases of these sorts for which the recursive picture we displayed earlier was painted. ‘John is not hungry’: This is true when there is no true story to be told for ‘John is hungry’. If ‘John is hungry’ were true, its true story would be that there existed some hungriness state of John’s. Thus, the true story here is that there does not exist any hungriness state of John’s.‘All rabbits are mammals’ : This is true when, for every existing entity x, ‘x is not a rabbit or x is a mammal’ has a true story. Equivalently, it is true when there does not exist anything that is a rabbit and is not a mammal. Whether we view this as a general, or a negative, condition, is immaterial. For factualists, on the other hand, this constitutes a major challenge: it is by no means straightforward that general facts just are negative facts.‘There are exactly six people in this room’ : This is analytically equivalent to the conjunction: ‘There are six mutually distinct people in this room, and there are not any seven mutually distinct people in this room.’ The true story for the first conjunct will be the existence of exactly six people each in the room and not identical to the five others. The true story for the second conjunct will be the nonexistence of any seven people each in the room and not identical to the six others. The true story for the target statement is the story of both of the conjuncts taken together.Identity statements (synchronic):Paradigm cases: ‘Cicero is Tully’, ‘The morning star is the evening star’There are two ways we may read judgments of this sort, corresponding roughly to the de re/de dicto distinction. De re, this judgment asserts of the thing referred to by the name ‘Cicero’ that it is identical to the thing referred to by the name ‘Tully’. When true (false), this judgment, under this analysis, is necessarily true (false). It is either asserting of one thing, that it is the same as itself, or asserting of two distinct things that they are identical. Here is another example of a difficulty in recogizing ontological form on the basis of syntactic properties: true de re identity statements are to be treated via the predication in of necessary intrinsics paradigm, false ones via the intrinsic relational paradigm (if x ( y, then the existence of both x and y is necessary and sufficient for the truth of ‘x ( y’). The second possibility is a de dicto reading. It is easier to consider examples using definite descriptions, rather than names. While it is true that the morning star is the same as the evening star, it is intuitively possible that these might have been different celestial bodies. More precisely, it is intuitively possible that these descriptions might have picked out distinct entities. In the de dicto paradigm, the statement ‘The morning star is the evening star’ is to be read as the assertion : ‘There is an x such that x is the morning star and x is the evening star’. And this kind of judgment should be familiar to our readers thus far: its true story is told whenever there is something, x, such that the true story of ‘x is the morning star and x is the evening star’ is told.Logical truthsParadigm cases: ‘Every entity either is or is not a man’, ‘John is hungry or John is not hungry’ ‘It is not the case that something is and is not a man’ ‘John is identical to John’(de re), In general, these cases are ontologically complex. They are such that their true stories will always be tellable, no matter how it is with the world. This is modulated only by the occurrence of existential presupposition. Thus, we might say that ‘John is hungry or John is not hungry’ is only true if John exists, because otherwise this statement fails to express a proposition. But John’s existence certainly suffices: then, either ‘John is hungry’ or ‘John is not hungry’ will always have a true story. And for cases involving no such presupposition, the true story is, in every case, that a trivial condition is satisfied. These judgments are simply true no matter what. We concur with Wittgenstein: the logical constants do not denote, and there is no condition in particular that the world must satisfy, in order for them to be true. 	Here we come to a sampling of cases where finding true stories becomes more difficult. From the perspective of truthmaker theory, we might say that there is an embarrasment of riches here: according as one’s ontological commitments vary on these issues (independent of the issue of truthmaking itself, and the demand that all truths have some true story), one may pick and choose the sorts of truthmakers, and true stories, one wishes to use. Our goal has been to argue for the general requirements for a theory of truthmaking and true stories, and to show by example that taking these requirements seriously in no way entails, or even suggests, that we treat ‘Facts’ or ‘States of affairs’ as a privileged class of particulars designed by God to make true all of our sentences, or any of them. Thus, in what follows we outline some main true story strategies one might pursue, according to one’s philosophical stripes. It suffices for our purposes to show that, in each case, there is at least one option available.Time-indexed truthsParadigm cases: ‘Burali-Forti existed in 1895’, ‘Burali-Forti worked in Turin in 1887’, ‘Burali-Forti in 1887 was the same person as Burali-Forti in 1895’ Strict Presentism: This view asserts that only the present exists, and there are no present truths about times other than the present: everything true ultimately is a truth exclusively about presently existing entities. The strict presentist may waver on whether putative truths about the past, such as the above examples, even have truth values. If so, they will presumably require interpretation as paraphases about the existence of things like certain sorts of evidence … current memories of Burali-Forti, documents in archives, etchings on the university walls with his signature. These pieces of evidence will presumably be the core of the true stories for the relevant sentences. Precisely what renders something evidence is crucial here: the strict presentist must convince us that the present character of things is all there is to our current conception of the past, and why for example it seems meaningful to say that the past could have been more than one way, with the present turning out exactly as it is.Permissive Presentism: like Kripkes modal realism (its problem : no truthmakers, compare with case of alethic modalities) – or witness truthmakers in the present –analogy to witness modal truthmakers. Issues about reference to the deceased and not yet born.A tensed TM relation, tensed true stories, and ways of viewing these. substances over timeentia successiva, slices of wormsd) and e) (SNAP and SPAN)Judgments of alethic modality These cases are particularly important to the true story realist, as true stories are told in terms of necessities: the mutual entailment between the judgment that x exists, and a judgment p, are the basis of the P(N theory, and the inductive hierarchy with P(N as its base. Thus far, we have remained mostly silent on the characterization of this necessity. Which modal axioms are the true ones, and which doxastic possibilities (that is, conceptual possibilities in the loose sense – that Fermat’s last theorem were false may have been a doxastic possibility, though it is not, and never was, logically possible) represent genuine metaphysical possibility? Is there a distinction between the logically possible conceptual possibilities, and the metaphysical possibilities? If so – and presumably the logical conceptual possibilities are the wider notion – then how do we account for the difference, ie, between why a logical necessity (possibility) is necessary (possible), and why a metaphysical necessity is? And this is not the only such distinction: there may be several degrees of force of necessity: There happens to be no Aleutian Islander in the room right now. It is necessary that there are no unicorns in the room right now. It is very necessary that nothing travels faster than the speed of light. It is very, very necessary that John could not have been a handshake. And It is very, very, very necessary that there are no round squares. modal realism (kripke …no truthmakers…Lewis, honest here, at least)modal properties of things. A contingency operator? Can we make this more plausible? Powers and tendencies of varying stregnth, zBprimitive category of truths (but this is awkwardly similar to states of affairs. To stress the difference, eg like the difference btw armstrongs particularized SOAs, and Nexii, would take us on a confusing tangent)how to handle aliensdifferent intensities of alethic necessity: broadly logical, metaphysical, nomic, subnomic ( no unicorns exist)jabs at the flaws in armstrongs modal truthmaker story? – at least, difference between somethings being made true intrinsically, and somethigns being necessarily true (footnote pointing out that the things don’t cut it – the things make true S(x)—not (S(x))Address why there are some statements that arent logical truths (eg substance predications) even though their true stories are structurally identical to those of logical truths, ie because of the relevance conditions.  1) substance predications have (should have if you think theres a difference) material truthmakers somehow.(ie, that they are necessary has witnesses – and not so for logical ones..) or…2) its not the business of TM theory to distinguish these..they are different but not bc of ontic conditionsCounterfactual truthsParadigm case: ‘If the glass fell, it would have broken’ Modal Realism With Metric: If we are prepared to countenance a plurality of worlds, and that there be some determinate metric between them, then the sample can be considered equivalent to the claim ‘On the closest possible worlds in which the glass fell, it broke’. The true story will then be about these worlds: it will account for the glass breaking on them, and for their being the closest worlds to the actual where this is the case. (Perhaps this story involves the closer worlds, too). This is a high price to pay, but if one is willing to pay it, there do not seem to be any internal considerations speaking against it. It is important that we not take for granted what the story is, for true statements about the distance between any two given worlds. In particular, is the metric something comparable to measures of spatial distance? Or ought we view it as something compatible with a form of Humean supervenience – simply an ordering based on intrinsic characteristics of the worlds? The distinction is very important from the perspective of true story realism. For if the metric is simply an arbitrary ordering, with nothing in the multiverse accounting for some genuine sense in which we might view it as privileged, then all the worlds in the multiverse do not bring us any closer to a story which confirms our understanding of the genuine condition on the world that the truth of a counterfactual truth imposes. Thus, if one goes the route of modal realism, one should take it all the way: the metric must represent a strong ontological tie between worlds. Dispositions/Tendencies: If we wish to adhere to actualism, probably the best way to go is Dispositionalism. On this view, there are dispositions, things which presumably behave like other sorts of qualities. ‘If the glass fell, it would have broken’ will here be true because the glass has a disposition to break when it falls, or because glass-falling events tend to lead to glass-breaking events. One might wonder whether dispositions are necessarily, or only contingently, attributable to things. It is not inconceivable that an adequate theory of alethic modality be developed on the basis of an ontological theory of dispositions. A difficulty for this view is explaining the seeming possibility of aliens, entities that do not actually exist, but might have if certain conditions had been different.Ceteris Paribus Clauses: If we have already accepted a satisfactory theory of true stories for judgments involving alethic modality, then we might argue as follows: Lewis’ story (closest possible worlds) sounds elegant, precisely because it masks the crucial contextual parameter common to counterfactual conditionals. For, how would we specify exactly which are the closest possible worlds in which the glass fell? This step masks what is essentially no more than a ceteris paribus clause. The phrasing just means: in worlds where the glass fell, with all (or as many possible) other things being equal. It is more honest, therefore, to render counterfactuals in terms of alethic modality, and ceteris paribus clauses: ‘Necessarily, ceteris paribus, if the glass fell, it would have broken.’ We admit that the precise premise this clause represents will vary contextually, and we question theories of counterfactuals that render their true stories a formulaic matter, as what they mean and imply about the world is, in matter of fact, anything but formulaic. Propositions marked by vaguenessParadigm case: ‘That rock is a part of Mount Everest’ , said of a rock in the footlands of the mountain.Supervaluationism: To a supervaluationist, a vague predicate functions differently than a precise one does. Precise predications derive their true stories in uncontroversial ways (according to the paradigms sketched above, for example). A predication of a vague predicate is then true of something when all of the precise predications in a certain privileged class are true of it. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest ’ is true when every precisification of ‘Parts of Mount Everest’ ( a precise aggregate of molecules) is such that that rock is among them. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is false when the rock is among none of these collections. Last but not least, if the rock is a part of some, but not all, of these aggregates, then the statement ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is not a truth value bearer. However, the statement, ‘It is vague whether that rock is part of Mount Everest’ will then be true. Thus, true judgments involving vague predicates are universal quantifications, or conjunctions of them, and their true stories are a matter of the satisfaction of these (precise) universal quantifications. To the supervaluationist, vagueness is a matter of semantic laziness, and the title ‘Mt Everest’ is such that we have never bothered to specify determinately to which entity it belongs. Fair enough, but it is perhaps not as easy to hold this position with other cases of vagueness: ‘This molecule on the surface of my skin, is a part of me’. If there is something special about aggregates bearing intentionality, then a supervaluationist must navigate skillfully to avoid Peter Ungar’s Scylla and Charybdis: the problem of the many, and the nonexistence of persons. Another issue for the supervaluationist is explaining the relationship between the vague predicate ‘being a part of Mount Everest’ and the class of its precisifications. It has been argued that this too may be a vague matter, which leads to higher order vagueness: a statement like ‘It is vague whether that rock is a part of Mount Everest’ will itself lack a truth value. Onticism: The onticist holds, contrary to the supervaluationist, that vague entities populate the world – vague mountains, vague events, vague universals. The name ‘Mount Everest’ does precisely refer; it refers to a vague entitiy. The onticist faces a number of problems in articulating the specifics of such a view. Can vague objects stand in precise relations? Can precise objects stand in vague relations? Does the incoherency of vague identity render the general position incoherent? It would not be fair to dismiss the view outright. Among other things, (provided one is able to handle the above questions) it allows one to hold that there is only one entity, Mount Everest, relevant to predications of parthood involving it, and that the truth of these parthood attributions or assertions that they are vague, are made true directly by this object. Whether or not a vague case, eg, ‘That rock is a part of Mount Everest’ will itself have a truth value, is presumably a matter of the specific breed of onticism one upholds.Epistemicism: The epistemicist agrees with the onticist that titles like ‘Mt Everest’ denote, and with the supervaluationist that the world harbors no vague entities. The epistemicist holds that these names do in fact select precise entities – just that we do not know which ones they are. This view has many advantages from a logical point of view. There is, in fact, no such thing as vagueness, from the perspective of how the world is. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is in every case either true or false – but we do not know which. Thus, true stories of these judgments, for the epistemicist, are very simple matters, following the basic paradigms outlined above. There is but one qualifiation: we generally do not know precisely what these true stories are.Many Values: Many value theorists, and degree theorists, hold that there may be degrees of truth between 0 and 1. Simons has suggested that, along these lines, we consider degrees of truthmaking.Arithmetical truthsParadigm cases: ‘7+5=12’, ‘ ‘7+5=12’ is a theorem of Peano Arithmetic’, ‘Peano Arithmetic is consistent’, ‘Every set has a well-ordering’, ‘ (1=2(0’logicismformalismplatonismintuitionismstructuralism (in re and ante rem)Conclusion.

In that case, a construction like a Rigid Definite Description must be used, a definite description that can only possibly refer to some particular entity, or nothing at all. (E!Pegasus := (y. Pegasizes(y)) While the judgment does entail the existence of the indexically specified liquid, the existence of this liquid does not entail the truth of the judgment: it could have been coloured. Further, while a statement expressed as logically atomic may in fact fail to express a truth-value bearing proposition, in considering ontologically basic propositions (hence, true ones) we circumvent the issues pertaining to truth value gaps. A Totalizer is a certain sort of fact: it is a fact that a given class of facts is the class of all atomic facts. [Armst 97] See footnote 6 We hold that no open formulas are propositions. Thus if ( is expressed by: ‘__ is a man,’ then ( is not a proposition. So for the relevant ( = ‘(x. (’ to be a proposition, is for x to be the only variable potentially free in (. Thus we speak of the bound pronoun (generally ‘it’, as in: Everything is such that it runs). It is possible to extend this schema to the infinite case, in the obvious way: If C is an extensional class, p a judgment, such that p is true if and only if every element of C exists, then if every element in C exists and p is true, if ( is the cardinality of C, then C TM( p. Unless one holds that this is not a presuppositional use of names. In this case, the truth is genuinely necessary: ie, is true no matter what. (In terms of conditions for its truth: there simply arent any) In Armstrong’s paper, „Difficult cases in the Theory of Truthmaking“ he claims that, if S(x) is a true predication such that it is made true by x, then, since x necessitates S(x), it must also be true that x necessitates (S(x). We do not think this follows. In any case, the corresponding formal argument is clearly invalid. [Ungar 80] [Ungar 86] [Evans 78]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	  

Truthmaker Theory as an Empirical EnterpriseA theory of truthmaking is a necessary component of any realist metaphysical theory that seeks to account for the role of language in the world. Every coherent realist position, after all, must account for our ability to make true assertions about reality. In its most general form, the demand for a theory of truthmaking is a demand for a serious account of this aboutness. Quine says: ‘To be is to be the value of a bound variable.’ We go further and say: to be is to play a role in the true story of some true sentence. 	What we mean by ‘true story’ will become clear in stages. It means more, first of all, than a long list of statements of the form:[A] ‘P’ is true if and only if P,though like good followers of Tarski we accept that any coherent theory of truthmaking must be compatible with the truth of all statements on such a list. It means more, too, than a long list of statements of the form:[B] ‘P’ is true if and only if it is the case that P.[B] and its variants:			[B(]	‘P’ is true if and only if the state of affairs that P obtains[B(]	‘P’ is true if and only if the fact that P obtainsprovide very simple templates for telling the true story about every single truth. But they can serve this purpose only if we accept an ontological picture of the world as comprehending some sort of totality of facts or states of affairs – in other words as containing special, proposition-shaped entities precisely (and oh so conveniently) tailored to do the job of making true. Ontology as we conceive it is a hard business, and there is no easy route to establishing what sorts of entities are involved in making true sentences (judgments, beliefs, propositions) of given sorts. The entities in question should be such that we have independent reasons for supposing them to exist – above all reasons derived from science or from those of our common-sense pre-theoretical intuitions which make science possible. The best theories of truthmaking will then rest on the view that the components of reality responsible for truthmaking are entities of already familiar sorts: tables, photons, surgical procedures and handshakes. II. The True StoryNot every true sentence has a truthmaker, but every true sentence has a true story. We reject truthmaker maximalism. That is, we hold that it is a mistake to define truth by means of:For any proposition P, P is true := P has a truthmaker.We accept that there are many sentences whose truth seems to be ‘made’ (in the sense of established and not caused) by the existence of certain objects. But it is just as clear to us that there are many sentences whose truth is a matter of (as we might loosely express it) enitities of given sorts not existing or not bearing certain characteristics. The truth of ‘Mario exists’ is a matter of Mario’s existing. The truth of ‘There does not exist a golden mountain’ is a matter of there not being anything that is both a mountain and made of gold. In this essay we give a precise definition of the truthmaker relation between a truth and an entity. We isolate a special class of true judgments: those that have truthmakers. We then give an inductive description – what we call a true story – of the ways that true judgments not in this basic class come to be true. Our goal is to show that the truth of every true judgment can be shown to be a matter of either (i) that judgment falling in the class of those judgments that are made true, or (ii) of there being a recursive account of the truth of that judgment, formulable in terms of its analytic relation to judgments in that special class, in such a way that each judgment can be assigned a certain node within a tree of derivations from judgments in the basic class. Telling true stories is harder than the followers of Tarski have encouraged us to believe, however, because the business of establishing where a given truth falls in this hierarchy is not itself a recursive: thus it is normally not something that can be read off from there mere logical form of a corresponding sentence.We stand for the thesis that every true judgment has a true story behind it. The work of our account shall not be the formulation of the tree of judgment types, but rather the piecemeal business of demonstrating empirically that true judgments of a succession of different sorts may each be shown to have a place on this tree. For this work, there are no easy formulae.The world is a messy place; too messy for there to be a simple algorithm that can tell us, given that the judgment is true, whether this is so because the judgment has truthmakers, or because it demands a true story of some other kind. Rather, we must proceed case by case, like empirical scientists, with no a priori guarantee of success. As we reject truthmaker maximalism, so we are sceptical of any position claiming to have a formula for generating the true story solely on the basis of the logical forms of the corresponding judgments. The hard cases are in part so hard precisely because it is difficult to establish what this logical form should be (consider: ‘John is unhappy’, ‘The whereabouts of the garden hose are uncertain’). In what follows, therefore, we take the responsibility of sketching the true stories of a representative sample of different judgment types. By successfully grappling, one by one, with the most difficult cases, we hope to demonstrate the practicability of our position. III. Necessitation and ProjectionThe goals of different truthmaker theorists are not entirely consistent with each other. What is the relationship between a truthmaker and truth conditions? Exactly what sort of “making” are we dealing with here? Are we merely searching for something whose existence ensures (necessitates) the truth of the relevant judgment, or do we wish for some condition of relevance as well, so that the truth of the relevant judgment likewise ensures the existence of its truthmaker? Here we defend a view which insists on the requirement of this extra relevance condition. We hypothesize that a serviceable theory of truthmaking, a theory which allows the formulation of true stories for true judgments of all types, is yielded by a theory of truthmaking as the “intersection of projection and necessitation,” a theory first described in [Smith 99], as part of the effort, there, to safeguard truthmaker theory against the arguments of Restall [Restall 96], which showed that truthmaker theories without relevance conditions would fall victim to slingshot arguments. Under this conception, for an entity x to be a truthmaker for a truth p is for it to satisfy the two conditions of Necessitation (x N p) and Projection (x P p), where these are defined as follows:(N) x N p := x exists and that x exists entails that por, in symbols: E!x ( ((( ( E! x ( ( p)(P) x P p := p and that p entails that x existsin symbols: p ( ((( ( p ( ( E!x). Projection is thus in a certain respect the dual of necessitation. Truthmaking itself can now be defined as follows: (TM) 	x TM p := x N p ( x P pWe might call this the P(N theory (pronounced to rhyme with ‘pun’). (N) captures the fundamental idea of truthmaker theory, that the truthmaker should necessitate the corresponding truth. (P) captures the additional factor of relevance – it ensures, in conjunction with (N), that a truth which has a truthmaker is about its truthmaker. The P(N theory is not without its weak points. In some cases it may seem to yield too few truthmakers. According to P(N, a generic existential claim such as ‘There are rabbits’ does not have individual rabbits as its truthmakers. This is because, for every rabbit, (N) is satisfied, but (P) fails: it is never true of that rabbit that its particular existence is entailed by the judgment ‘There are rabbits’. On the other hand, for some judgments, the theory may seem to recognize too many truthmakers. Given any two things that are mutually existentially dependent, it is clear that one makes true a given proposition if and only if the other does. The problem here is not that there are multiple truthmakers for a single truth. It is a common doctrine among the friends of truthmakers that the truthmaking relation will, in general, be, not one-to-one, but many-to-many. The danger, rather, is that such mutual existential dependence will serve as a springboard to set out of action the constraint of relevance – allowing Restall’s argument for collapse to rear its ugly head once more. Thus, on certain readings of mutual existential dependence the north pole of a magnet will make it true that the south pole exists. And if one thinks that {Socrates} and Socrates are mutually existentially dependent, then one is compelled to accept that {Socrates} is a truthmaker for the proposition ‘Socrates exists’.	On our view, these are bullets worth biting. As realists, we take it that every proposition makes some demand on the world; it defines a certain way that reality must be. When reality meets, or fits, this condition, then the proposition is true. Our concept of truthmaking does the following job: it isolates those cases where the condition consists exactly in the demand that some specific entities exist. In fact, it follows from our definition that for any x, y and p such that x TM p and y TM p, x and y entail each others’ existence.  Thus, as a matter of course, cases of generic reference (‘There are rabbits’) do not have truthmakers among the corresponding particulars. Likewise, of course, if one thing exists, necessarily, exactly when another does, then to demand that one exists is to demand that the other does. So too, of course when thinking about Socrates we thereby do not of necessity also think about {Socrates}. But we are determining here what conditions in the world must obtain for a sentence to be true, and there is no reason why these should exactly coincide with associated conditions pertaining to the notion of relevance cognitively conceived.IV. Ontologically Basic PropositionsA good theory of truthmaking should concern itself not with logical but with ontological form. For a truth to be of ontologically basic form is for it to possess at least one truthmaker. The true story for each ontologically basic truth p is very simple. It is of the form, ‘p is made true by x’. We may write:OB(p) := (x. x TM pThe paradigmatic examples of ontologically basic truths will be those expressed by existence attribution sentences involving proper names, judgments of the form ‘Mario exists’. These sentences will be written as ‘E!(Mario)’, which is intended as shorthand for, ‘(x. x = Mario’. It is telling that the paradigmatic examples of ontologically basic truths are not of logically atomic form. Conversely, many examples of truths expressed by logically atomic sentences are not of ontologically basic form. ‘That liquid is colorless’, for example, although it takes the form of a simple predication, is in fact a judgment stating that the liquid in question lacks color properties. It is, as we might say, in virtue of the nonexistence of the latter that the judgment is true. As already noted, there is no simple algorithm which enables us to determine which syntactic forms can correspond to judgments of ontologically basic form. On the other hand, however, the definition has one monumental advantage over that of ‘logical atomicity.’ The latter is a relative notion, in the sense that one judgment may be expressed both as a logically atomic proposition, and as a logically complex proposition (‘x is colorless’ for example, may be expressed both as ‘Colorless(x)’ and ‘(Colored(x)’). As Frege observed, there is no such thing as the logical form of any given natural language expression. The notion of the ontologically basic is in contrast absolute: no matter how a judgment is expressed, its ontologically basic or non-basic status remains the same. The inductive hierarchy we propose will be constructed by finding first of all the (representative examples of) basic truths, and then, for all other truth-value bearing judgments, an ontological form that is (ideally at least) likewise invariant under different logical regimentations of the judgments in question. V. On Truthvalue BearersIn line with our eschewal of a conception of the world as peopled by proposition-shaped entities, we eschew also commitment to the existence of abstract propositions themselves. Truthvalue bearers (truthbearers, for short) are declarative utterances, either written, performed, mentally judged, or perhaps, simply believed. We use the terms ‘judgment’ and ‘proposition’ interchangeably to mean ‘truthvalue bearer’. When we use the term ‘sentence’ we wish to remain neutral as to truthbearing capacity. VI. The Ontologically Complex‘That was a kiss of Mary by John’, said while pointing to the happy couple in their moment of embrace, if true, is ontologically basic. It indexically refers to a specific event. That event, call it k, is an instance of the universal kissing, and it is existentially dependent on both John and Mary. The ‘that’ functions rigidly, like a proper name. Therefore, the truth of the sentence implies the existence of this particular event, just as the existence of the event implies the relevant truth.	‘John is kissing Mary’, said for example while speculating about what is going on in the house down the street, is not ontologically basic. For, whereas the existence of the relevant k would entail its truth, the converse does not hold: it is not the case that ‘John is kissing Mary’ entails that k exists. Thus it turns out that many ordinary material relational attributions, though standardly regimented as logically atomic, are ontologically complex. In particular, as Frank Ramsey and Donald Davidson saw, they often host an existential quantifier: they are true if and only if there is some event of the relevant sort. 	‘John is not kissing Mary’, likewise, is not ontologically basic. Some have argued that it is the totality of what John is doing right now, or the totality of goings on across the earth, combined with the fact that this is indeed the totality of all goings on, or perhaps with the fact that some select subset of goings on rules out or excludes that John is kissing Mary right now. We shall see that these contrivances are superfluous. To use the helpful (if ontologically dispensable) terminology of possible worlds: the goal of truthmaker theory is to find precisely what condition is common exclusively to those worlds on which the given judgment is true. For ontologically basic truths, this condition is simply the existence of some entity (or of some group of entities). For the rest, the condition may be more complex. When we examine all of those worlds on which the proposition ‘John is not kissing Mary’ is true, we find the following to be that exclusive condition: These are all worlds, and all of the worlds, on which there exists no event which is a present-moment kissing of Mary by John.There is no object whose existence is precisely what a world needs in order for a “negative fact judgment” to be true. Even factualists (e.g. Armstrong) – holders of the view according to which there exist particularized entities called facts – face this problem insofar as they hope to make true every negative judgment by means of a “Totalizer”  since different possible worlds contain different totalized sets of positive facts. Truthmaker maximalism comes at the price of a very weak definition of ‘truthmaker’, one that cannot make the distinction between the ontologically basic and the non-complex. 	Another important group of ontologically complex judgments are general truths such as: ‘All swans are white.’ This judgment is true at a world if and only if every swan there is white. Which swans are white changes from world to world. Again, we see that there is no particular entity (a certain congregation of swans, perhaps) whose existence is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the judgment. It is at a point like this that one could be tempted toward factualism: the view that there exist particularized entities called facts, that, for example, ‘All swans are white’ is true if and only if there exists the fact that all swans are white. In the sequel, we illustrate how one may avoid this tendency. It may be true that assertions like ‘there are facts’and ‘such-and-such is a fact’ can be informative and meaningful. Yet these constructions should not lead us to the view that facts are particularized entities, any more than the meaningfulness of ‘John went for Mary’s sake’ should lead us to a view of particularized sakes. Fact-constructions are redundancies. ‘It is a fact that all swans are white’ is just a pretty way of asserting ‘all swans are white’. At least, nothing is added to the ontological analysis. In the sequel, we show how to combine this intuition with semantic realism, in the context of a theory of true stories.VII. The True Story (Tarskian Part)Without further ado, we present our general account. The account we give is modal, but it is not formulated in the terminology of possible worlds. Rather, we take the modal notion of necessity as primitive. Likewise, we take as primitive what it is for something to exist. This latter point requires us to look briefly at the issue of rigid designation and of how to handle non-denoting terms. Some judgments, in particular, modally qualified attributions (‘Pegasus might have been’) and negations of existential attributions (‘Pegasus does not exist’) may be true, even when the putative entity putatively named does not exist. For the vast majority of sentences, however, it is desirable to hold that existential presuppositions are being made by those who make the corresponding judgments: all entities named in a judgment must exist, in order for that judgment to be true. For Mario to fail to be hungry, he must first exist. In our account, existential presuppositions are the only form of presupposition it is necessary to consider. 	For each arbitrary proposition (, there is a true story for ( if and only if ( is true (a true story is always true). The conditions for different types of judgments are given in the following clauses, which should be interpreted against the background of the general requirement that all existential presuppositions are satisfied. If ( is ontologically basic: There exists a truthmaker for ( .If ( is the negation of a true proposition (: There is no true story for (.If ( is the disjunction of propositions ( and (: There is a true story either for ( or for (.If ( is a proposition of the form, ‘Everything is such that (’ (i.e., if ( may be regimented as ‘(x. (’ ): There is a true story for every proposition obtained by substituting the name of some existing entity for the bound pronoun in (. It is tempting to think of a true story as itself a judgment. This must not be taken too seriously, for circularity’s sake. Rather, there is a true story (and we may truly judge, ‘there is a true story’, and truly tell the related story) precisely when the world satisfies a certain condition – precisely the condition laid out in the clauses above. This is a subtle business. What we are claiming here is that ‘John is not kissing Mary’ is true precisely when the world lacks any entity meeting the description ‘a present-moment kissing of Mary by John’. It is true when the world is such that no present kiss of Mary by John is to be found on it. Negative conditions and general conditions of this sort may be met, by a world, without the existence of negative or general facts.As emphasized above, this inductive structure of the “truth type” of a given true judgment, is only the framework, in the most general sense, in which we tell true stories. There is nothing inductive about the manner in which we demonstrate that all true judgments will have true stories. Rather, this is an empirical claim. The remainder of our task shall be to justify it empirically, case by case. VIII. CasesHere is a list of cases we shall address (possibly with some overlap)Singular Existentials Standard predications of necessary intrinsicsStandard predications in the category of accident Standard extrinsic relational sentencesContingent formal predicative and relational sentences, intrinsic relational sentencesParadigmatic negative and totalizer sentencesIdentity statementsLogical truthsAlethic modalities Counterfactuals Propositions marked by vagueness Arithmetical truths Time-indexed truthsSingular existentialsParadigm case: ‘John exists’.These cases are the most uncontroversial examples of ontologically basic propositions that we can provide. They are true if and only if the entity to which existence is attributed does in fact exist. It is important to consider the negations of these statements. Can they be true? If so, questions about the nature of naming and reference are raised. There are both presuppositional and non-presuppositional uses of names. To hold, as we do, that negations of singular existentials are sometimes true, is to hold that these involve a non-presuppositonal use of names. One means of accounting for this, as mentioned in footnote 4, is to treat names in such cases as rigid definite descriptions. Incidentally, a true rigid definite description predication follows the paradigm of the predications in category 2).Standard predications of necessary intrinsicsParadigm cases: ‘John is a man’, ‘This experience is mine’Both of these cases are ontologically basic. If one is a man, then one is necessarily a man. Thus, if it is true that John is a man, then this is a fact that follows him thoroughout modal space, and will therefore be true if and only if John exists (Aristotle’s predications in the category of substance are included here). Likewise, an experience of mine is necessarily an experience of mine, and the associated judgment will be true if and only if the experience exists. On the negative side, ‘John is not a man’, if true, is ontologically basic (and if false, is necessarily false), for the same reason as in the previous cases. This furthers the case for the distinction between logical and ontological form. Standard predications in the category of accidentParadigm cases: ‘John is hungry’, ‘John is running’The first case involves the existence of a state or quality of being hungry, the second the existence of a process of running. In both cases the entities in question are existentially dependent on a certain substantial bearer, namely John. The standard cases here turn out in fact to be ontologically complex: they are existentially quantified and assert (generically) the existence of some state, quality or process satisfying a certain description, rather than asserting (rigidly) the existence of some particular event. 	4) Standard extrinsic relationsParadigm case: ‘John is kissing Mary’These cases, too, involve an event (here, a kiss, or kissing event) whose existence necessitates the truth of the relevant judgment, though in standard cases it is only that a trope of that sort exist, that is entailed by the truth of the judgment. These standard cases are then ontologically basic: they are existential generalizations of ontologically basic judgments. 5a) Contingent intrinsic predicationsParadigm cases: ‘John’s height is 5( 3(’, ‘That fingernail is a part of Agata’s finger’, ‘Loretta is located in Lausanne (at the present moment)’.Like predications of necessary intrinsics, these are cases that seem to be true purely as a matter of the way the relata are, which is to say that nothing further than the existence of the things themselves seems to be required in order for these sentences to be true. However, the judgments here are not contingently necessarily (necessarily true if true in fact). Rather, they are straightforwardly contingent: Agata could have cut her nails yesterday, John could have eaten more spinach, and Loretta could have vacationed in Interlaken, instead. Yet it seems bizarre to say that there are extra particulars in the world, making true the parthood relation of Agata’s nail to Agata, the property of John of having height of measure 5(3(, or the location relation between Loretta and Lausanne.In fact, however, the judgments at issue are ontologically basic and the entities that do the truthmaking work, here, are not bizarre at all. We hold a theory of events according to which events are in high degree rigid beings: they have almost all of their properties essentially. If the Titanic had sunk an hour later than it did, then the event referred to by the description ‘the sinking of the Titanic’ would have been a different entity from the event that is in fact referred to by that description, and likewise if a different iceberg had been involved, or if the ship had sunk in a different region of the Atlantic. This rigidity is peculiar to events. Objects like people and ocean-liners are such that their lives could have been filled with different events than those which actually occur. The Titanic could have made it to America. John had oranges for lunch, but he could have had bananas instead. Thus we say that a certain event being a part of a life is a contingent matter. But what is contingent is not that the event was a part of the life (which is itself an extended event). Rather, it is contingent that this particular extended event, including an eating-of-oranges incident yesterday, was John’s life, that this particular collision and tragedy was the (conclusion of the) history of the Titanic.Lives (like John’s, or the history of the Titanic) are kinds of events, determinately filled regions of spacetime. They correspond to what are popularly called the ‘spatiotemporal worms’ whose instantaneous temporal parts exactly overlap, in succession, those substances whose lives they are supposed to be. If x is John’s life, then x is roughly: the maximal event in which John is the exclusive participant. John’s life is existentially dependent on John. Crucially, as with all events, the converse is not true. John could have lived differently. His life would then have been different, though John would still have been himself.This is the key to the true stories of judgments of the given sort. Among the essential properties of John’s life are its spatial location and material composition at every instant during which it exists. John’s life is therefore precisely the entity we need to make true the predications of formal measurement properties, contingent parthood relations, and so on.	‘John’s height is 5( 3(’ may be viewed as a conjunction. Let L name the entity which is John’s life. Then the predication may be read as: ‘L involves a 5( 3( height at its now-slice, and L is John’s life’. L, on our account, makes both conjuncts true. We can think of John’s life as a relational moment, in Husserl’s sense, connecting John to his height at each successive instant.5b) Intrinsic relational sentences	Paradigm case: ‘Mary is taller than John’These are judgments whose truth is a matter of necessary relations between the relata or attributes of the relata. Judgments of this sort are ontologically complex and their true stories are inductively based on the cases described in 5a). Intrinsic relations are marked by the absence of any relational moment – an entity existentially dependent on both relata. As such, there will in general be no one entity both necessitating and projected by the relevant judgment, and it is for this reason that these judgments are ontologically complex. Some have spoken of letting pairs, tuples and the like, serve as truthmakers in cases such as this. On such a view, if {a, b} were the relevant pair, with with this pair itself playing the truthmaker role. We hold that pairs are like states of affairs – they are spurious reflections of corresponding linguistic forms; thus it is preferable to avoid a commitment to pairs as entities. In particular, we do not recognize anything in the meaning of ‘the existence of the pair a and b’ other than the assertion, ‘both a and b exist’. This suggests one possible extension of the TM relation:{a,b} TM2 p iff  	a and b both exist, p is true, and (E!a & E!b) <=> p.However, nothing interesting will be gained in this way. Our motives are to be as precise as possible in accounting for exactly what ontological conditions correspond to the truth of a given sentence. And the ontological conditions that would be described by p if p has a TM2 “pair” truthmaker, are precisely the conditions that we would come to by treating p as an ontologically complex statement whose true story is the conjunction of the true stories for ‘E!a’ and ‘E!b’.‘Mary is taller than John’ is analytically equivalent to: ‘There is an x and a y such that x is the height of Mary (in feet, say), y is the height of John (also in feet), and x > y.’ Now, if the judgment is true, then the greater than relation between the two measurement values will be a necessary truth, and therefore will not affect the true story. For a necessary truth p, involving no entities other than x and y, either the existence of both relata is the true story of p, or p is true, as it were, automatically – the true story of p can be told, no matter how the world is. (We address this issue below.) Thus, whatever the true story is for the conjunction of the two height attribution predications will be the true story for the intrinsic relational sentence. And, to bring the point home: a height attribution predication, as we saw above, follows the paradigm of 5a). 	 Negative and totalizer sentences Paradigm cases: ‘John is not hungry’, ‘all rabbits are mammals’, ‘There are exactly six people in this room’These cases are ontologically complex. Indeed it was for them that the recursive picture we displayed earlier was painted. ‘John is not hungry’ is true when there is no true story to be told for ‘John is hungry’. If ‘John is hungry’ were true, its true story would be that there existed some hungriness state of John. Thus, the true story here is that there does not exist any hungriness state of John.‘All rabbits are mammals’ is true when, for every existing entity x, ‘x is not a rabbit or x is a mammal’ has a true story. Equivalently, it is true when there does not exist anything that is a rabbit and is not a mammal. Whether we view this as a general, or a negative, condition, is immaterial. For factualists, on the other hand, such cases constitute a major challenge: it is by no means straightforward that general facts just are negative facts.‘There are exactly six people in this room’ is analytically equivalent to the conjunction: ‘There are six mutually distinct people in this room, and there are not seven mutually distinct people in this room.’ The true story for the first conjunct will be the existence of six people each in the room and not identical to the five others. The true story for the second conjunct will be the nonexistence of seven people each in the room and not identical to the six others. The true story for the target statement is the story of both of the conjuncts taken together.Identity statements (synchronic)Paradigm cases: ‘Cicero is Tully’, ‘The morning star is the evening star’There are two ways we may read judgments of this sort, corresponding roughly to the de re/de dicto distinction. De re, this judgment asserts of the thing referred to by the name ‘Cicero’ that it is identical to the thing referred to by the name ‘Tully’. When true such a judgment is  under this analysis necessarily true (and when false necessarily false). It is either asserting of one thing that it is the same as itself, or asserting of two distinct things that they are identical. Here is another example of a difficulty in recognizing ontological form on the basis of syntactic properties: true de re identity statements are to be treated via the paradigm we have described for predications of necessary intrinsics, true non-identity statements via the intrinsic relational paradigm (if x ( y, then the existence of both x and y is necessary and sufficient for the truth of ‘x ( y’). For the de dicto reading it is more natural to consider examples using definite descriptions, rather than names. While it is true that the morning star is the same as the evening star, it is intuitively possible that these might have been different celestial bodies. More precisely, it is intuitively possible that these descriptions might have picked out distinct entities. In the de dicto paradigm, the statement ‘The morning star is the evening star’ is to be read as the assertion: ‘There is an x such that x is the morning star and x is the evening star’, and this kind of judgment should be familiar to our readers thus far: its true story is told whenever there is something, x, such that the true story of ‘x is the morning star and x is the evening star’ is told.Logical truthsParadigm cases: ‘Every entity either is or is not a man’, ‘John is hungry or John is not hungry’ ‘It is not the case that something is and is not a man’ ‘John is identical to John’(de re) In general these cases are ontologically complex. They are such that their true stories will always be tellable, no matter how it is with the world. This is modulated only by the occurrence of existential presuppositions. Thus, we might say that ‘John is hungry or John is not hungry’ is only true if John exists, because otherwise this statement (à la Evans) fails to express a proposition. But John’s existence certainly suffices: then, either ‘John is hungry’ or ‘John is not hungry’ will always have a true story. And for cases involving no such presupposition, the true story is, in every case, that a trivial condition is satisfied. These judgments are simply true no matter what. We concur with Wittgenstein: the logical constants do not represent.IX. Hard CasesHere we come to a sampling of cases where finding true stories becomes more difficult. From the perspective of truthmaker theory, we might say that there is an embarrassment of riches here: according as one’s ontological commitments vary on these issues (independent of the issue of truthmaking itself, and the demand that all truths have some true story), one may pick and choose the sorts of truthmakers, and true stories, one wishes to use. Our goal has been to argue for the general requirements for a theory of truthmaking and true stories, and to show by example that taking these requirements seriously in no way entails, or even suggests, that we treat ‘facts’ or ‘states of affairs’ as a privileged class of truthmaking particulars. Thus in what follows we outline some true story strategies one might pursue according to ones philosophical stripes. It suffices for our purposes to show that, in each case, there is at least one option available.Judgments of alethic modality These cases are particularly important to the true story realist, as true stories are told in terms of necessities: the mutual entailment between the judgment that x exists and a judgment p are the basis of the P(N theory and of the inductive hierarchy with P(N as its base. Thus far we have remained mostly silent on the characterization of this necessity. Which modal axioms are the true ones and which doxastic possibilities represent genuine metaphysical possibility? (That Fermat’s last theorem be false may have been a doxastic possibility, though it is not, and never was, logically possible.) Is there a distinction between the logically possible conceptual possibilities, and the metaphysical possibilities? If so – and presumably the logical conceptual possibilities are the wider notion – then how do we account for the difference between why a logical necessity is necessary and why a metaphysical necessity is? And this is not the only such distinction: there may be several degrees of force of necessity. There happens to be no Aleutian Islander in the room right now. It is necessary that there are no unicorns in the room right now. It is very necessary that nothing travels faster than the speed of light. It is very, very necessary that John could not have been a handshake. And it is very, very, very necessary that there are no round squares. Counterfactual truthsParadigm case: ‘If the glass had fallen, it would have broken’ Modal Realism With Metric: If we are prepared to countenance a plurality of worlds, and that there be some determinate metric between them, then the sample can be considered equivalent to the claim ‘On the closest possible worlds in which the glass fell, it broke’. The true story will then be about these worlds: it will account for the glass breaking on them, and for their being the closest worlds to the actual where this is the case. (Perhaps this story involves the closer worlds, too). This is a high price to pay, but if one is willing to pay it, there do not seem to be any internal considerations speaking against it. It is important that we not take for granted what the story is, for true statements about the distance between any two given worlds. In particular, is the metric something comparable to measures of spatial distance? Or ought we view it as something compatible with a form of Humean supervenience – simply an ordering based on intrinsic characteristics of the worlds? The distinction is very important from the perspective of true story realism. For if the metric is simply an arbitrary ordering, with nothing in the multiverse accounting for some genuine sense in which we might view it as privileged, then all the worlds in the multiverse do not bring us any closer to a story which confirms our understanding of the genuine condition on the world that the truth of a counterfactual truth imposes. Thus, if one goes the route of modal realism, one should take it all the way: the metric must represent a strong ontological tie between worlds. Dispositions/Tendencies: If we wish to adhere to actualism, probably the best way to go is dispositionalism. On this view, there are dispositions, things which presumably behave like other sorts of qualities. ‘If the glass fell, it would have broken’ will here be true because the glass has a disposition to break when it falls, or because glass-falling events tend to lead to glass-breaking events. One might wonder whether dispositions are necessarily, or only contingently, attributable to things. It is not inconceivable that an adequate theory of alethic modality be developed on the basis of an ontological theory of dispositions. A difficulty for this view is explaining the seeming possibility of aliens, entities that do not actually exist, but might have if certain conditions had been different.Ceteris Paribus Clauses: If we have already accepted a satisfactory theory of true stories for judgments involving alethic modality, then we might argue as follows: Lewis’ story (closest possible worlds) sounds elegant, precisely because it masks the crucial contextual parameter common to counterfactual conditionals. For, how would we specify exactly which are the closest possible worlds in which the glass fell? This step masks what is essentially no more than a ceteris paribus clause. The phrasing just means: in worlds where the glass fell, with all (or as many possible) other things being equal. It is more honest, therefore, to render counterfactuals in terms of alethic modality, and ceteris paribus clauses: ‘Necessarily, ceteris paribus, if the glass fell, it would have broken.’ We admit that the precise premise this clause represents will vary contextually, and we question theories of counterfactuals that render their true stories a formulaic matter, as what they mean and imply about the world is, in matter of fact, anything but formulaic. Propositions marked by vaguenessParadigm case: ‘That rock is a part of Mount Everest’, said of a rock in the footlands of the mountain.Supervaluationism: To a supervaluationist, a vague predicate functions differently than a precise one does. Precise predications derive their true stories in uncontroversial ways (according to the paradigms sketched above, for example). A predication of a vague predicate is then true of something when all of the precise predications in a certain privileged class are true of it. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest ’ is true when every precisification of ‘Parts of Mount Everest’ (every admissible portion of reality) is such that that rock is among them. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is false when the rock is among none of these collections. Last but not least, if the rock is a part of some, but not all, of these aggregates, then the statement ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is not a truth value bearer. However, the statement, ‘It is vague whether that rock is part of Mount Everest’ will then be true. Thus, true judgments involving vague predicates are universal quantifications, or conjunctions of them, and their true stories are a matter of the satisfaction of these (precise) universal quantifications. To the supervaluationist, vagueness is a matter of semantic laziness, and the title ‘Mt Everest’ is such that we have never bothered to specify determinately to which entity it belongs. Fair enough, but it is perhaps not as easy to hold this position with other cases of vagueness: ‘This molecule on the surface of my skin is a part of me’. If there is something special about aggregates bearing intentionality, then a supervaluationist must navigate skillfully to avoid Peter Ungar’s Scylla and Charybdis: the problem of the many, and the nonexistence of persons. Another issue for the supervaluationist is explaining the relationship between the vague predicate ‘being a part of Mount Everest’ and the class of its precisifications. It has been argued that this too may be a vague matter, which leads to higher-order vagueness: a statement like ‘It is vague whether that rock is a part of Mount Everest’ will itself lack a truth value. Onticism: The onticist holds, contrary to the supervaluationist, that vague entities populate the world – vague mountains, vague events, vague universals. The name ‘Mount Everest’ does precisely refer; it refers to a vague entity. The onticist faces a number of problems in articulating the specifics of such a view. Can vague objects stand in precise relations? Can precise objects stand in vague relations? Does the incoherency of vague identity render the general position incoherent? It would not be fair to dismiss the view outright. Among other things (provided one is able to handle the above questions) it allows one to hold that there is only one entity, Mount Everest, relevant to predications of parthood involving it, and that the corresponding assertions are made true directly by this object. Epistemicism: The epistemicist agrees with the onticist that titles like ‘Mt. Everest’ denote, and with the supervaluationist that the world harbors no vague entities. The epistemicist holds that these names do in fact select precise entities – just that we do not know which ones they are. This view has many advantages from a logical point of view. There is, in fact, no such thing as vagueness, from the perspective of how the world is. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is in every case either true or false – but we do not know which. Thus the true stories for these judgments are for the epistemicist very simple matters, following the basic paradigms outlined above. There is but one qualification: we generally do not know precisely what these true stories are.Many Values: Many-value theorists, and degree theorists, hold that there may be degrees of truth between 0 and 1. Simons has suggested that, along these lines, we consider degrees of truthmaking.Arithmetical truthsParadigm cases: ‘7+5=12’, ‘ ‘7+5=12’ is a theorem of Peano Arithmetic’, ‘Peano Arithmetic is consistent’, ‘Every set has a well-ordering’, ‘ (1=2(0’Time-indexed truthsParadigm cases: ‘Burali-Forti existed in 1895’, ‘Burali-Forti worked in Turin in 1887’, ‘Burali-Forti in 1887 was the same person as Burali-Forti in 1895’  Our letter variables range over judgments: token bearers of truth value (on which more below). We thus follow in the tradition of [Mulligan et al. 84, Smith 99] in adhering to the principles of hunter-gatherer ontology.  Under some readings, in fact, this definition engenders a new kind of liar sentence:= ‘A has no truthmaker’What is more, (A) is immune to standard treatments of the liar in terms of a language/metalanguage distinction. "Truthmaker Realism", Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 77 (3), 1999, 274–291. We just unpack the definitions: (x TM p ( y TM p) => (x N p ( y P p) =>( (E!x => p) ( (p => E!y)). In the paper ‘Truthmaker Realism’ Smith defined a refined version of the P(N theory which allowed the the mereological fusion of all actual rabbits to serve as truthmaker. One may wish to make the interpretation of ‘E!x’ even more idiosyncratic, if one is of the opinion that proper names must always refer. In that case, a construction like a Rigid Definite Description must be used, a definite description that can only possibly refer to some particular entity, or nothing at all. (E!Pegasus := (y. Pegasizes(y)) While the judgment does entail the existence of the indexically specified liquid, the existence of this liquid does not entail the truth of the judgment: it could have been coloured. Further, while a statement expressed as logically atomic may in fact fail to express a truth-value bearing proposition, in considering ontologically basic propositions (hence, true ones) we circumvent the issues pertaining to truth value gaps. A Totalizer is a certain sort of fact: it is a fact that a given class of facts is the class of all atomic facts. [Armst 97] See footnote 6 We hold that no open formulas are propositions. Thus if ( is expressed by: ‘__ is a man,’ then ( is not a proposition. So for the relevant ( = ‘(x. (’ to be a proposition, is for x to be the only variable potentially free in (. Thus we speak of the bound pronoun (generally ‘it’, as in: Everything is such that it runs). It is possible to extend this schema to the infinite case, in the obvious way: If C is an extensional class, p a judgment, such that p is true if and only if every element of C exists, then if every element in C exists and p is true, if ( is the cardinality of C, then C TM( p. The fuss about pairs is generally introduced in order to handle sentences like ‘a is a part of b.’ Pair-truthmaking – and its conjunctive true story equivalent – is however inadequate to this kind of case: in general, both a and b might exist but a not be a part of b. Unless one holds that this is not a presuppositional use of names. In this case, the truth is genuinely necessary: ie, is true no matter what. (In terms of conditions for its truth: there simply arent any) [Ungar 80] [Ungar 86] [Evans 78]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	  

Every coherent realist position, after all, must account for our ability to make true assertions about reality. In its most general form, the demand for a theory of truthmaking is a demand for a serious account of this aboutness. Quine says: ‘To be is to be the value of a bound variable.’ We go further and say: to be is to play a role in the true story of some true sentence. 	What we mean by ‘true story’ will become clear in stages. It means more, first of all, than a long list of statements of the form:[A] ‘P’ is true if and only if P,though like good followers of Tarski we accept that any coherent theory of truthmaking must be compatible with the truth of all statements on such a list. It means more, too, than a long list of statements of the form:[B] ‘P’ is true if and only if it is the case that P.[B] and its variants:			[B(]	‘P’ is true if and only if the state of affairs that P obtains[B(]	‘P’ is true if and only if the fact that P obtainsprovide very simple templates for telling the true story about every single truth. But they can serve this purpose only if we accept an ontological picture of the world as comprehending some sort of totality of facts or states of affairs – in other words as containing special, proposition-shaped entities precisely (and oh so conveniently) tailored to do the job of making true. Ontology as we conceive it is a hard business, and there is no easy route to establishing what sorts of entities are involved in making true sentences (judgments, beliefs, propositions) of given sorts. The entities in question should be such that we have independent reasons for supposing them to exist – above all reasons derived from science or from those of our common-sense pre-theoretical intuitions which make science possible. The best theories of truthmaking will then rest on the view that the components of reality responsible for truthmaking are entities of already familiar sorts: tables, photons, surgical procedures and handshakes. (2) The True StoryNot every true sentence has a truthmaker, but every true sentence has a true story. We reject truthmaker maximalism. That is, we hold that it is a mistake to define truth by means of:For any proposition P, P is true := P has a truthmaker.We accept that there are many sentences whose truth seems to be ‘made’ (in the sense of established and not caused) by the existence of certain objects. But it is just as clear to us that there are many sentences whose truth is a matter of (as we might loosely express it) enitities of given sorts not existing or not bearing certain characteristics. The truth of ‘Mario exists’ is a matter of Mario’s existing. The truth of ‘There does not exist a golden mountain’ is a matter of there not being anything that is both a mountain and made of gold. In this essay we give a precise definition of the truthmaker relation between a truth and an entity. We isolate a special class of true judgments: those that have truthmakers. We then give an inductive description – what we call a true story – of the ways that true judgments not in this basic class come to be true. Our goal is to show that the truth of every true judgment can be shown to be a matter of either (i) that judgment falling in the class of those judgments that are made true, or (ii) of there being a recursive account of the truth of that judgment, formulable in terms of its analytic relation to judgments in that special class, in such a way that each judgment can be assigned a certain node within a tree of derivations from judgments in the basic class. Telling true stories is harder than the followers of Tarski have encouraged us to believe, however, because the business of establishing where a given truth falls in this hierarchy is not itself a recursive: thus it is normally not something that can be read off from there mere logical form of a corresponding sentence.We stand for the thesis that every true judgment has a true story behind it. The work of our account shall not be the formulation of the tree of judgment types, but rather the piecemeal business of demonstrating empirically that true judgments of a succession of different sorts may each be shown to have a place on this tree. For this work, there are no easy formulae.The world is a messy place; too messy for there to be a simple algorithm that can tell us, given that the judgment is true, whether this is so because the judgment has truthmakers, or because it demands a true story of some other kind. Rather, we must proceed case by case, like empirical scientists, with no a priori guarantee of success. As we reject truthmaker maximalism, so we are sceptical of any position claiming to have a formula for generating the true story solely on the basis of the logical forms of the corresponding judgments. The hard cases are in part so hard precisely because it is difficult to establish what this logical form should be (consider: ‘John is unhappy’, ‘The whereabouts of the garden hose are uncertain’). In what follows, therefore, we take the responsibility of sketching the true stories of a representative sample of different judgment types. By successfully grappling, one by one, with the most difficult cases, we hope to demonstrate the practicability of our position. (3) Necessitation and ProjectionThe goals of different truthmaker theorists are not entirely consistent with each other. What is the relationship between a truthmaker and truth conditions? Exactly what sort of “making” are we dealing with here? Are we merely searching for something whose existence ensures (necessitates) the truth of the relevant judgment, or do we wish for some condition of relevance as well, so that the truth of the relevant judgment likewise ensures the existence of its truthmaker? Here we defend a view which insists on the requirement of this extra relevance condition. We hypothesize that a serviceable theory of truthmaking, a theory which allows the formulation of true stories for true judgments of all types, is yielded by a theory of truthmaking as the “intersection of projection and necessitation,” a theory first described in [Smith 99], as part of the effort, there, to safeguard truthmaker theory against the arguments of Restall [Restall 96], which showed that truthmaker theories without relevance conditions would fall victim to slingshot arguments. Under this conception, for an entity x to be a truthmaker for a truth p is for it to satisfy the two conditions of Necessitation (x N p) and Projection (x P p), where these are defined as follows:(N) x N p := x exists and that x exists entails that por, in symbols: E!x ( ((( ( E! x ( ( p)(P) x P p := p and that p entails that x existsin symbols: p ( ((( ( p ( ( E!x). Projection is thus in a certain respect the dual of necessitation. Truthmaking itself can now be defined as follows: (TM) 	x TM p := x N p ( x P pWe might call this the P(N theory (pronounced to rhyme with ‘pun’). (N) captures the fundamental idea of truthmaker theory, that the truthmaker should necessitate the corresponding truth. (P) captures the additional factor of relevance – it ensures, in conjunction with (N), that a truth which has a truthmaker is about its truthmaker. The P(N theory is not without its weak points. In some cases it may seem to yield too few truthmakers. According to P(N, a generic existential claim such as ‘There are rabbits’ does not have individual rabbits as its truthmakers. This is because, for every rabbit, (N) is satisfied, but (P) fails: it is never true of that rabbit that its particular existence is entailed by the judgment ‘There are rabbits’. On the other hand, for some judgments, the theory may seem to recognize too many truthmakers. Given any two things that are mutually existentially dependent, it is clear that one makes true a given proposition if and only if the other does. The problem here is not that there are multiple truthmakers for a single truth. It is a common doctrine among the friends of truthmakers that the truthmaking relation will, in general, be, not one-to-one, but many-to-many. The danger, rather, is that such mutual existential dependence will serve as a springboard to set out of action the constraint of relevance – allowing Restall’s argument for collapse to rear its ugly head once more. Thus, on certain readings of mutual existential dependence the north pole of a magnet will make it true that the south pole exists. And if one thinks that {Socrates} and Socrates are mutually existentially dependent, then one is compelled to accept that {Socrates} is a truthmaker for the proposition ‘Socrates exists’.	On our view, these are bullets worth biting. As realists, we take it that every proposition makes some demand on the world; it defines a certain way that reality must be. When reality meets, or fits, this condition, then the proposition is true. Our concept of truthmaking does the following job: it isolates those cases where the condition consists exactly in the demand that some specific entities exist. In fact, it follows from our definition that for any x, y and p such that x TM p and y TM p, x and y entail each others’ existence.  Thus, as a matter of course, cases of generic reference (‘There are rabbits’) do not have truthmakers among the corresponding particulars. Likewise, of course, if one thing exists, necessarily, exactly when another does, then to demand that one exists is to demand that the other does. So too, of course when thinking about Socrates we thereby do not of necessity also think about {Socrates}. But we are determining here what conditions in the world must obtain for a sentence to be true, and there is no reason why these should exactly coincide with associated conditions pertaining to the notion of relevance cognitively conceived.(4) Ontologically Basic PropositionsA good theory of truthmaking should concern itself not with logical but with ontological form. For a truth to be of ontologically basic form is for it to possess at least one truthmaker. The true story for each ontologically basic truth p is very simple. It is of the form, ‘p is made true by x’. We may write:OB(p) := (x. x TM pThe paradigmatic examples of ontologically basic truths will be those expressed by existence attribution sentences involving proper names, judgments of the form ‘Mario exists’. These sentences will be written as ‘E!(Mario)’, which is intended as shorthand for, ‘(x. x = Mario’. It is telling that the paradigmatic examples of ontologically basic truths are not of logically atomic form. Conversely, many examples of truths expressed by logically atomic sentences are not of ontologically basic form. ‘That liquid is colorless’, for example, although it takes the form of a simple predication, is in fact a judgment stating that the liquid in question lacks color properties. It is, as we might say, in virtue of the nonexistence of the latter that the judgment is true. As already noted, there is no simple algorithm which enables us to determine which syntactic forms can correspond to judgments of ontologically basic form. On the other hand, however, the definition has one monumental advantage over that of ‘logical atomicity.’ The latter is a relative notion, in the sense that one judgment may be expressed both as a logically atomic proposition, and as a logically complex proposition (‘x is colorless’ for example, may be expressed both as ‘Colorless(x)’ and ‘(Colored(x)’). As Frege observed, there is no such thing as the logical form of any given natural language expression. The notion of the ontologically basic is in contrast absolute: no matter how a judgment is expressed, its ontologically basic or non-basic status remains the same. The inductive hierarchy we propose will be constructed by finding first of all the (representative examples of) basic truths, and then, for all other truth-value bearing judgments, an ontological form that is (ideally at least) likewise invariant under different logical regimentations of the judgments in question. (5) On Truthvalue BearersIn line with our eschewal of a conception of the world as peopled by proposition-shaped entities, we eschew also commitment to the existence of abstract propositions themselves. Truthvalue bearers (truthbearers, for short) are declarative utterances, either written, performed, mentally judged, or perhaps, simply believed. We use the terms ‘judgment’ and ‘proposition’ interchangeably to mean ‘truthvalue bearer’. When we use the term ‘sentence’ we wish to remain neutral as to truthbearing capacity. (6) The Ontologically Complex‘That was a kiss of Mary by John’, said while pointing to the happy couple in their moment of embrace, if true, is ontologically basic. It indexically refers to a specific event. That event, call it k, is an instance of the universal kissing, and it is existentially dependent on both John and Mary. The ‘that’ functions rigidly, like a proper name. Therefore, the truth of the sentence implies the existence of this particular event, just as the existence of the event implies the relevant truth.	‘John is kissing Mary’, said for example while speculating about what is going on in the house down the street, is not ontologically basic. For, whereas the existence of the relevant k would entail its truth, the converse does not hold: it is not the case that ‘John is kissing Mary’ entails that k exists. Thus it turns out that many ordinary material relational attributions, though standardly regimented as logically atomic, are ontologically complex. In particular, as Frank Ramsey and Donald Davidson saw, they often host an existential quantifier: they are true if and only if there is some event of the relevant sort. 	‘John is not kissing Mary’, likewise, is not ontologically basic. Some have argued that it is the totality of what John is doing right now, or the totality of goings on across the earth, combined with the fact that this is indeed the totality of all goings on, or perhaps with the fact that some select subset of goings on rules out or excludes that John is kissing Mary right now. We shall see that these contrivances are superfluous. To use the helpful (if ontologically dispensable) terminology of possible worlds: the goal of truthmaker theory is to find precisely what condition is common exclusively to those worlds on which the given judgment is true. For ontologically basic truths, this condition is simply the existence of some entity (or of some group of entities). For the rest, the condition may be more complex. When we examine all of those worlds on which the proposition ‘John is not kissing Mary’ is true, we find the following to be that exclusive condition: These are all worlds, and all of the worlds, on which there exists no event which is a present-moment kissing of Mary by John.There is no object whose existence is precisely what a world needs in order for a “negative fact judgment” to be true. Even factualists (e.g. Armstrong) – holders of the view according to which there exist particularized entities called facts – face this problem insofar as they hope to make true every negative judgment by means of a “Totalizer”  since different possible worlds contain different totalized sets of positive facts. Truthmaker maximalism comes at the price of a very weak definition of ‘truthmaker’, one that cannot make the distinction between the ontologically basic and the non-complex. 	Another important group of ontologically complex judgments are general truths such as: ‘All swans are white.’ This judgment is true at a world if and only if every swan there is white. Which swans are white changes from world to world. Again, we see that there is no particular entity (a certain congregation of swans, perhaps) whose existence is necessary and sufficient for the truth of the judgment. It is at a point like this that one could be tempted toward factualism: the view that there exist particularized entities called facts, that, for example, ‘All swans are white’ is true if and only if there exists the fact that all swans are white. In the sequel, we illustrate how one may avoid this tendency. It may be true that assertions like ‘there are facts’and ‘such-and-such is a fact’ can be informative and meaningful. Yet these constructions should not lead us to the view that facts are particularized entities, any more than the meaningfulness of ‘John went for Mary’s sake’ should lead us to a view of particularized sakes. Fact-constructions are redundancies. ‘It is a fact that all swans are white’ is just a pretty way of asserting ‘all swans are white’. At least, nothing is added to the ontological analysis. In the sequel, we show how to combine this intuition with semantic realism, in the context of a theory of true stories.(7) The True Story (Tarskian Part)Without further ado, we present our general account. The account we give is modal, but it is not formulated in the terminology of possible worlds. Rather, we take the modal notion of necessity as primitive. Likewise, we take as primitive what it is for something to exist. This latter point requires us to look briefly at the issue of rigid designation and of how to handle non-denoting terms. Some judgments, in particular, modally qualified attributions (‘Pegasus might have been’) and negations of existential attributions (‘Pegasus does not exist’) may be true, even when the putative entity putatively named does not exist. For the vast majority of sentences, however, it is desirable to hold that existential presuppositions are being made by those who make the corresponding judgments: all entities named in a judgment must exist, in order for that judgment to be true. For Mario to fail to be hungry, he must first exist. In our account, existential presuppositions are the only form of presupposition it is necessary to consider. 	For each arbitrary proposition (, there is a true story for ( if and only if ( is true (a true story is always true). The conditions for different types of judgments are given in the following clauses, which should be interpreted against the background of the general requirement that all existential presuppositions are satisfied. If ( is ontologically basic: There exists a truthmaker for ( .If ( is the negation of a true proposition (: There is no true story for (.If ( is the disjunction of propositions ( and (: There is a true story either for ( or for (.If ( is a proposition of the form, ‘Everything is such that (’ (i.e., if ( may be regimented as ‘(x. (’ ): There is a true story for every proposition obtained by substituting the name of some existing entity for the bound pronoun in (. It is tempting to think of a true story as itself a judgment. This must not be taken too seriously, for circularity’s sake. Rather, there is a true story (and we may truly judge, ‘there is a true story’, and truly tell the related story) precisely when the world satisfies a certain condition – precisely the condition laid out in the clauses above. This is a subtle business. What we are claiming here is that ‘John is not kissing Mary’ is true precisely when the world lacks any entity meeting the description ‘a present-moment kissing of Mary by John’. It is true when the world is such that no present kiss of Mary by John is to be found on it. Negative conditions and general conditions of this sort may be met, by a world, without the existence of negative or general facts.As emphasized above, this inductive structure of the “truth type” of a given true judgment, is only the framework, in the most general sense, in which we tell true stories. There is nothing inductive about the manner in which we demonstrate that all true judgments will have true stories. Rather, this is an empirical claim. The remainder of our task shall be to justify it empirically, case by case. (8) CasesHere is a list of cases we shall address (possibly with some overlap)Singular Existentials Standard predications of necessary intrinsicsStandard predications in the category of accident Standard extrinsic relational sentencesContingent formal predicative and relational sentences, intrinsic relational sentencesParadigmatic negative and totalizer sentencesIdentity statementsLogical truthsTime-indexed truths Alethic modalities Counterfactuals Propositions marked by vagueness Arithmetical truthsSingular existentialsParadigm case: ‘John exists’.These cases are the most uncontroversial examples of ontologically basic propositions that we can provide. They are true if and only if the entity to which existence is attributed does in fact exist. It is important to consider the negations of these statements. Can they be true? If so, questions about the nature of naming and reference are raised. There are both presuppositional and non-presuppositional uses of names. To hold, as we do, that negations of singular existentials are sometimes true, is to hold that these involve a non-presuppositonal use of names. One means of accounting for this, as mentioned in footnote 4, is to treat names in such cases as rigid definite descriptions. Incidentally, a true rigid definite description predication follows the paradigm of the predications in category 2).Standard predications of necessary intrinsicsParadigm cases: ‘John is a man’, ‘This experience is mine’Both of these cases are ontologically basic. If one is a man, then one is necessarily a man. Thus, if it is true that John is a man, then this is a fact that follows him thoroughout modal space, and will therefore be true if and only if John exists (Aristotle’s predications in the category of substance are included here). Likewise, an experience of mine is necessarily an experience of mine, and the associated judgment will be true if and only if the experience exists. On the negative side, ‘John is not a man’, if true, is ontologically basic (and if false, is necessarily false), for the same reason as in the previous cases. This furthers the case for the distinction between logical and ontological form. Standard predications in the category of accidentParadigm cases: ‘John is hungry’, ‘John is running’The first case involves the existence of a state or quality of being hungry, the second the existence of a process of running. In both cases the entities in question are existentially dependent on a certain substantial bearer, namely John. The standard cases here turn out in fact to be ontologically complex: they are existentially quantified and assert (generically) the existence of some state, quality or process satisfying a certain description, rather than asserting (rigidly) the existence of some particular event. 	4) Standard extrinsic relationsParadigm case: ‘John is kissing Mary’These cases, too, involve an event (here, a kiss, or kissing event) whose existence necessitates the truth of the relevant judgment, though in standard cases it is only that a trope of that sort exist, that is entailed by the truth of the judgment. These standard cases are then ontologically basic: they are existential generalizations of ontologically basic judgments. 5a) Contingent intrinsic predicationsParadigm cases: ‘John’s height is 5( 3(’, ‘That fingernail is a part of Agata’s finger’, ‘Loretta is located in Lausanne (at the present moment)’.Like predications of necessary intrinsics, these are cases that seem to be true purely as a matter of the way the relata are, which is to say that nothing further than the existence of the things themselves seems to be required in order for these sentences to be true. However, the judgments here are not contingently necessarily (necessarily true if true in fact). Rather, they are straightforwardly contingent: Agata could have cut her nails yesterday, John could have eaten more spinach, and Loretta could have vacationed in Interlaken, instead. Yet it seems bizarre to say that there are extra particulars in the world, making true the parthood relation of Agata’s nail to Agata, the property of John of having height of measure 5(3(, or the location relation between Loretta and Lausanne.In fact, however, the judgments at issue are ontologically basic and the entities that do the truthmaking work, here, are not bizarre at all. We hold a theory of events according to which events are in high degree rigid beings: they have almost all of their properties essentially. If the Titanic had sunk an hour later than it did, then the event referred to by the description ‘the sinking of the Titanic’ would have been a different entity from the event that is in fact referred to by that description, and likewise if a different iceberg had been involved, or if the ship had sunk in a different region of the Atlantic. This rigidity is peculiar to events. Objects like people and ocean-liners are such that their lives could have been filled with different events than those which actually occur. The Titanic could have made it to America. John had oranges for lunch, but he could have had bananas instead. Thus we say that a certain event being a part of a life is a contingent matter. But what is contingent is not that the event was a part of the life (which is itself an extended event). Rather, it is contingent that this particular extended event, including an eating-of-oranges incident yesterday, was John’s life, that this particular collision and tragedy was the (conclusion of the) history of the Titanic.Lives (like John’s, or the history of the Titanic) are kinds of events, determinately filled regions of spacetime. They correspond to what are popularly called the ‘spatiotemporal worms’ whose instantaneous temporal parts exactly overlap, in succession, those substances whose lives they are supposed to be. If x is John’s life, then x is roughly: the maximal event in which John is the exclusive participant. John’s life is existentially dependent on John. Crucially, as with all events, the converse is not true. John could have lived differently. His life would then have been different, though John would still have been himself.This is the key to the true stories of judgments of the given sort. Among the essential properties of John’s life are its spatial location and material composition at every instant during which it exists. John’s life is therefore precisely the entity we need to make true the predications of formal measurement properties, contingent parthood relations, and so on.	‘John’s height is 5( 3(’ may be viewed as a conjunction. Let L name the entity which is John’s life. Then the predication may be read as: ‘L involves a 5( 3( height at its now-slice, and L is John’s life’. L, on our account, makes both conjuncts true. We can think of John’s life as a relational moment, in Husserl’s sense, connecting John to his height at each successive instant.5b) Intrinsic relational sentences	Paradigm case: ‘Mary is taller than John’These are judgments whose truth is a matter of necessary relations between the relata or attributes of the relata. Judgments of this sort are ontologically complex and their true stories are inductively based on the cases described in 5a). Intrinsic relations are marked by the absence of any relational moment – an entity existentially dependent on both relata. As such, there will in general be no one entity both necessitating and projected by the relevant judgment, and it is for this reason that these judgments are ontologically complex. Some have spoken of letting pairs, tuples and the like, serve as truthmakers in cases such as this. On such a view, if {a, b} were the relevant pair, with with this pair itself playing the truthmaker role. We hold that pairs are like states of affairs – they are spurious reflections of corresponding linguistic forms; thus it is preferable to avoid a commitment to pairs as entities. In particular, we do not recognize anything in the meaning of ‘the existence of the pair a and b’ other than the assertion, ‘both a and b exist’. This suggests one possible extension of the TM relation:{a,b} TM2 p iff  		a and b both exist, p is true, and (E!a & E!b) <=> p.However, nothing interesting will be gained in this way. Our motives are to be as precise as possible in accounting for exactly what ontological conditions correspond to the truth of a given sentence. And the ontological conditions that would be described by p if p has a TM2 “pair” truthmaker, are precisely the conditions that we would come to by treating p as an ontologically complex statement whose true story is the conjunction of the true stories for ‘E!a’ and ‘E!b’.The first sample case is analytically equivalent to: ‘There is an x and a y such that x is the height of Mary (in feet, say), y is the height of John (also in feet), and x > y.’ Now, if the judgment is true, then the greater than relation between the two measurement values will be a necessary truth, and therefore will not affect the true story. For a necessary truth p, involving no entities other than x and y, either the existence of both relata is the true story of p, or p is true, as it were, automatically – the true story of p can be told, no matter how the world is. (We address this issue below.) Thus, whatever the true story is for the conjunction of the two height attribution predications will be the true story for the intrinsic relational sentence. And, to bring the point home: a height attribution predication, as we saw above, follows the paradigm of 5a). ‘Loretta is located in Lausanne’ : Location is in fact a slightly trickier case, as there remain controversies in the philosophy of space. What is it, for something to be located somewhere? Luckily, we do not need to dleve very deep into this issue. It suffices for our purposes to note that, part and parcel of the rigidity of lives and histories is their position in spacetime. Unlike their more modally flexible brethren, location in spacetime is an essential feature of processes, which means that if Loretta is located in Lausanne, then the now-slice of her life stands relevantly related to the now-slice of Lausanne, and that both have their relevant location properties essentially. Negative and totalizer sentences: Paradigm cases: ‘John is not hungry’, ‘all rabbits are mammals’, ‘There are exactly six people in this room’We include these for perspicuity, as it is cases of these sorts for which the recursive picture we displayed earlier was painted. ‘John is not hungry’: This is true when there is no true story to be told for ‘John is hungry’. If ‘John is hungry’ were true, its true story would be that there existed some hungriness state of John’s. Thus, the true story here is that there does not exist any hungriness state of John’s.‘All rabbits are mammals’ : This is true when, for every existing entity x, ‘x is not a rabbit or x is a mammal’ has a true story. Equivalently, it is true when there does not exist anything that is a rabbit and is not a mammal. Whether we view this as a general, or a negative, condition, is immaterial. For factualists, on the other hand, this constitutes a major challenge: it is by no means straightforward that general facts just are negative facts.‘There are exactly six people in this room’ : This is analytically equivalent to the conjunction: ‘There are six mutually distinct people in this room, and there are not any seven mutually distinct people in this room.’ The true story for the first conjunct will be the existence of exactly six people each in the room and not identical to the five others. The true story for the second conjunct will be the nonexistence of any seven people each in the room and not identical to the six others. The true story for the target statement is the story of both of the conjuncts taken together.Identity statements (synchronic):Paradigm cases: ‘Cicero is Tully’, ‘The morning star is the evening star’There are two ways we may read judgments of this sort, corresponding roughly to the de re/de dicto distinction. De re, this judgment asserts of the thing referred to by the name ‘Cicero’ that it is identical to the thing referred to by the name ‘Tully’. When true (false), this judgment, under this analysis, is necessarily true (false). It is either asserting of one thing, that it is the same as itself, or asserting of two distinct things that they are identical. Here is another example of a difficulty in recogizing ontological form on the basis of syntactic properties: true de re identity statements are to be treated via the predication in of necessary intrinsics paradigm, false ones via the intrinsic relational paradigm (if x ( y, then the existence of both x and y is necessary and sufficient for the truth of ‘x ( y’). The second possibility is a de dicto reading. It is easier to consider examples using definite descriptions, rather than names. While it is true that the morning star is the same as the evening star, it is intuitively possible that these might have been different celestial bodies. More precisely, it is intuitively possible that these descriptions might have picked out distinct entities. In the de dicto paradigm, the statement ‘The morning star is the evening star’ is to be read as the assertion : ‘There is an x such that x is the morning star and x is the evening star’. And this kind of judgment should be familiar to our readers thus far: its true story is told whenever there is something, x, such that the true story of ‘x is the morning star and x is the evening star’ is told.Logical truthsParadigm cases: ‘Every entity either is or is not a man’, ‘John is hungry or John is not hungry’ ‘It is not the case that something is and is not a man’ ‘John is identical to John’(de re), In general, these cases are ontologically complex. They are such that their true stories will always be tellable, no matter how it is with the world. This is modulated only by the occurrence of existential presupposition. Thus, we might say that ‘John is hungry or John is not hungry’ is only true if John exists, because otherwise this statement fails to express a proposition. But John’s existence certainly suffices: then, either ‘John is hungry’ or ‘John is not hungry’ will always have a true story. And for cases involving no such presupposition, the true story is, in every case, that a trivial condition is satisfied. These judgments are simply true no matter what. We concur with Wittgenstein: the logical constants do not denote, and there is no condition in particular that the world must satisfy, in order for them to be true. 	Here we come to a sampling of cases where finding true stories becomes more difficult. From the perspective of truthmaker theory, we might say that there is an embarrasment of riches here: according as one’s ontological commitments vary on these issues (independent of the issue of truthmaking itself, and the demand that all truths have some true story), one may pick and choose the sorts of truthmakers, and true stories, one wishes to use. Our goal has been to argue for the general requirements for a theory of truthmaking and true stories, and to show by example that taking these requirements seriously in no way entails, or even suggests, that we treat ‘Facts’ or ‘States of affairs’ as a privileged class of particulars designed by God to make true all of our sentences, or any of them. Thus, in what follows we outline some main true story strategies one might pursue, according to one’s philosophical stripes. It suffices for our purposes to show that, in each case, there is at least one option available.Time-indexed truthsParadigm cases: ‘Burali-Forti existed in 1895’, ‘Burali-Forti worked in Turin in 1887’, ‘Burali-Forti in 1887 was the same person as Burali-Forti in 1895’ Strict Presentism: This view asserts that only the present exists, and there are no present truths about times other than the present: everything true ultimately is a truth exclusively about presently existing entities. The strict presentist may waver on whether putative truths about the past, such as the above examples, even have truth values. If so, they will presumably require interpretation as paraphases about the existence of things like certain sorts of evidence … current memories of Burali-Forti, documents in archives, etchings on the university walls with his signature. These pieces of evidence will presumably be the core of the true stories for the relevant sentences. Precisely what renders something evidence is crucial here: the strict presentist must convince us that the present character of things is all there is to our current conception of the past, and why for example it seems meaningful to say that the past could have been more than one way, with the present turning out exactly as it is.Permissive Presentism: like Kripkes modal realism (its problem : no truthmakers, compare with case of alethic modalities) – or witness truthmakers in the present –analogy to witness modal truthmakers. Issues about reference to the deceased and not yet born.A tensed TM relation, tensed true stories, and ways of viewing these. substances over timeentia successiva, slices of wormsd) and e) (SNAP and SPAN)Judgments of alethic modality These cases are particularly important to the true story realist, as true stories are told in terms of necessities: the mutual entailment between the judgment that x exists, and a judgment p, are the basis of the P(N theory, and the inductive hierarchy with P(N as its base. Thus far, we have remained mostly silent on the characterization of this necessity. Which modal axioms are the true ones, and which doxastic possibilities (that is, conceptual possibilities in the loose sense – that Fermat’s last theorem were false may have been a doxastic possibility, though it is not, and never was, logically possible) represent genuine metaphysical possibility? Is there a distinction between the logically possible conceptual possibilities, and the metaphysical possibilities? If so – and presumably the logical conceptual possibilities are the wider notion – then how do we account for the difference, ie, between why a logical necessity (possibility) is necessary (possible), and why a metaphysical necessity is? And this is not the only such distinction: there may be several degrees of force of necessity: There happens to be no Aleutian Islander in the room right now. It is necessary that there are no unicorns in the room right now. It is very necessary that nothing travels faster than the speed of light. It is very, very necessary that John could not have been a handshake. And It is very, very, very necessary that there are no round squares. modal realism (kripke …no truthmakers…Lewis, honest here, at least)modal properties of things. A contingency operator? Can we make this more plausible? Powers and tendencies of varying stregnth, zBprimitive category of truths (but this is awkwardly similar to states of affairs. To stress the difference, eg like the difference btw armstrongs particularized SOAs, and Nexii, would take us on a confusing tangent)how to handle aliensdifferent intensities of alethic necessity: broadly logical, metaphysical, nomic, subnomic ( no unicorns exist)jabs at the flaws in armstrongs modal truthmaker story? – at least, difference between somethings being made true intrinsically, and somethigns being necessarily true (footnote pointing out that the things don’t cut it – the things make true S(x)—not (S(x))Address why there are some statements that arent logical truths (eg substance predications) even though their true stories are structurally identical to those of logical truths, ie because of the relevance conditions.  1) substance predications have (should have if you think theres a difference) material truthmakers somehow.(ie, that they are necessary has witnesses – and not so for logical ones..) or…2) its not the business of TM theory to distinguish these..they are different but not bc of ontic conditionsCounterfactual truthsParadigm case: ‘If the glass fell, it would have broken’ Modal Realism With Metric: If we are prepared to countenance a plurality of worlds, and that there be some determinate metric between them, then the sample can be considered equivalent to the claim ‘On the closest possible worlds in which the glass fell, it broke’. The true story will then be about these worlds: it will account for the glass breaking on them, and for their being the closest worlds to the actual where this is the case. (Perhaps this story involves the closer worlds, too). This is a high price to pay, but if one is willing to pay it, there do not seem to be any internal considerations speaking against it. It is important that we not take for granted what the story is, for true statements about the distance between any two given worlds. In particular, is the metric something comparable to measures of spatial distance? Or ought we view it as something compatible with a form of Humean supervenience – simply an ordering based on intrinsic characteristics of the worlds? The distinction is very important from the perspective of true story realism. For if the metric is simply an arbitrary ordering, with nothing in the multiverse accounting for some genuine sense in which we might view it as privileged, then all the worlds in the multiverse do not bring us any closer to a story which confirms our understanding of the genuine condition on the world that the truth of a counterfactual truth imposes. Thus, if one goes the route of modal realism, one should take it all the way: the metric must represent a strong ontological tie between worlds. Dispositions/Tendencies: If we wish to adhere to actualism, probably the best way to go is Dispositionalism. On this view, there are dispositions, things which presumably behave like other sorts of qualities. ‘If the glass fell, it would have broken’ will here be true because the glass has a disposition to break when it falls, or because glass-falling events tend to lead to glass-breaking events. One might wonder whether dispositions are necessarily, or only contingently, attributable to things. It is not inconceivable that an adequate theory of alethic modality be developed on the basis of an ontological theory of dispositions. A difficulty for this view is explaining the seeming possibility of aliens, entities that do not actually exist, but might have if certain conditions had been different.Ceteris Paribus Clauses: If we have already accepted a satisfactory theory of true stories for judgments involving alethic modality, then we might argue as follows: Lewis’ story (closest possible worlds) sounds elegant, precisely because it masks the crucial contextual parameter common to counterfactual conditionals. For, how would we specify exactly which are the closest possible worlds in which the glass fell? This step masks what is essentially no more than a ceteris paribus clause. The phrasing just means: in worlds where the glass fell, with all (or as many possible) other things being equal. It is more honest, therefore, to render counterfactuals in terms of alethic modality, and ceteris paribus clauses: ‘Necessarily, ceteris paribus, if the glass fell, it would have broken.’ We admit that the precise premise this clause represents will vary contextually, and we question theories of counterfactuals that render their true stories a formulaic matter, as what they mean and imply about the world is, in matter of fact, anything but formulaic. Propositions marked by vaguenessParadigm case: ‘That rock is a part of Mount Everest’ , said of a rock in the footlands of the mountain.Supervaluationism: To a supervaluationist, a vague predicate functions differently than a precise one does. Precise predications derive their true stories in uncontroversial ways (according to the paradigms sketched above, for example). A predication of a vague predicate is then true of something when all of the precise predications in a certain privileged class are true of it. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest ’ is true when every precisification of ‘Parts of Mount Everest’ ( a precise aggregate of molecules) is such that that rock is among them. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is false when the rock is among none of these collections. Last but not least, if the rock is a part of some, but not all, of these aggregates, then the statement ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is not a truth value bearer. However, the statement, ‘It is vague whether that rock is part of Mount Everest’ will then be true. Thus, true judgments involving vague predicates are universal quantifications, or conjunctions of them, and their true stories are a matter of the satisfaction of these (precise) universal quantifications. To the supervaluationist, vagueness is a matter of semantic laziness, and the title ‘Mt Everest’ is such that we have never bothered to specify determinately to which entity it belongs. Fair enough, but it is perhaps not as easy to hold this position with other cases of vagueness: ‘This molecule on the surface of my skin, is a part of me’. If there is something special about aggregates bearing intentionality, then a supervaluationist must navigate skillfully to avoid Peter Ungar’s Scylla and Charybdis: the problem of the many, and the nonexistence of persons. Another issue for the supervaluationist is explaining the relationship between the vague predicate ‘being a part of Mount Everest’ and the class of its precisifications. It has been argued that this too may be a vague matter, which leads to higher order vagueness: a statement like ‘It is vague whether that rock is a part of Mount Everest’ will itself lack a truth value. Onticism: The onticist holds, contrary to the supervaluationist, that vague entities populate the world – vague mountains, vague events, vague universals. The name ‘Mount Everest’ does precisely refer; it refers to a vague entitiy. The onticist faces a number of problems in articulating the specifics of such a view. Can vague objects stand in precise relations? Can precise objects stand in vague relations? Does the incoherency of vague identity render the general position incoherent? It would not be fair to dismiss the view outright. Among other things, (provided one is able to handle the above questions) it allows one to hold that there is only one entity, Mount Everest, relevant to predications of parthood involving it, and that the truth of these parthood attributions or assertions that they are vague, are made true directly by this object. Whether or not a vague case, eg, ‘That rock is a part of Mount Everest’ will itself have a truth value, is presumably a matter of the specific breed of onticism one upholds.Epistemicism: The epistemicist agrees with the onticist that titles like ‘Mt Everest’ denote, and with the supervaluationist that the world harbors no vague entities. The epistemicist holds that these names do in fact select precise entities – just that we do not know which ones they are. This view has many advantages from a logical point of view. There is, in fact, no such thing as vagueness, from the perspective of how the world is. ‘That rock is part of Mount Everest’ is in every case either true or false – but we do not know which. Thus, true stories of these judgments, for the epistemicist, are very simple matters, following the basic paradigms outlined above. There is but one qualifiation: we generally do not know precisely what these true stories are.Many Values: Many value theorists, and degree theorists, hold that there may be degrees of truth between 0 and 1. Simons has suggested that, along these lines, we consider degrees of truthmaking.Arithmetical truthsParadigm cases: ‘7+5=12’, ‘ ‘7+5=12’ is a theorem of Peano Arithmetic’, ‘Peano Arithmetic is consistent’, ‘Every set has a well-ordering’, ‘ (1=2(0’logicismformalismplatonismintuitionismstructuralism (in re and ante rem)Conclusion.

In any case, the corresponding formal argument is clearly invalid. [Ungar 80] [Ungar 86] [Evans 78]                                                                                      	  
