  <p>This border was established as part of the Treaty of Maastricht in 1843 
    <br>
   with the creation of the two successor states of the Austrian and Spanish 
    <br>
   (Habsburg) Netherlands. In the area round Baarle (marked B in the above) 
    <br>
   it proved impossible to come to a definitive agreement. In place of a
   fixed <br>
   border (between border posts 214 and 215) each of 5732 parcels of    land 
   <br>
   had their nationality laid down separately. A portion of these    parcels 
 form <br>
   together the space of 20 Belgian exclaves (today's    Baarle-Hertog) lying 
   <br>
   spread around within the territory of the Dutch    Baarle-Nassau and separated 
   <br>
   by 5 kilometers from the Belgian motherland:    <br>

  <p><b><font size="+2">The Story of Baarle</font></b> <br>
   (compiled from various    sources) <br>
   Here is the story of the only enclave in the world consisting of    several 
 bits of territory belonging to two different countries. In short, here  
 is the story of BAARLE. History has left a territory composed of two   
municipalities, whose shape is unique, belonging partly to Holland and partly 
   to Belgium.   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are quite comfortable with this    situation,
 even though it raises so many complicated and difficult problems    that
even the most brilliant jurists are puzzled. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The    year of Baarle's founding is not known precisely. 
 Most likely, Baarle was one    of a number of prehistoric sites described 
 by Julius Caesar in 54 B.C. The    name appears for the first time in 992, 
 when Countess Hislondis donates    <br>
   her properties in the county of Strijen (where Baarle is situated) to
the     abbey of Thorn (in Limbourg, one of the 9 provinces of Belgium and
one  of the    provinces of Holland in the East). <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the    12th century, Godfrid of Schoten, 
 the Lord (Sieur, Seigneur), of Breda, owned    Breda Castle and the territory 
 south of the castle. His ancestors had bought    that territory (as a perpetual 
 and free land <br>
   ownership) from the ancestors    of Hendrik I, the Duke of Brabant.&nbsp; 
 In those days, however, many a    dispute concerning the ownership of the 
 land divided the Duke of Brabant and    Dirk VII, the Count of Holland. Probably
 under threat, Godfried gave the    territory to the Duke by grace of the
Charter of 1190. Nevertheless Duke Henry    gave the territory immediately 
back to Godfried, but in the form of a loan.    <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Godfried thereby acknowledged the Duke as the    proprietor, 
 and this caused the Count of Holland to declare in 1203 that he    renounced 
 his rights on the territory. To express his gratefulness towards    Godfried, 
 the Duke of Brabant added large sections of forest and torbieres    (dried 
 swamp with a deposit you can burn) to the property he had on loan,    territory 
 reviously not belonging to Godfried. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But    while lending the whole county of Breda to Godfried, 
 he kept for himself all    the inhabited parcels, which became BAARLE-HERTOG. 
 (Hertog = le Sieur Duc)    (not to be confused with the prefectoral town 
of Bar-le-Duc, Meuse, France).    He loaned another portion (non-inhabited 
parcels, some of which were    themselves enclaves surrounded by inhabited 
parcels) together with the    torbieres to the Sieurs de Breda, and thus to
their suzerains, the Counts of    Nassau. Later, the Duke lost all his right
upon this territory he did not own.    <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dating from that moment, a difference was born between 
    Baarle under theDuke of Brabant, and Baarle under the Count of Holland, 
 in the    Nassau family. The existence of BAARLE-NASSAU became a fact.  
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Peace of Munster of 1648 (one of the treaties 
    of Westphalia putting an end to the 30 Years War), it was decided that 
 the    portion of Baarle under the Count of Nassau should be added to the 
    "Generalitetslanden" (The United Provinces), because this part belonged 
 to the    Baronnie de Breda; and that the portion of Baarle beonging to the
   <br>
   Baronnie    de Turnhout, in Brabant, should be added to the South Netherlands 
 (the present    Belgium). <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is remarkable is that the partition of    the
territory  would not change across all succeeding historical events.    Neither
the Peace of Munster (signed in 1648 at the same time that the Treaty   
of Aix-la-Chapelle  acknowledged the <br>
   existence of the Northern United    Provinces), nor the foundation of
a  unitary Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815    after the gouvernment of
the  French Empire, nor even the uprising of the    Belgians in 1830 could
change  the situation. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Treaty    of Maastricht of 1843 delimited the boundary 
 between the Netherlands and    Belgium, but even then it was found impossible 
 to compromise on the territory    of Baarle. It was instead decided to leave 
 things as they stood,&nbsp; for it    was impossible to define the boundary 
 between boundary poles 214 and 215    (about 50 km). <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of defining a boundary, it was    accepted
that  the nationality of 5732 parcels be established one by one. A    part
of these  parcels constitute the (at least) twenty Belgian enclaves,    presently 
Baarle  Hertog, which are situated within the territory of the Dutch    municipality 
 of Baarle-Nassau. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They lie about five km    beyond the Belgian border,
 but there is also a small enclave of Baarle-Nassau    inside Belgium. <br>
   This bizarre situation has obviously led to a number of    difficulties. 
 A normalisation of the situation was often tried. Even now some    think 
the situation is bad and unbearable. <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The    inhabitants of Baale think otherwise. They do
 not want to lose their special    ambiance and they want to keep Baarle
as  it is now: Baarle-Nassauhertog, a    historically, geographically and
politically  peculiar village. Not only in    Europe - but in the whole world.
  <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A house is deemed to    be in the country where its 
front  door is located. This gave rise to some    problems in 1997 when the 
border  between Belgium and the Netherlands was    remeasured. In at least 
one case  a house would have had to move from Belgium    to the Netherlands. 
The inhabitants  did not want that to happen, but the    solution was simple: 
they moved the  front door of their house.    </p>
