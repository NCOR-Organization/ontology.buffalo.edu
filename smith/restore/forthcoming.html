Advisory Editor: Barry Loewer (Rutgers)</P>

<P>It has long been recognized that while Quantum Theory is a powerful and accurate instrment
for modelling and predicting micro-physical phenomena, it seems to describe a world which is
decidedly distant from the world we experience - the "real world". For example, it seems to
predict that macroscopic systems (e.g. cats) sometimes evolve into states in which ordinary
properties (e.g being alive/dead) are not well-defined and indeed that we (or our bodies)
sometimes occupy such states. The task of attempting to square quantum theory with "the real
world" is the problem of interpreting the theory. There are a number of recent proposals
including many worlds, many minds, hidden variable, and stochastic collapse theories which
have attracted philosophical attention. This issue of <EM>The Monist</EM> is devoted to the philosophical
problems which arise from trying to reconcile quantum theory with the real world and especially
to these recent proposals.<BR>

Advisory Editor: Michael Levine (University of Western Australia)</P>

<P>Many people who do not believe in a theistic God nonetheless believe that everything is part of
an all-inclusive divine unity. This issue examines the philosophical basis of pantheism.
Pantheism has been the classical religious alternative to theism, but are there grounds -
philosophical and religious - for believing that pantheism presents the genuine alternative to
theism that many contemporary non-theists think it does? Rather than focusing on particular
pantheists this issue addresses questions concerning the philosophical and religious viability of
pantheism. What exactly is pantheism? What kind of "unity" are pantheists claiming? What
formal or logical ideas are relevant to pantheism's central claim? Is contemporary scientific
theory relevant to pantheism? How can philosophical problems associated with theism be recast
in terms of pantheism, and can they be resolved? How might one practice pantheism and why
hasn't pantheism been institutionalized? Contributors will include James Cargile, John Leslie,
Timothy Sprigge and Robert Scharlemann.<BR>

Advisory Editors: Herbert Hrachovec (Vienna)

<P>Philosophy, like other intellectual disciplines, has been both constituted and constrained by the
media available for the production and exchange of ideas. It is the inventions of writing and
print which have made scholarly inquiry possible. And as for philosophy, some of its seemingly
perennial problems in fact arose as a consequence of the fact that living (spoken) language had
to be transformed into language fixed on paper. Writing created the isolated thinker, while also
allowing the time to think and to organize thoughts into lapidary form; but it could not be
interactive in the way that real-time conversation was, and certainly not among multiple
interlocutors. Electronic networks now offer new conceptual challenges, a new framework for
philosophy, perhaps even a new synthesis. This issue of <EM>The Monist</EM> will itself serve as an
experiment in new interactive methods of philosophical composition. <BR>

</STRONG>Advisory Editor: John Haldane (St. Andrews)</P>

<P>Thomism has always had the potential to exchange methods and ideas with other philosophical
traditions. In this century versions of transcendental and phenomenological Thomism have
developed out of encounters with Kantian and Husserlian thought. In English-language
philosophy, however, the main tradition has been analytical. The question, therefore, arises:
what forms of synthesis might result from interaction between analytic philosophy and the
thought of Aquinas and other scholastics? The best analytical work has been in the areas of
metaphysics; the philosophies of language, logic, mind and action; and moral and political
philosophy. These are also central concerns of Thomism.<BR>
This issue of <EM>The Monist</EM> will collect contributions that seek to combine in fruitful ways the
interests and methods of the two traditions. Contributors will include Brian Davies, Terence
Irwin, Norman Kretzmann, Hilary Putnam and Eleonore Stump. Those wishing to submit essays
for consideration should send papers of between 4,000 and 7,000 words (inclusive of footnotes
and bibliography) to John Haldane, Department of Moral Philosophy, University of St
Andrews, Fife KY16 9AL, Scotland.</P>

81:1 January 1998: <STRONG><A NAME="Secondary Qualities Generalized">Secondary Qualities Generalized</A></STRONG><BR>
Advisory Editor: Peter Menzies (Canberra)</P>

<P>In recent years a number of philosophers have argued that the concepts of the secondary
qualities represent a useful model for understanding other significant concepts. A secondary
quality concept is one which is rooted essentially in human responses: more precisely, a
statement that a secondary quality is exemplified by an object is a priori equivalent to a
statement that the object would elicit a distinctive response from a suitable human subject under
suitable conditions. It has been argued by Mark Johnston, John McDowell, Philip Pettit, Hilary
Putnam, and Crispin Wright, among others, that a whole range of concepts, including those of
value, intentionality, personal identity, modality, and meaning, can be usefully construed along
these lines, as generalised secondary quality concepts. The purpose of this issue is to examine
the truth of these claims and their implications for the more general philosophical issue of
realism.</P>

Advisory Editor: Timothy Williamson (Edinburgh)</P>

<P>The sorites paradox raises the philosophical problem of vagueness in its most intractable form.
If the successive removal of grains turns a heap into a non-heap, standard reasoning seems to
show that at some point the removal of one grain turned a heap into a non-heap, a conclusion
which many dislike. One can label the problem by saying that the vagueness of the distinction
between heaps and non-heaps is to blame. Many accounts treat vagueness as a semantic or
pragmatic phenomenon; others treat it as epistemic or ontological. The paradox cannot be
solved by means of a technical fix; what is needed is a philosophically well-motivated account
of the underlying nature of vagueness. Such an account may engage with wider issues about
deviance in logic, disquotational and verificationist theories of truth, and the idea that reality
itself is indeterminate. Historical discussion, for example of the sorites paradox in antiquity or
of the emergence of vagueness as a problem in early analytic philosophy, is also relevant.
Contributors will include Stephen Schiffer and Roy Sorensen.</P>

Advisory Editor: Peter Hare (Buffalo)</P>

<P>In recent years epistemological inquiry has gone in a bewildering variety of directions. This
issue of <EM>The Monist</EM> will address the question whether these myriad inquiries can be unified.
How far are the many types of epistemology trying to solve the same problems? In so far as the
same questions are being addressed, how far are the answers given compatible, how far are they
complementary? What sense can we make of the entire epistemological scene? What lessons
can be drawn of use in future inquiry? Papers submitted should focus on specific problems or
issues concerning relations between different types of epistemology.</P>

Advisory Editor: P. J. Phemister (Liverpool)</P>

<P>In this collection of essays, scholars familiar with the Leibniz corpus will treat this corpus, not
as an archive to be gleaned for purely historical information, but rather as a treasure chest of
ideas and views, some of which are as alive and relevant now as they were in the seventeenth
century. The contributors will make use of core Leibnizian concepts to shed fresh light on
current debates.  On some topics, for instance in modal logic and identity theory, the debt to
Leibniz has long been explicitly acknowledged. In other areas, the value of Leibniz's
contributions has only recently been recognised. For instance, current work on the nature of
space has shown that Leibniz's views can be fruitfully applied in a twentieth-century context.
Reappraisals of Leibniz's metaphysics of the mind and of the natural world have much to offer
to current debates also in the philosophy of mind, both with respect to the nature of the mind
and its relation to the body. Papers are invited on these and other areas of philosophy for which
Leibniz's work is pertinent. </P>

Advisory Editor: Giuseppe Longo (Paris)</P>

<P>Computer science largely originated from mathematical logic in the thirties and forties, and it
has to some degree retained - through logic - its links to philosophy. In the last few decades,
however, computer science has become a firmly established discipline in its own right. New
tasks of language- and system-design have meant that relevant areas of logic have been
revitalized: computability and proof theory, especially, but also category theory, universal
algebra and other areas of mathematics, as tools for semantics. Concrete problems have raised
new abstract challenges which go well beyond the logical frame at the basis of early computer
science. Thus the prevailing sequential view of logical reasoning seems no longer to be the core
paradigm for computing, and parallelism and concurrency, distributed or asynchronous systems
are affecting our understanding of both logic and computation.<BR>
It is time, then, to deepen our philosophical reflections on the methods, tools and aims of
computer science as this has grown out of a blend of mathematical developments and
engineering tasks. Logic in computer science has played the double role of foundation and tool.
How has this modified our views about the foundations of knowledge and deduction or our
understanding of constructive systems? Beyond logic, is mathematics or its philosophy affected?</P>

Advisory Editor: J. Claude Evans (St. Louis)</P>

<P>Thirty years ago there was widespread hostility between representatives of 'analytic' and
'continental' philosophy. Today, in contrast, there is some significant positive interest in the
work of thinkers such as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty in contemporary philosophy of mind
and in cognitive science. Yet even in these areas many philosophers still reject any positive
contribution by 'continental' thinkers, and many continental philosophers reject the attempts to
assimilate continental thinkers such as Heidegger to the concerns of analytic philosophy.<BR>
Against this background, <EM>The Monist </EM>calls for papers on the topic of "Continental Philosophy:
For and Against". The aim is to generate dialogue when this is appropriate, but also to
encourage fruitful confrontation. "Continental philosophy" can be defined broadly or more
narrowly, but in each case what is being attacked and what is being defended should be clearly
specified.</P>

Deadline for Submissions: July 1998<BR>
Advisory Editor: Nenad Miscevic</P>

<P>What is the proper place of ethnic, national or cultural identities within the network of
institutions and political and cultural organizations that shape our lives? Nationalism claims that
national identity should occupy the center-stage of political life, shaping the issues of state
sovereignty (secession), of distribution of public goods, and of the nature of the cultural life a
community may wish to create for itself. Different kinds of nationalisms differ as to the
normative strength and universality of their claims. <BR>
In this decade nationalism has been resurrected as an important political force, both in its
traditional guise (in Europe and Asia) and in its multi-culturalist reincarnations (in North
America). Yet philosophers have been less attentive to the phenomenon of nationalism than it
deserves, lagging in this respect behind both sociologists and political scientists. The present
issue of <EM>The Monist</EM> is intended to spur the discussion by bringing together contributions from
various political and even cultural backgrounds, including countries in which the issue of
nationalism is a burning political problem of much more than academic interest.<BR>
In order to focus the discussion we suggest that authors concentrate especially on the following
two topics:<BR>
   First, the very concept of nationalism: the long and arduous analytic task of delimiting the
domain and distingushing various forms of nationalist claims not least as to their factual
presuppositions, political content, normative strength, and universality. Understanding
nationalism is a first step towards coming to terms with it, and if there is any issue where the
lack of understanding is a clear impediment to intelligent political action, then nationalism is
certainly an issue of this sort.<BR>
Second, nationalism is an obvious test-case in the debate between liberals and communitarians.
The "ethno-national" community is an obvious candidate example of a non-voluntary
association of common origin, culture and language, i.e. of the kind especially popular with
contemporary communitarians. On the other hand, the nation is a modern variety of community
and it would perhaps not be very appealing to more traditionally oriented communitarian
thinkers who focus upon pre-modern kinds of community. How much prominence should
communitarians accord it, and how much weight can liberals grant to it? Which varieties of
nationalist (or multiculturalist) claims should be given credence and are there any that are
justified in the eyes of both liberals and communitarians? </P>

Deadline for Submissions: October 1998<BR>
Advisory Editor: Joelle Proust (Paris)

<P>Cognitive models of the mind are based on the assumption that a mind is an assemblage of
different sorts of functions, including those of extracting information from the environment,
representing this information in various formats, and storing and retrieving it according to
current needs and purposes. One way of learning more about the mind is to study variations and
impairments in mental functioning. Cognitive neuropsychology has developed successful
methods for exploring phenomena such as blindsight and aphasia. Cognitive psychopathology is
still in its infancy. Its goal is that of understanding the cognitive processes associated with
phenomena such as autism, schizophrenia, melancholy and depression. A wealth of new models
emerge, offering promising areas of investigation for philosophers. Issues relevant to
philosophical inquiry include the relations between perception, hallucination and judgment,
agency and the self, consciousness, rationality and belief dynamics in the deluded, the
understanding of other minds, and the control of action. Papers are invited on any of these and
related topics. They should reflect current developments, but in such a way as to be intelligible
to the general philosophical reader.<BR>

Deadline for Submissions: January 1999<BR>
Advisory Editor: Herbert Hochberg (Austin, Texas)</P>

<P>From the time of Bolzano there developed a tradition of realistic metaphysics that can be called
"the Austrian tradition." Rooted in Aristotelian and Scholastic ideas about thoughts and their
referents, this tradition flourished in the work of Brentano and his students and influenced the
analytic realism of  Russell and Moore in England and of the Uppsala School in Sweden. It
consistently opposed the psychologism that has come to permeate contemporary philosophy,
while recognizing the need to continue the phenomenological as well as the logical side of the
analytic tradition. Ironically, while the earlier analytic realists opposed Kantian and Hegelian
idealism, strains of idealism were  spawned by the later writings of Husserl and Wittgenstein, as
well as by the Neurath wing of the Vienna Circle. Today, as idealism spreads in the fashionable
variants of anti-realism, pragmatism, post-modernism, instrumentalism,  etc., realism in the
Austrian tradition can still provide a valuable alternative. This issue of <EM>The Monist</EM> is devoted to
papers on the history and the contemporary viability of analytic realism in logic and philosophy.</P>

Deadline for Submissions: April 1999<BR>
Advisory Editor: Penelope Maddy (Irvine)</P>

<P>The philosophy of applied mathematics begins with the age-old problem of how mathematics
comes to be so strikingly useful in science. Contemporary investigators address issues at
various levels, from metaphysical debates to more focused questions about particular uses of
mathematics. Examples of the former include debates over what the successful application of
mathematics tells us about mathematical ontology, over the relations between various levels of
mathematized science (e.g., between fundamental theory and engineering), over the nature of 
mathematical idealizations and over the question whether the apparent omnipresence of such
idealizations pushes us inevitably toward some form of anti-realism in the philosophy of science.
Examples of the latter include questions about the extent to which we can insist that our
treatments of physical phenomena use only 'well-behaved' mathematical representations, about
which applications of continuum mathematics are really 'smoothed out' versions of something
else, about the meaning of differential equations at various types of 'boundaries', and about
renormalization and related problems in classical and quantum theories. Both philosophers of
mathematics and philosophers of science are invited to contribute papers that will open up new
perspectives on these and other issues in the philosophy of applied mathematics.</P>
