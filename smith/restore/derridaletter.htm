<p>Sir,
<p>The University of Cambridge is to ballot on May 16 on whether M Jacques
Derrida should be allowed to go forward to receive an honorary degree.
As philosophers and others who have taken a scholarly and professional
interest in M Derrida's remarkable career over the years, we believe that
the following might throw some needed light on the public debate that has
arisen over this issue.

<p>M Derrida describes himself as a philosopher, and his writings do indeed
bear some of the marks of writings in that discipline. Their influence,
however, has been to a striking degree almost entirely in fields outside
philosophy in departments of film studies, for example, or of French and
English literature.
<p>In the eyes of philosophers, and certainly among those working in leading
departments of philosophy throughout the world, M Derrida's work does not
meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour.
<p>We submit that, if the works of a physicist (say) were similarly taken
to be of merit primarily by those working in other disciplines, this would
in itself be sufficient grounds for casting doubt upon the idea that the
physicist in question were a suitable candidate for an honorary degree.
<p>M Derrida's career had its roots in the heady days of the 1960s, and
his writings continue to reveal their origins in that period. Many of them
seem to consist in no small part of elaborate jokes and puns ("logical
phallusies" and the like) and M Derrida seems to us to have come close
to making a career out of what we regard as translating into the academic
sphere tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the Dadaists or of the concrete
poets.
<p>Certainly he has shown considerable originality in this respect. But
again, we submit, such originality does not lend credence to the idea that
M Derrida is a suitable candidate for an honorary degree.
<p>Many French philosophers see in M Derrida only cause for silent embarrassment,
his antics having contributed significantly to the widespread impression
that contemporary French philosophy is little more than an object of ridicule.
<p>M Derrida's voluminous writings in our view stretch the normal forms
of academic scholarship beyond recognition. Above all as every reader can
very easily establish for himself (and for this purpose any page will do)
his works employ a written style that defies comprehension.
<p>Many have been willing to give M Derrida the benefit of the doubt, insisting
that language of such depth and difficulty of interpretation must hide
deep and subtle thoughts indeed.
<p>When the effort is made to penetrate it, however, then it becomes clear,
to us at least, that, where coherent assertions are being made at all,
these are either false or trivial.
<p>Academic status based on what seem to us to be little more than semi-intelligible
attacks upon the values of reason, truth and scholarship is not, we submit,
sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished
university.
