<UL><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+3>Center for Legal Ontology</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>Preliminary Prospectus by
Barry Smith and David Koepsell</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>BACKGROUND</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In an age of rapid technological progress,
legislators, jurists and lawyers must grapple with constantly changing
domains of objects. The expansion of trading blocks and treaty organizations,
and the concomitant growth in importance of international law have subjected
the processes of law-making and enforcement to challenges of increasing
intensity. Legal systems have been forced to try to fit such things as
genetically engineered life forms, artificial intelligences, "virtual"
currencies, DNA fingerprinting, and the Internet into legal schemes which,
when initially developed, anticipated no such phenomena.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Legal schemes need to be continuously updated
in light of technological and other innovations. Given the myriad forces
at work in constraining legislation, revision is carried out primarily
in an ad hoc manner. The resultant legislation is in consequence marked
by a general failure to examine or develop categorical schemes, or ontologies,
of sufficient generality and robustness to comprehend both old and new
varieties of objects. Examples abound of new types of objects with which
the law has failed to come to grips in reasoned fashion. Do national boundaries
exist on the Internet? Are genetically engineered life forms <I>expressions,</I>
which ought to be afforded the protection of intellectual property law?
If so, are they expressions of the sort which may be patented, or are they
expressions of the sort which may be copyrighted? The answers to such questions
must reflect ethical, economic and other considerations. But the questions
themselves are ontological: they are questions about how given entities
are properly to be categorized, and the task of providing answers to such
questions can be aided through the development of legal-ontological theories,
theories of intellectual property law, of artefacts, and of biological
entities.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Courts and governments, insurance companies
and software publishers have been left to deal with such problems by trial
and error, often with much confusion and inconsistency amongst jurisdictions
as a result. Such confusion might to some degree be avoided through the
development and application of sophisticated techniques of analysis based
on interdisciplinary research: it is with the development and application
of such techniques that the proposed Center for Legal Ontology will be
concerned.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>LEGAL ENTITIES</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The importance of legal entities in our
everyday lives cannot be exaggerated. Rights, property, obligations, crimes,
contracts, patents, debts, insurance policies, parcels of real estate,
nation-states, biotopes and similar objects define the scope of accepted
behavior in all societies ruled by laws.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The discipline of applied ontology is a
new field, but it has already become recognized as an area of growing importance,
and ontological methods have already successfully been applied in the medical
and other fields. (See Andrew Frank, "Ontology: A Consumer's Point of View"
in the list of references below.) The importance of legal ontology has
especially been recognized in Europe, where the problems of conflicting
jurisdictions have become ever more pressing with the growth of the European
Union. A center for research in ontological engineering in the legal field
has been established also in Tilburg in the Netherlands (see Kralingen
1997) and Frank and his group in Vienna (see references below) are using
the tools of legal ontology to develop software designed to assist <I>inter
alia </I>in legal tracking and cataloguing of real estate titles and registration.
These same tools could be used to develop expert systems which could be
used in synchronizing laws amongst various nations or in drafting new legislation
which might accommodate new types of objects or social practices.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>NEW APPROACHES TO THE LAW</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The purpose of the Center for Legal Ontology
will be the examination and formulation of ontologies designed to be of
service in the formulation, revision and application of laws. Legal ontology
embraces every object with which the law is concerned, from bagels to battleships,
from acts of will to Acts of Parliament, all of which at some point come
to be the objects of legislation. The objects of our study will thus be
both legal entities (such as contracts and rights) and also other objects
which are the subjects of law-making (such as CD-ROMs, biotopes, broadcast
frequencies, nuclear weapons or genetically engineered mice). We believe
that new legislation, when guided by ontological analysis, can at least
to some degree alleviate the problems associated with the rapid introduction
of new technologies and other forms of social change.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the present document we emphasize especially
the practical implications of legal ontology. The success of John Searle's
recent book on <I>The Construction of Social Reality</I> (1996) indicates
that the theoretical importance of the field is now beginning to be recognized
among philosophers. Investigations of legal ontology are of importance
also for the cognitive sciences. For there are not only sophisticated legal
ontologies which are embodied in legal codes, but also "naive" legal ontologies
which guide our commonsensical understanding of laws, norms and rights.
This opens up the possibility of cross-cultural studies of legal ontologies,
studies which may be of practical importance for example in the resolution
of disputes concerning land rights in borderland areas, where the jurisdictions
of conflicting legal ontologies overlap. Smith and David Mark (Buffalo
NCGIA) are currently collaborating on a series of projects in the field
of geographic ontology (ontology of real estate, ontology of national boundaries,
ontologies of naive geography) which are in many ways complementary to
the areas of research of the proposed Center.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>THE CENTER FOR LEGAL ONTOLOGY</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To encompass the full scope of existing,
new and possible entities which can fall within the orbit of the law, the
Center for Legal Ontology will need to rely on contributions from a broad
range of academic and professional fields. The Center will enlist the cooperation
of lawyers, jurists, economists, accountants, geographers, anthropologists,
computer scientists, linguists, legislators and philosophers in examining
the categorization of existing objects and the development of legal categories
for the future.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This multidisciplinary venture will rely
upon the contributions of members of every field of study which depends
upon and seeks to shape law-making. International relations, banking, trade
and communications networking are fields which face problems which arise
from conflicting legal ontologies across international boundaries. When
laws are made and treaties are entered into without regard to ontology
and to coordination of ontologies, injustice and economic inefficiencies
may result.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>APPLIED ETHICS AND THE SCIENCE
OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Recently, applied ethics has emerged as
a nexus between academia and the professions. The rise of medical ethics
and of business and research ethics has shown the proscriptive power and
capacity for public acceptance of the practice of philosophy. We propose
that work in applied philosophy should now be extended further, to include
the ontological analysis of legally relevant domains of entities. By analyzing
existing legal categories from an ontological point of view, philosophers
can point the way to a better understanding of the domains of entities
with which the law must deal. It may in this way be in a position to point
to other sorts of defects in proposed legislation, or to propose remedies
or alternative frameworks.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>ENCOURAGING TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When legal systems fail to adapt to new
technologies, or when they attempt to fit new types of objects into existing
legal categories that are poorly conceived, economic inefficiencies often
result. Litigation slows economic development and the fear of costly litigation
keeps potential players out of the marketplace. Corporations which develop
new technologies must often wait for the legal system to adapt. Ontological
clarification may thus be one important tool by which the degree and the
profitability of technological innovation can be increased.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>EXAMPLES AND CASE STUDIES</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One domain of entities for which ontological
analysis is valuable is that of real property. Although real estate is
in dollar terms by far the largest industry in the United States, the various
and labyrinthine rules which govern it have never been subject to rigorous
analysis from the ontological point of view, in spite of the fact that
real estate represents a domain of objects for which contradictory treatments
abound among the laws of different states and nations.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Another example is that of intellectual
property. In practice, intangible property usually gets protection from
only one form of intellectual property law, but there are many examples
of overlapping protection. Mickey Mouse is protected by both Trademark
Law and Copyright Law. Databases may be protected by trades secret law
and Copyright. Celebrity photos may be covered by both copyright and state
privacy laws. Different aspects of a single product may be protected by
a copyright, a design patent, and a (utility) patent.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A third example is the classification of
various public or private lands and the assignment of various rights to
each. The ad hoc manner in which these categories have been created and
addressed has led to numerous battles in courts, and sometimes to literal
battles accompanied by violence (as in recent disputes regarding state
taxation of Indian businesses in upstate New York). To the degree that
systematic analysis and ontological clarification may resolve such problems,
lawyers, legislators and jurists may benefit from the work of the proposed
Center.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>ONTOLOGY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The work of the Center will have relevance
also for the design of legal software and for the development of expert
systems in the legal field. Detailed ontologies of the human body, of diseases,
and of symptoms were a necessary precondition for the design of software
in the medical field. Correspondingly detailed ontologies of legal entities
can be expected to play a similar role in the development of legal expert
systems.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>PURPOSES AND GOALS</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Center for Legal Ontology will bring
together diverse groups of academics and those involved practically in
the law-making process. It is hoped that a new collaboration between these
groups will emerge through the development of a network of researchers
trained in applying ontological principles to legal objects of different
sorts. The Center will serve to:</FONT>

</UL>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Center will engage in original research,
inquiring into new domains of objects and possible objects, for example
in the fields of artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. Academics
associated with the Center will expect to be called upon to offer detailed
analyses of proposed and existing legislation, through solicited articles,
private consulting and even congressional testimony.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Center for Legal Ontology will coordinate
a network of affiliated academics and professionals who will be solicited
to render analyses of particular legislation, of particular legal entities,
or of the legal implications of particular technological developments.
The Center will be the nexus between this network and the legislators,
lawyers and jurists who create and work with laws. The Center will also
publish a series of reports, targeted to specific legal issues and new
sorts of technological innovation, and will engage in consultancy with
other groups. It will work with software companies to develop expert systems,
research tools and aids for drafting legislation which will be of use to
lawyers and legislators.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=+1>INTERIM GOALS</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The authors of this prospectus have initiated
contacts with academics, legislators and legal practitioners with a demonstrated
interest in the field of legal ontology. In addition they are organizing
a major international conference entitled "Applied Ontology: A Farber Conference
on Law and Institutions in Society", for which some funding has been raised
through the SUNY's Conferences in the Disciplines program and through the
UB Department of Philosophy. (See: http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/farber.html)
This conference will take place in Buffalo on April 24 and 25, 1998. It
will feature a special symposium on Searle's <I>The Construction of Social
Reality</I>, with responses by the author. The conference will serve as
an opportunity to bring together a core group of interested parties from
throughout the world.</FONT>
