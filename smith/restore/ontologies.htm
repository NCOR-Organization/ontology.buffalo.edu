<b>Philosophical Ontology</b>
<br>Ontology as a branch of philosophy is the science of what is, of the
kinds and structures of the objects, properties and relations in every
area of reality. 'Ontology' in this sense is often used in such a way as
to be synonymous with 'metaphysics'. In simple terms it seeks the classification
of entities. Each scientific field will of course have its own preferred
ontology, defined by the field's vocabulary and by the canonical formulations
of its theories. Traditional (philosophical) ontologists have tended to
model themselves on these scientific ontologies, either by producing theories
which are like scientific theories but radically more general than these,
or by producing theories which represent a regimentation of scientific
theories or a clarification of their foundations. Philosophical ontologists
have more recently begun to concern themselves not only with the world
as this is studied by the sciences, but also with domains of practical
activity such as law, medicine, engineering, commerce. They seek to apply
the tools of philosophical ontology in order to solve problems which arise
in these domains.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Ontology and Information Systems</b>
<br>In the field of information processing there arises what we might call
the Tower of Babel problem. Different groups of data-gatherers have their
own idiosyncratic terms and concepts in terms of which they represent the
information they receive. When the attempt is made to put this information
together, methods must be found to resolve terminological and conceptual
incompatibilities. Initially, such incompatibilities were resolved on a
case-by-case basis. Gradually, however, it was realized that the provision,
once and for all, of a 'concise and unambiguous description of principal,
relevant entities of an application domain and their potential relations
to each other' (Schulze-Kremer 1997) would provide significant advantages
over the case-by-case resolution of incompatibilities.<sup><a href="#N_1_">
(1)</a></sup>
<p>This is because each group of data-gatherers would then need to perform
the task of making its terms and concepts compatible with those of other
such groups only once: by calibrating its results in the terms of the single
canonical description. The term 'ontology' is used by information scientists
to refer precisely to a canonical description of this sort or to an associated
classificatory theory. An ontology is a neutral and computationally tractable
description or theory of a given domain which can be accepted and reused
by all information gatherers in that domain.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Uses of Ontology</b>
<br>We can distinguish the following broad areas in which ontological methods
are currently being used in the way described:<sup><a href="#N_2_"> (2)</a></sup>
<blockquote>
<li>
<i>Knowledge engineering, knowledge representation, knowledge management,
knowledge sharing, knowledge integration. </i>Consider for example the
Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) developed by Mike Genesereth and associates
(Genesereth 1991), and the language developed Ontolingua on the basis of
KIF by Tom Gruber and his associates (Gruber 1995). KIF is designed as
a
framework for the interchange of knowledge among disparate programs and
which comprehends modules designed to allow the representation of, for
example, mathematical and physical information. The Ontolingua, the KIF
translation language, is used as a working tool for the construction of
medical ontologies, for example by the Ontology group of the Medical Informatics
Unit in Rome.</li>

<li>
<i>Information retrieval and extraction. </i>Consider for example the problem
of internet navigation, a problem which turns not least on the immense
diversity of sources from which internet content is derived. Here a common
ontology can in principle provide a means to tame this diversity in a way
which would involve not only producers but also the consumers of on-line
information (Guarino, Masolo and Vetere 1999).</li>

<li>
<i>Natural language translation. </i>One goal of applied information systems
ontology is the provision of an Interlingua, a common target language for
natural language translation which would alleviate the need to construct
ad hoc translators for each pair of natural languages by constructing for
each such language a single translator into the common target. Thus for
example the Semantic Networks Research Group (SNeRG) of the University
at Buffalo tackles the problem of natural language understanding via the
development of a computational agent that can perform common-sense reasoning.
(Rapaport, Shapiro and Wiebe, J. M. 1997)</li>

<li>
<i>Database design, conceptual modeling, information systems design, information
systems integration. </i>The Tower of Babel problem arises above all in
the realm of database construction. In constructing software tools for
merging large databases, it has proved fruitful to develop common ontologies
in terms of which divergent bodies of data derived from different sources
can be unified together into a single system. In any given field there
is characteristically a wide variety of databases using their own categories
for storing data objects. Different databases may use identical labels
but with different meanings; alternatively the same meaning may be expressed
via different names. Here again, ontologies are used to resolve these problems
by supplying a single explicit specification of the meanings and relations
involved in given application domains. If all databases are capable of
being calibrated in terms of a single ontology (a single consistent set
of category labels) then the prospect arises of leveraging the thousands
of person-years of effort that has been invested in creating separate database
resources in such a way as to create, in more or less automatic fashion,
integrated knowledge bases of a scale hitherto unimagined. On the other
hand, the obstacles standing in the way of the construction of such a single
ontology can be prodigious also. Consider the task of establishing a common
ontology which would provide a neutral and common framework for all descriptions
of historical facts (a common ontology for world history).</li>

<li>
<i>Enterprise integration. </i>Consider a large international banking corporation
with subsidiaries in different countries throughout the world. The corporation
seeks to integrate the information systems within its separate parts, to
make them intercommunicable. Here again a common ontology is needed in
order to provide a common framework of communication, and the provision
of such a common ontology is by no means an easy task, given that the objects
in the realms of finance, credit, securities, collateral and so on are
structured and partitioned in different ways in different cultures. (Smith
and Zaibert 1997) Or consider the work of the firm Ontek - short for 'ontological
technology' - of Laguna Beach, California, which employs ontologists in
the design of software systems to serve as 'white color robots' for the
performance of administrative tasks involved in the running of repair shops
for large aircraft maintenance. Such systems require ontologies embracing
within a single framework not only aircraft parts and functions, but also
the raw-materials and processes involved in repair, the times these processes
and sub-processes take, job-shop space and equipment, an array of different
types of personnel, as well as counterparts of the costs and other economic
properties of all of these entities, including costs of transport, storage,
and much much more.</li>

<li>
<i>Military applications. </i>Consider the problems which arise when military
units from different armies need to be integrated together into a single
force, or when militarily relevant information from different regional
and international sources needs to be coded within a single framework for
purposes of tactical or strategic planning or of risk evaluation. Consider
the problems which arise when cartographic data from different sources
needs to be integrated within a single automated system for missile targeting
or other purposes.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>Meanings of 'Ontology'</b>
<br>There is a certain tension between the philosophical understanding
of the term 'ontology' and the use of the term that is proliferating through
the information-processing world. For the philosopher, ontology is a theoretical
enterprise whose content remains the same independently of the language
which is used to express it. In the world of information systems, in contrast,
an ontology is a software artifact designed with a specific use and computational
environment in mind. Thus also it is constituted by a specific vocabulary
and programming environment. Moreover, the theoretical concerns of philosopher-ontologists
imply that they are attempting, in principle at least, to establish the
truth about the domain in question. The concerns of the ontological engineers
in the world of information systems, in contrast, lead to a neglect of
the standard of truth in favour of other, putatively more practical standards,
such as computational tractability. Again, philosopher-ontologists are
distinguished from ontological engineers by the fact that the former are
concerned with the things themselves (the objects, properties and relations,
the states, events and processes) within a given domain; the latter, in
contrast, are concerned much rather with languages, descriptions, or concepts,
and with software representations constructed in relation to a given domain,
or with representations in people's heads.
<p>A compromise position is provided by recent attempts to use ontological
methods derived from information science as a basis for the regimentation
of scientific knowledge in fields such as medicine, anatomy, genetics,
or pharmacology. The different branches of biology have long been afflicted
by nomenclature wars, and different communities of biologists use idiosyncratic
terms and concepts for representing biological information. The term 'gene',
for example, is associated with different meanings in the major international
genomic databases. The construction of ontologies in such fields can force
researchers to reconcile their different frameworks by requiring explicit
specifications of the meanings of fundamental concepts in a common vocabulary.
The methods employed for the construction of this common vocabulary and
for the formulation of appropriate translation rules will then be not only
those derived from biology proper, and from the software engineering world
of information systems, but also recognizably philosophical methods derived
from more traditional metaphysical concerns (methods illustrated for example
in the literature on the ontology of biological species).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Closed World Assumption</b>
<br>Ontology has been used by governments, for example in the design and
construction of new computerized systems of land registration in the post-communist
countries of Eastern Europe. Andrew Frank has distinguished in this connection
two types of ontology in the information systems domain. On the one hand
there are ontologies built to represent pre-existing aspects of reality.
Such
an ontology must reflect observable properties of the relevant portions
of reality and there must obtain substantial and systematic correlations
between reality and the model of reality which the ontology implies. On
the other hand there are <i>administrative information systems </i>where
there is no reality other than the one created through the system itself,
so that the system is, by definition, correct. Stock examples are provided
within the world of banking, 'where the only operations possible are the
ones built into the program and there is no attempt to model connections
to an independently existing external reality. The definition of a client
of a bank is "a person listed in the database of bank clients".' (Frank
1997) In such circumstances the ontologist can take advantage of a closed
world assumption (which is required, for example, in the construction of
a database query language). Without the closed world assumption, the ontologist's
job becomes harder and one obvious consequence of modeling an exterior
reality is that the closed world assumption is not valid any more.'
