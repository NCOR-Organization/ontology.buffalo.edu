<font size="+1">The application of ontology has thus far been confined almost
exclusively to the field of knowledge representation. Ontology has been
applied, for example, in the design of medical databases and in the construction
of <a href="http://www.geoinfo.tuwien.ac.at/persons/frank/publ/SCP.html">geographical
information systems</a>. One area which is naturally suited to ontological
analysis is that of the law and of social institutions in general.</font>

<p><font size="+1">Papers are invited for a conference to be held in Buffalo
on April 24th and 25th, 1998 on the topic of applied ontology, with special
reference to the law and social institutions. A special symposium will
be organized as part of the conference on John Searle's book <i>The Construction
of Social Reality</i>, with responses by the author.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">The deadline for submissions is January 1, 1998. Information
as to submission procedures is appended below. Further details can be obtained
from http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/farber, or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:ontology@acsu.buffalo.edu">ontology@acsu.buffalo.edu</a>,
or from: Farber Conference, Department of Philosophy, SUNY Buffalo, NY
14260-1010.</font>

</p><p><font size="+1">Applied ontology is a tool of untapped potential in the
realm of law-making. Examples of problem areas which might be addressed
at the conference include:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font size="+1">what is an ontology?</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of laws, norms and rules</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of speech acts</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of international law (secession, immigration,
citizenship, cross-cultural and comparative legal ontology)</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of land and real estate (law and naive geography)
the ontology of crime and punishment</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of environmental law</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of cyberspace and of intellectual property</font></li>

<li>
<font size="+1">the ontology of the human genome project (genetic patents,
genes as expressions)</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1">Legal systems are composed of legal entities, such as laws,
contracts, obligations, and rights. Their application yields new categories
of entities such as: corporations, trademarks, marriages, and parcels of
real estate. The categorization of these entities by different legal systems
has not, by- and-large, been conducted in ways which exploit the tools
of modern ontology. Consequently, contradictions and inconsistencies often
arise in the law when, for instance, one type of entity is forced into
two mutually exclusive categories (e.g., when software is considered both
patentable and copyrightable). Papers are invited which consider these
and related issues from a philosophical point of view.</font>
