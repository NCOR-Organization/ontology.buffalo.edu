A treaty was signed in the 1960s but implementation was held up by poor Indo-Pak 
relations, and court challenges by people in both countries. After Bangladeshi 
independence another treaty was signed in 1974, but again held up, particularly 
by Indian court challenges.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
The lease of the Tin Bigha corridor to Bangladesh, allowing access to its 
largest enclave Dahagram-Angarpota (which it was allowed to retain in 
compensation for giving up a claim on Berubari), was signed in 1982, but the 
corridor was not opened until 1992, and then only during alternate daylight 
hours (so as not to enclavise the Indian villages south of Dahagram, who were 
worried they would be cut off). By 2011 common-sense prevailed and the corridor 
was finally open 24 hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
Meanwhile nothing had occurred with regard to the other enclaves, despite 
Bangladesh constantly raising the matter with India.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
While the exchange is good news for the chhitmahalis, the people of the 
enclaves, it is a sad day for borders, because a 300-year old border, the 
world's most complicated, that pre-dated the British, will now be 'rationalised' 
as a result of India and Bangladesh being unable to work with each other, and 
live up to the example of their joint Mughal and British past. Frankly, the 
'problems' on the border were more a function of centralised government 
byzantine bureaucratism in both countries than of any real disharmony amongst 
neighbouring families in the enclaves. If local (civil) authorities had been 
given the power to sort out issues locally, instead of referring them up the 
chain to Delhi/Dhaka, and involving foreign ministries, military and other 
non-locals, I believe things problems could have been sorted out. By requiring 
central government to sign off on everything, it forced issues to be escalated 
(often violently) before anyone in either capital would care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
The enclaves provided a potential tourism drawcard for what is a peripheral 
region in both countries, giving opportunities for economic development that 
will now be lost [for the benefits of enclave tourism in otherwise peripheral 
regions, see the example of Baarle-Nassau on the Neth-Belgian border, which has 
many parallels, including the bloody war of independence of one country from the 
other, based on religious intolerance). Although the current thaw in relations 
appears to be moving forward on transit and other co-operations, which is good, 
I fear the enclave region will remain just another poor rice and jute growing 
area, and residents of both countries will remain separated even more 'securely' 
by India's border fence. The enclaves gave a window of opportunity to move 
beyond an us-and-them mentality in a region that for centuries before 1947 was 
united. While I am very happy that the enclave dwellers will now have access to 
their full rights as citizens, which will give them a certain economic boost, it 
is a loss all round for them, for the peoples of both countries, and for the 
world in general, that the two government have proved too blinkered by 
nationalism to grasp a unique opportunity to jointly develop the region, and 
prove harmony between their citizenries was possible. That the world will now 
lose its only counter-counter enclave, is as much a tragedy and as much an act 
of cultural vandalism as certain other such acts we have seen in recent months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
That a simple issue such as allowing transit to Indian lorries and train through 
Bangladesh to Assam has proved unimplementable, in a region which under the 
British was unified, is incredibly sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I only hope the enclave pillar won't be uprooted, so that daring tourists will 
still be able to trace the former boundary on foot, as they still can that of 
Moresnet , now in Belgium.</p>
