<A name=definitions></A>
<H3>Definitions</H3>
<H4>DEFINITION I</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The quantity of matter is the measure of the same, 
arising from its density and bulk conjointly.</SPAN></P>
<P>THUS AIR of a double density, in a double space, is quadruple in quantity; in 
a triple space, sextuple in quantity. The same thing is to be understood of 
snow, and fine dust or powders, that are condensed by compression or 
liquefaction, and of all bodies that are by any causes whatever differently 
condensed. I have no regard in this place to a medium, if any such there is, 
that freely pervades the interstices between the parts of bodies. It is this 
quantity that I mean hereafter everywhere under the name of body or mass. And 
the same is known by the weight of each body, for it is proportional to the 
weight, as I have found by experiments on pendulums, very accurately made, which 
shall be shown hereafter. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION II</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, 
arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly.</SPAN></P>
<P>The motion of the whole is the sum of the motions of all the parts; and 
therefore in a body double in quantity, with equal velocity, the motion is 
double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION III</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The<I> vis insita</I>, or innate force of matter, 
is a power of resisting, by which every body, as much as in it lies, continues 
in its present state, whether it be of rest, or of moving uniformly forwards in 
a right line.</SPAN></P>
<P>This force is always proportional to the body whose force it is and differs 
nothing from the inactivity of the mass, but in our manner of conceiving it. A 
body, from the inert nature of matter, is not without difficulty put out of its 
state of rest or motion. Upon which account, this <I>vis insita</I> may, by a 
most significant name, be called inertia (<I>vis inertiae</I>) or force of 
inactivity. But a body only exerts this force when another force, impressed upon 
it, endeavours to change its condition; and the exercise of this force may be 
considered as both resistance and impulse; it is resistance so far as the body 
for maintaining its present state, opposes the force impressed; it is impulse so 
far as the body, by not easily giving way to the impressed force of another 
endeavours to change the state of that other. Resistance is usually ascribed to 
bodies at rest, and impulse to those in motion; but motion and rest, as commonly 
conceived, are only relatively distinguished; nor are those bodies always truly 
at rest, which commonly are taken to be so. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION IV</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>An impressed force is an action exerted upon a 
body, in order to change its state, either of rest, or of uniform motion in a 
right line.</SPAN></P>
<P>This force consists in the action only, and remains no longer in the body 
when the action is over. For a body maintains every new state it acquires by its 
inertia only. But impressed forces are of different origins, as from percussion, 
from pressure, from centripetal force. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION V</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>A centripetal force is that by which bodies are 
drawn or impelled, or any way tend, towards a point as to a centre.</SPAN></P>
<P>Of this sort is gravity, by which bodies tend to the centre of the earth; 
magnetism, by which iron tends to the loadstone; and that force, whatever it is, 
by which the planets are continually drawn aside from the rectilinear motions, 
which otherwise they would pursue, and made to revolve in curvilinear orbits. A 
stone, whirled about in a sling, endeavours to recede from the hand that turns 
it; and by that endeavour, distends the sling, and that with so much the greater 
force, as it is revolved with the greater velocity, and as it is let go, flies 
away. That force which opposes itself to this endeavour, and by which the sling 
continually draws back the stone towards the hand, and retains it in its orbit, 
because it is directed to the hand as the centre of the orbit, I call the 
centripetal force. And the same thing is to be understood of all bodies, 
revolved in any orbits. They all endeavour to recede from the centres of their 
orbits; and were it not for the opposition of a contrary force which restrains 
them to, and detains them in their orbits, which I therefore call centripetal, 
would fly off in right lines, with an uniform motion. A projectile, if it was 
not for the force of gravity, would not deviate towards the earth, but would go 
off from it in a right line, and that with an uniform motion, if the resistance 
of the air was taken away. It is by its gravity, that it is drawn aside 
continually from its rectilinear course, and made to deviate towards the earth, 
more or less, according to the force of its gravity, and the velocity of its 
motion. The less its gravity is, or the quantity of its matter, or the greater 
the velocity with which it is projected, the less will it from a rectilinear 
course, and the farther it will go. If a leaden ball, projected from the top of 
a mountain by the force of gunpowder, with a given velocity, and in a direction 
parallel to the horizon, is carried in a curved line to the distance of two 
miles before it falls to the ground; the same, if the resistance of the air were 
taken away, with a double or decuple velocity, fly twice or ten times as far. 
And by increasing the velocity, we may at pleasure increase the distance to 
which it might be projected, and diminish the curvature of the line which it 
might describe, till at last it should fall at the distance of 10, 30, or 90 
degrees, or even might go quite round the whole earth before it falls; or 
lastly, so that it might never fall to the earth, but go forwards into the 
celestial spaces, and proceed in its motion <I>in infinitum</I>. And after the 
same manner that a projectile, by the force of gravity, may be made to revolve 
in an orbit, and go round the whole earth, the moon also, either by the force of 
gravity, if it is endued with gravity, or by any other force, that impels it 
towards the earth, may be continually drawn aside towards the earth, out of the 
rectilinear way which by its innate force it would pursue; and would be made to 
revolve in the orbit which it now describes; nor could the moon without some 
such force be retained in its orbit. If this force was too small, it would not 
sufficiently turn the moon out of a rectilinear course; if it was too great, it 
would turn it too much, and draw down the moon from its orbit towards the earth. 
It is necessary that the force be of a just quantity, and it belongs to the 
mathematicians to find the force that may serve exactly to retain a body in a 
given orbit with a given velocity; and <I>vice versa</I>, to determine the 
curvilinear way into which a body projected from a given place, with a given 
velocity, may be made to deviate from its natural rectilinear way, by means of a 
given force. </P>
<P>The quantity of any centripetal force may be considered as of three kinds: 
absolute, accelerative, and motive. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION VI</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The absolute quantity of a centripetal force is 
the measure of the same, proportional to the efficacy of the cause that 
propagates it from the centre, through the spaces round about.</SPAN></P>
<P>Thus the magnetic force is greater in one loadstone and less in another, 
according to their sizes and strength of intensity. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION VII</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The accclerative quantity of a centripetal force 
is the measure of the same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a 
given time.</SPAN></P>
<P>Thus the force of the same loadstone is greater at a less distance, and less 
at a greater: also the force of gravity is greater in valleys, less on tops of 
exceeding high mountains; and yet less (as shall hereafter be shown), at greater 
distances from the body of the earth; but at equal distances, it is the same 
everywhere; because (taking away, or allowing for, the resistance of the air), 
it equally accelerates all falling bodies, whether heavy or light, great or 
small. </P>
<H4>DEFINITION VIII</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The motive quantity of a centripetal force is the 
measure of the same, proportional to the motion which it generates in a given 
time.</SPAN></P>
<P>Thus the weight is greater in a greater body, less in a less body; and, in 
the same body, it is greater near to the earth, and less at remoter distances. 
This sort of quantity is the centripetency, or propension of the whole body 
towards the centre, or, as I may say, its weight; and it is always known by the 
quantity of an equal and contrary force just sufficient to hinder the descent of 
the body. </P>
<P>These quantities of forces, we may, for the sake of brevity, call by the 
names of motive, accelerative, and absolute forces; and, for the sake of 
distinction, consider them with respect to the bodies that tend to the centre, 
to the places of those bodies, and to the centre of force towards which they 
tend; that is to say, I refer the motive force to the body as an endeavour and 
propensity of the whole towards a centre, arising from the propensities of the 
several parts taken together; the accelerative force to the place of the body, 
as a certain power diffused from the centre to all places around to move the 
bodies that are in them; and the absolute force to the centre, as endued with 
some cause, without which those motive forces would not be propagated through 
the spaces round about; whether that cause be some central body (such as is the 
magnet in the centre of the magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the 
gravitating force), or anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design 
only to give a mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their 
physical causes and seats. </P>
<P>Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to the 
motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion arises from the 
celerity multiplied by the quantity of matter; and the motive force arises from 
the accelerative force multiplied by the same quantity of matter. For the sum of 
the actions of the accelerative force, upon the several particles of the body, 
is the motive force of the whole. Hence it is, that near the suffice of the 
earth, where the accelerative gravity, or force productive of gravity, in all 
bodies is the same, the motive gravity or the weight is as the body; but if we 
should ascend to higher regions, where the accelerative gravity is less, the 
weight would be equally diminished, and would always be as the product of the 
body, by the accelerative gravity. So in those regions, where the accelerative 
gravity is diminished into one-half, the weight of a body two or three times 
less, will be four or six times less. </P>
<P>I likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense, accelerative, 
and motive; and use the words attraction, impulse, or propensity of any sort 
towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another; considering 
those forces not physically, but mathematically: wherefore the reader is not to 
imagine that by those words I anywhere take upon me to define the kind, or the 
manner of any action, the causes or the physical reason thereof, or that I 
attribute forces, in a true and physical sense, to certain centres (which are 
only mathematical points); when at any time I happen to speak of centres as 
attracting, or as endued with attractive powers. </P><A name=scholium></A>
<H3>SCHOLIUM</H3>
<P>Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less known, 
and explained the sense in which I would have them to be understood in the 
following discourse. I do not define time, space, place, and motion, as being 
well known to all. Only I must observe, that the common people conceive those 
quantities under no other notions but from the relation they bear to sensible 
objects. And thence arise certain prejudices, for the removing of which it will 
be convenient to distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent, 
mathematical and common. </P>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=term>I. </SPAN>Absolute, true, and mathematical time, 
of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything 
external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent, and common 
time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of 
duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time; 
such as an hour, a day, a month, a year. </P>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=term>II. </SPAN>Absolute space, in its own nature, 
without relation to anything external, remains always similar and immovable. 
Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; 
which our senses determine by its position to bodies; and which is commonly 
taken for immovable space; such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an aerial, 
or celestial space, determined by its position in respect of the earth. Absolute 
and relative space are the same in figure and magnitude; but they do not remain 
always numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves, a space of 
our air, which relatively and in respect of the earth remains always the same, 
will at one time be one part of the absolute space into which the air passes; at 
another time it will be another part of the same, and so, absolutely understood, 
it will be continually changed. </P>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=term>III.</SPAN> Place is a part of space which a body 
takes up, and is according to the space, either absolute or relative. I say, a 
part of space; not the situation, nor the external surface of the body. For the 
places of equal solids are always equal; but their suffices, by reason of their 
dissimilar figures, are often unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor 
are they so much the places themselves, as the properties of places. The motion 
of the whole is the same with the sum of the motions of the parts; that is, the 
translation of the whole, out of its place, is the same thing with the sum of 
the translations of the parts out of their places; and therefore the place of 
the whole is the same as the sum of the places of the parts, and for that 
reason, it is internal, and in the whole body. </P>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=term>IV.</SPAN> Absolute motion is the translation of a 
body from one absolute place into another; and relative motion, the translation 
from one relative place into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative 
place of a body is that part of the ship which the body possesses; or that part 
of the cavity which the body fills, and which therefore moves together with the 
ship: and relative rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of the 
ship, or of its cavity. But real, absolute rest, is the continuance of the body 
in the same part of that immovable space, in which the ship itself, its cavity, 
and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is really at rest, 
the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really and absolutely move 
with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth. But if the earth also 
moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will arise, partly from the true 
motion of the earth, in immovable space, partly from the relative motion of the 
ship on the earth; and if the body moves also relatively in the ship, its true 
motion will arise, partly from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space, 
and partly from the relative motions as well of the ship on the earth, as of the 
body in the ship; and from these relative motions will arise the relative motion 
of the body on the earth. As if that part of the earth, where the ship is, was 
truly moved towards the east, with a velocity of 10,010 parts; while the ship 
itself, with a fresh gale, and full sails, is carried towards the west, with a 
velocity expressed by 10 of those parts; but a sailor walks in the ship towards 
the east, with I part of the said velocity; then the sailor will be moved truly 
in immovable space towards the east, with a velocity of 10,001 parts, and 
relatively on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of g of those parts. 
</P>
<P>Absolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from relative, by the equation 
or correction of the apparent time. For the natural days are truly unequal, 
though they are commonly considered as equal, and used for a measure of time; 
astronomers correct this inequality that they may measure the celestial motions 
by a more accurate time. It may be, that there is no such thing as an equable 
motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All motions may be accelerated 
and retarded, but the flowing of absolute time is not liable to any change. The 
duration or perseverance of the existence of things remains the same, whether 
the motions are swift or slow, or none at all: and therefore this duration ought 
to be distinguished from what are only sensible measures thereof; and from which 
we deduce it, by means of the astronomical equation. The necessity of this 
equation, for determining the times of a phenomenon, is evinced as well from the 
experiments of the pendulum clock, as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>As the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of the 
parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their places, and they 
will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out of themselves. For times 
and spaces are, as it were, the places as well of themselves as of all other 
things. All things are placed in time as to order of succession; and in space as 
to order of situation. It is from their essence or nature that they are places; 
and that the primary places of things should be movable, is absurd. These are 
therefore the absolute places; and translations out of those places, are the 
only absolute motions. </P>
<P>But because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from one 
another by our senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible measures of 
them. For from the positions and distances of things from any body considered as 
immovable, we define all places; and then with respect to such places, we 
estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from some of those 
places into others. And so, instead of absolute places and motions, we use 
relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common affairs; but in 
philosophical disquisitions, we ought to abstract from our senses, and consider 
things themselves, distinct from what are only sensible measures of them. For it 
may be that there is no body really at rest, to which the places and motions of 
others may be referred. </P>
<P>But we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from the 
other by their properties, causes, and effects. It is a property of rest, that 
bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And therefore as it is 
possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or perhaps far beyond 
them, there may be some body absolutely at rest; but impossible to know, from 
the position of bodies to one another in our regions, whether any of these do 
keep the same position to that remote body, it follows that absolute rest cannot 
be determined from the position of bodies in our regions. </P>
<P>It is a property of motion, that the parts, which retain given positions to 
their wholes, do partake of the motions of those wholes. For all the parts of 
revolving bodies endeavour to recede from the axis of motion; and the impetus of 
bodies moving forwards arises from the joint impetus of all the parts. 
Therefore, if surrounding bodies are moved, those that are relatively at rest 
within them will partake of their motion. Upon which account, the true and 
absolute motion of a body cannot be determined by the translation of it from 
those which only seem to rest; for the external bodies ought not only to appear 
at rest, but to be really at rest. For otherwise, all included bodies, besides 
their translation from near the surrounding ones, partake likewise of their true 
motions; and though that translation were not made, they would not be really at 
rest, but only seem to be so. For the surrounding bodies stand in the like 
relation to the surrounded as the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, 
or as the shell does to the kernel; but if the shell moves, the kernel will also 
move, as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the shell. </P>
<P>A property, near akin to the preceding, is this, that if a place is moved, 
whatever is placed therein moves along with it; and therefore a body, which is 
moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the motion of its place. Upon 
which account, all motions, from places in motion, are no other than parts of 
entire and absolute motions; and every entire motion is composed of the motion 
of the body out of its first place, and the motion of this place out of its 
place; and so on, until we come to some immovable place, as in the 
before-mentioned example of the sailor. Wherefore, entire and absolute motions 
can be no otherwise determined than by immovable places; and for that reason I 
did before refer those absolute motions to immovable places, but relative ones 
to movable places. Now no other places are immovable but those that, from 
infinity to infinity, do all retain the same given position one to another; and 
upon this account must ever remain unmoved; and do thereby constitute immovable 
space. </P>
<P>The causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished, one from the 
other, are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate motion. True motion is 
neither generated nor altered, but by some force impressed upon the body moved; 
but relative motion may be generated or altered without any force impressed upon 
the body. For it is sufficient only to impress some force on other bodies with 
which the former is compared, that by their giving way, that relation may be 
changed, in which the relative rest or motion of this other body did consist. 
Again, true motion suffers always some change from any force impressed upon the 
moving body; but relative motion does not necessarily undergo any change by such 
forces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other bodies, 
with which the comparison is made, that the relative position may be preserved, 
then that condition will be preserved in which the relative motion consists. And 
therefore any relative motion may be changed when the true motion remains 
unaltered, and the relative may be preserved when the true suffers some change. 
Thus, true motion by no means consists in such relations. </P>
<P>The effects which distinguish absolute from relative motion are, the forces 
of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are no such forces in a 
circular motion purely relative, but in a true and absolute circular motion, 
they are greater or less, according to the quantity of the motion. If a vessel, 
hung by a long cord, is so often turned about that the cord is strongly twisted, 
then filled with water, and held at rest together with the water; thereupon, by 
the sudden action of another force, it is whirled about the contrary way, and 
while the cord is untwisting itself, the vessel continues for some time in this 
motion; the surface of the water will at first be plain, as before the vessel 
began to move; but after that, the vessel, by gradually communicating its motion 
to the water, will make it begin sensibly to revolve, and recede by little and 
little from the middle, and ascend to the sides of the vessel, forming itself 
into a concave figure (as I have experienced), and the swifter the motion 
becomes, the higher will the water rise, till at last, performing its 
revolutions in the same times with the vessel, it becomes relatively at rest in 
it. This ascent of the water shows its endeavour to recede from the axis of its 
motion; and the true and absolute circular motion of the water, which is here 
directly contrary to the relative, becomes known, and may be measured by this 
endeavour. At first, when the relative motion of the water in the vessel was 
greatest, it produced no endeavour to recede from the axis; the water showed no 
tendency to the circumference, nor any ascent towards the sides of the vessel, 
but remained of a plain surface, and therefore its true circular motion had not 
yet begun. But afterwards, when the relative motion of the water had decreased, 
the ascent thereof towards the sides of the vessel proved its endeavour to 
recede from the axis; and this endeavour showed the real circular motion of the 
water continually increasing, till it had acquired its greatest quantity, when 
the water rested relatively in the vessel. And therefore this endeavour does not 
depend upon any translation of the water in respect of the ambient bodies, nor 
can true circular motion be defined by such translation. There is only one real 
circular motion of any one revolving body, corresponding to only one power of 
endeavouring to recede from its axis of motion, as its proper and adequate 
effect; but relative motions, in one and the same body, are innumerable, 
according to the various relations it bears to external bodies, and, like other 
relations, are altogether destitute of any real effect, any otherwise than they 
may perhaps partake of that one only true motion. And therefore in their system 
who suppose that our heavens, revolving below the sphere of the fixed stars, 
carry the planets along with them; the several parts of those heavens, and the 
planets, which are indeed relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet really 
move. For they change their position one to another (which never happens to 
bodies truly at rest), and being carried together with their heavens, partake of 
their motions, and as parts of revolving wholes, endeavour to recede from the 
axis of their motions. </P>
<P>Wherefore relative quantities are not the quantities themselves, whose names 
they bear, but those sensible measures of them (either accurate or inaccurate), 
which are commonly used instead of the measured quantities themselves. And if 
the meaning of words is to be determined by their use, then by the names time, 
space, place, and motion, their [sensible] measures are properly to be 
understood; and the expression will be unusual, and purely mathematical, if the 
measured quantities themselves are meant. On this account, those violate the 
accuracy of language, which ought to be kept precise, who interpret these words 
for the measured quantities. Nor do those less defile the purity of mathematical 
and philosophical truths, who confound real quantities with their relations and 
sensible measures. </P>
<P>It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to 
distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent; because 
the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are performed, do by 
no means come under the observation of our senses. Yet the thing is not 
altogether desperate; for we have some arguments to guide us, partly from the 
apparent motions, which are the differences of the true motions; partly from the 
forces, which are the causes and effects of the true motions. For instance, if 
two globes, kept at a given distance one from the other by means of a cord that 
connects them, were revolved about their common centre of gravity, we might, 
from the tension of the cord, discover the endeavour of the globes to recede 
from the axis of their motion, and from thence we might compute the quantity of 
their circular motions. And then if any equal forces should be impressed at once 
on the alternate faces of the globes to augment or diminish their circular 
motions, from the increase or decrease of the tension of the cord, we might 
infer the increment or decrement of their motions; and thence would be found on 
what faces those forces ought to be impressed, that the motions of the globes 
might be most augmented; that is, we might discover their hindmost faces, or 
those which, in the circular motion, do follow. But the faces which follow being 
known, and consequently the opposite ones that precede, we should likewise know 
the determination of their motions. And thus we might find both the quantity and 
the determination of this circular motion, even in an immense vacuum, where 
there was nothing external or sensible with which the globes could be compared. 
But now, if in that space some remote bodies were placed that kept always a 
given position one to another, as the fixed stars do in our regions, we could 
not indeed determine from the relative translation of the globes among those 
bodies, whether the motion -did belong to the globes or to the bodies. But if we 
observed the cord, and found that its tension was that very tension which the 
motions of the globes required, we might conclude the motion to be in the 
globes, and the bodies to be at rest; and then, lastly, from the translation of 
the globes among the bodies, we should find the determination of their motions. 
But how we are to obtain the true motions from their causes, effects, and 
apparent differences, and the converse, shall be explained more at large in the 
following treatise. For to this end it was that I composed it.</P>

motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the 
air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance 
in freer spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much 
longer time. </P>
<H4>LAW II</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The change of motion is proportional to the motive 
force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that 
force is impressed.</SPAN></P>
<P>If any force generates n motion, a double force will generate double the 
motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed 
altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this- motion (being 
always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved 
before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they 
directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely 
joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the 
determination of both. </P>
<H4>LAW III</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>To every action there is always opposed an equal 
reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, 
and directed to contrary parts.</SPAN></P>
<P>Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. 
If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. 
If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may say so) will be 
equally drawn back towards the stone; fro the distended rope, by the saame 
endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as muchas it does the 
stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it 
advances that of the other. For, because the motions are equally changed, the 
changes of the velocities made towards contrary parts are inversely proportional 
to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in 
the next Scholium. ... </P>

<H2>SYSTEM OF THE WORLD<BR>(IN MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT)</H2>
<P class=fst>IN THE PRECEDING BOOKS I have laid down the principles of 
philosophy; principles not philosophical but mathematical: such, namely, as we 
may 1 build our reasonings upon in philosophical inquiries. These principles are 
the laws and conditions of certain motions, and powers or forces, which chiefly 
have respect to philosophy; but, lest they should have appeared of themselves 
dry and barren, I have illustrated them here and there with some philosophical 
scholiums, giving an account of such things as are of more general nature, and 
which philosophy seems chiefly to be founded on; such as the density and the 
resistance of bodies, spaces void of all bodies, and the motion of light and 
sounds. It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame 
of the System of the World. Upon this subject I had, indeed, composed the third 
Book in a popular method, that it might be read by many; but afterwards, 
considering that such as had not sufficiently entered into the principles could 
not easily discern the strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the 
prejudices to which they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent 
the disputes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce the 
substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the mathematical way), 
which should be read by those only who had first made themselves masters of the 
principles established in 0 the preceding Books: not that I would advise anyone 
to the previous study of every Proposition of those Books; for they abound with 
such as might cost too much time, even to readers of good mathematical learning. 
It is . enough if one carefully reads the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and 
the first three sections of the first Book. He may then pass on to this Book, 
and consult such of the remaining Propositions of the first two Books, as the 
references in this, and his occasions, shall require.</P>
<HR class=section>
<A name=rules></A>
<H3>RULES OF REASONING<BR>IN PHILOSOPHY</H3>
<H4>RULE I</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>We are to admit no more causes of natural things 
than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their 
appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P>To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and 
more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity, and 
affects not the pomp of superfluous causes. </P>
<H4>RULE II</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as 
far as possible, assign the same causes.</SPAN> </P>
<P>As to respiration in a man and in a beast; the descent of stones in Europe 
and in America; the light of our culinary fire and of the sun; the reflection of 
light in the earth, and in the planets. </P>
<H4>RULE III</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>The qualities of bodies, which admit neither 
intensification nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all 
bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal 
qualities of all bodies whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P>For since the qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments, we are 
to hold for universal all such as universally agree with experiments; and such 
as are not liable to diminution can never be quite taken away. We are certainly 
not to relinquish the evidence of experiments for the sake of dreams and vain 
fictions of our own devising; nor are we to recede from the analogy of Nature, 
which is wont to be simple, and always consonant to itself. We no other way know 
the extension of bodies than by our senses, nor do these reach it in all bodies; 
but because we perceive extension in all tht are sensible, therefore we ascribe 
it universally to all others also. That abundance of bodies are hard, we learn 
by experience; and because the hardness of the whole arises from the hardness of 
the parts, we therefore justly infer the hardness of the undivided particles not 
only of the bodies we feel but of all others. That all bodies are impenetrable, 
we gather not from reason, but from sensation. The bodies which we handle we 
find impenetrable, and thence conclude impenetrability to be an universal 
property of all bodies whatsoever. That all bodies are movable, and endowed with 
certain powers (which we call the inertia) of persevering in their motion, or in 
their rest, we only infer from the like properties observed in the bodies which 
we have seen. The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and inertia of 
the whole, result from the extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and 
inertia of the parts; and hence we conclude the least particles of all bodies to 
be also all extended, and hard and impenetrable, and movable, and endowed with 
their proper inertia. And this is the foundation of all philosophy. Moreover, 
that the divided but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated from one 
another, is matter of observation; and, in the particles that remain undivided, 
our minds are able to distinguish yet lesser parts, as is mathematically 
demonstrated. But whether the parts so distinguished, and not yet divided, may, 
by the powers of Nature, be actually divided and separated from one another, we 
cannot certainly determine. Yet, had we the proof of but one experiment that any 
undivided particle, in breaking a hard and solid body, suffered a division, we 
might by virtue of this rule conclude that the undivided as well as the divided 
particles may be divided and actually separated to infinity. </P>
<P>Lastly, if it universally appears, by experiments and astronomical 
observations, that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the earth, and 
that in proportion to the quantity of matter which they severally contain; that 
the moon likewise, according to the quantity of its matter, gravitates towards 
the earth; that, on the other hand, our sea gravitates towards the moon; and, 
all the planets one towards another; and the comets in like manner towards- the 
sun; we must, in consequence of this rule, universally allow that all bodies 
whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation. </P>
<P>For the argument from the appearances concludes with more force for the 
universal gravitation of all bodies than for their impenetrability; of which, 
among those in the celestial regions, we have no experiments, nor any manner of 
observation. Not that I affirm gravity to be essential to bodies: by their vis 
insita I mean nothing but their inertia. This is immutable. Their gravity is 
diminished as they recede from the earth. </P>
<H4>RULE IV</H4>
<P class=fst><SPAN class=date>In experimental philosophy we are to look, upon 
propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very 
nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till 
such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may cither be made more 
accurate, or liable to exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P>This rule we must follow, that the argument of induction may not be evaded by 
hypotheses.</P>

<H3>GENERAL SCHOLIUM</H3>
<P>The hypothesis of vortices is pressed with many difficulties. That every 
planet by a radius drawn to the sun may describe areas proportional to the times 
of description, the periodic times of the several parts of the vortices should 
observe the square of their distances from the sun; but that the periodic times 
of the planets may obtain the 3/2th power of their distances from the sun, the 
periodic times of the parts of the vortex ought to be as the 3/2th power of 
their distances. That the smaller vortices may maintain their lesser revolutions 
about Saturn, Jupiter, and other planets, and swim quietly and undisturbed in 
the greater vortex of the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the sun's 
vortex should be equal; but the rotation of the sun and planets about their 
axes, which ought to correspond with the motions of their vortices, recede far 
from all these proportions. The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, 
are governed by the same laws with the motions of the planets, and can by no 
means be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices; for comets are carried 
with very eccentric motions through all parts of the heavens indifferently, with 
a freedom that is incompatible with the notion of a vortex. </P>
<P>Bodies projected in our air suffer no resistance but from the air. Withdraw 
the air, as is done in <I>Mr. Boyle's</I> vacuum, and the resistance ceases; for 
in this void a bit of fine down and a piece of solid gold descend with equal 
velocity. And the same argument must apply to the celestial spaces above the 
earth's atmosphere; in these spaces, where there is no air to resist their 
motions, all bodies will move with the greatest freedom; and the planets and 
comets will constantly pursue their revolutions in orbits given in kind and 
position, according to the laws above explained; but though these bodies may, 
indeed, continue in their orbits by the mere laws of gravity, yet they could by 
no means have at first derived the regular position of the orbits themselves 
from those laws. </P>
<P>The six primary planets are revolved about the sun in circles concentric with 
the sun, and with motions directed towards the same parts, and almost in the 
same plane. Ten moons are revolved about the earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, in 
circles concentric with them, with the same direction of motion, and nearly in 
the planes of the orbits of those planets; but it is not to be conceived that 
mere mechanical causes could give birth to so many regular motions, since the 
comets range over all parts of the heavens in very eccentric orbits; for by that 
kind of motion they pass easily through the orbs of the planets, and with great 
rapidity; and in their aphelions, where they move the slowest, and are detained 
the longest, they recede to the greatest distances from each other, and hence 
suffer the least disturbance from their mutual attractions. This most beautiful 
system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and 
dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the 
centres of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsel, 
must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since the light of the 
fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, and from every 
system light passes into all the other systems: and lest the systems of the 
fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other, he hath placed those 
systems at immense distances from one another. </P>
<P>This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over 
all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called <I>Lord God 
pantokrator</I>, or <I>Universal Ruler</I>; for <I>God</I> is a relative word, 
and has a respect to servants; and Deity is the dominion of God not over his own 
body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over 
servants. The Supreme God is a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely perfect; but 
a being, however perfect, without dominion, cannot be said to be Lord God; for 
we say, my God, your God, the God of <I>Israel</I>, the God of Gods, and Lord of 
Lords; but we do not say, my Eternal, your Eternal, the Eternal of 
<I>Israel</I>, the Eternal of Gods; we do not say, my Infinite, or my Perfect: 
these are titles which have no respect to servants. The word God' usually 
signifies Lord; but every lord is not a God. It is the dominion of a spiritual 
being which constitutes a God: a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion makes a 
true, supreme, or imaginary God. And from his true dominion it follows that the 
true God is a living, intelligent, and powerful Being; and, from his other 
perfections, that he is supreme, or most perfect. He is eternal and infinite, 
omnipotent and omniscient; that is, his duration reaches from eternity to 
eternity; his presence from infinity to infinity; he governs all things, and 
knows all things that are or can be done. He is not eternity and infinity, but 
eternal and infinite; he is not duration or space, but he endures and is 
present. He endures forever, and is everywhere present- and, by existing always 
and everywhere, he constitutes duration and space. Since every particle of space 
is <I>always</I>, and every indivisible moment of duration is <I>everywhere</I>, 
certainly the Maker and Lord of all things cannot be <I>never</I> and 
<I>nowhere</I>. Every soul that has perception is, though in different times and 
in different organs of sense and motion, still the same indivisible person. 
There are given successive parts in duration, coexistent parts in space, but 
neither the one nor the other in the person of a man, or his thinking principle; 
and much less can they be found in the thinking substance of God. Every man, so 
far as he is a thing that has perception, is one and the same man during his 
whole life, in all and each of his organs of sense. God is the same God, always 
and everywhere. He is omnipresent not <I>virtually</I> only, but also 
<I>substantially</I>; for virtue cannot subsist without substance. In him are 
all things contained and moved; yet neither affects the other: God suffers 
nothing from the motion of bodies; bodies find no resistance from the 
omnipresence of God. It is allowed by all that the Supreme God exists 
necessarily; and by the same necessity he exists always and <I>everywhere</I>. 
Whence also he is all similar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm, all power 
to perceive, to understand, and to act; but in a manner not at all human, in a 
manner not at all corporeal, in a manner utterly unknown to us. As a blind man 
has no idea of colours, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all-wise 
God perceives and understands all things. He is utterly void of all body and 
bodily figure, and can therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched; nor 
ought he to be worshiped under the representation of any corporeal thing. We 
have ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of anything is we know 
not. In bodies, we see only their figures and colours, we hear only the sounds, 
we touch only their outward surfaces, we smell only the smells, and taste the 
savours; but their inward substances are not to be known either by our senses, 
or by any reflex act of our minds: much less, then, have we any idea of the 
substance of God. We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances 
of things, and final causes; we admire him for his perfections; but we reverence 
and adore him on account of his dominion: for we adore him as his servants; and 
a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate 
and Nature. Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same always and 
everywhere, could produce no variety of things. All that diversity of natural 
things which we find suited to different times and places could arise from 
nothing but the ideas and will of a Being necessarily existing. But, by way of 
allegory, God is said to see, to speak, to laugh, to love, to hate, to desire, 
to give, to receive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight, to frame, to work, to 
build; for all our notions of God are taken from the ways of mankind by a 
certain similitude, which, though not perfect, has some likeness, however. And 
thus much concerning God; to discourse of whom from the appearances of things, 
does certainly belong to Natural Philosophy. </P>
<P>Hitherto we have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the 
power of gravity, but have not yet assigned the cause of this power. This is 
certain, that it must proceed from a cause that penetrates to the very centres 
of the sun and planets, without suffering the least diminution of its force; 
that operates not according to the quantity of the surfaces of the particles 
upon which it acts (as mechanical causes used to do), but according to the 
quantity of the solid matter which they contain, and propagates its virtue on 
all sides to immense distances, decreasing always as the inverse square of the 
distances. Gravitation towards the sun is made up out of the gravitations 
towards the several particles of which the body of the sun is composed; and in 
receding from the sun decreases accurately as the inverse square of the 
distances as far as the orbit of Saturn, as evidently appears from the 
quiescence of the aphelion of the planets; nay, and even to the remotest 
aphelion of the comets, if those aphelions are also quiescent. </P>
<P>But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties 
of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not 
deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, 
whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, 
have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular 
propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by 
induction. Thus it was that the impenetrability, the mobility, and the impulsive 
force of bodies, and the laws of motion and of gravitation, were discovered. And 
to us it is enough that gravity does really exist, and act according to the laws 
which we have explained, and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of 
the celestial bodies, and of our sea. </P>
<P>And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle spirit which 
pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies; by the force and action of which 
spirit the particles of bodies attract one another at near distances, and 
cohere, if contiguous; and electric bodies operate to greater distances, as well 
repelling as attracting the neighbouring corpuscles; and light is emitted, 
reflected, refracted, inflected, and heats bodies; and all sensation is excited, 
and the members of animal bodies move at the command of the will, namely, by the 
vibrations of this spirit, mutually propagated along the solid filaments of the 
nerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain, and from the brain into 
the muscles. But these are things that cannot be explained in few words, nor are 
we furnished with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an 
accurate determination and demonstration of the laws by which this electric and 
elastic spirit operates. </P>
