       <big><big>The Meaning of Life</big></big><big><big><br>
       </big></big><a href="/smith/index.htm">Barry Smith</a>
      <br>
     Spring Semester 2003<br>
     Wednesday 4pm<br>
       <br>
     What makes your life meaningful is -- in first approximation -- the
plans   which it contains. Not just any old plans will do. They must be your
plans,   they must be directed towards what you will do in the future, and
they must   impose some pattern on your life of a sort which will make it,
precisely,   meaningful. <br>
     The seminar will discuss the arguments for and against this view of
meaning,   drawing on a book manuscript which is nearing completion. It will
feature   a special Saturday workshop on March 1 devoted to the topic of
"Religion  and the Meaning of Life" and featuring Daniel von Wachter of the
University  of Munich, Germany.<br>
       <br>
     Examples of topics to be dealt with include:<br>
       <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why happiness, love, money, knowledge, friendship,
 talent  and religion do not make a life worth living.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why performing the right sorts of actions in accordance 
  with the right sorts of plans is what makes a life worth living.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What sorts of plans are the right sorts of plans? 
  <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The role of achievements, sacrifice, risk, honesty
 and  failure in a meaningful life.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why the meaning of life is not something merely subjective.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sort of society is most conducive to leading
a  meaningful  life? (includes discussions of politics and economics) <br>
       <br>
     A draft version of the book manuscript will be made available on the 
web,   together with a list of supplementary readings. Students will be required 
  to prepare two essays and to make two class presentations. Length, format, 
  topics and deadlines will be specified at a later stage.<br>
