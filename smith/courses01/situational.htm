  <p>The point of this extract, as of the already distributed paper by Perry,
is to show that, in our knowledge of the world around us, we cannot do without
essential (irremovable) uses of terms like &lsquo;this&rsquo; or &lsquo;that&rsquo;. Some knowledge
(e.g. that 2+2=4) is situation free. Knowledge whose expression involves
irremovable uses of &lsquo;this&rsquo; or &lsquo;that&rsquo; or &lsquo;here&rsquo; or &lsquo;now&rsquo; is <span style="font-weight: bold; ">
situational.</span></p>

  <p>From: Z. Pylyshyn, &ldquo;Situating vision in the world,&rdquo; <i>Trends in Cognitive
Sciences</i>, 2000, p. 199):  </p>
 <br>
 
  <p>In arguing that demonstratives (and other indexicals, like the italicized
words in &lsquo;<i><span style="font-weight: bold; ">I</span></i> am <i><span style="font-weight: bold; ">
here now</span></i>&rsquo;) are essential and cannot be replaced by descriptions,
philosopher John Perry gives the following example:  </p>
 
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; ">Â </p>
 
  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; ">The author of the book <i>Hiker&rsquo;s Guide
to the Desolation Wilderness</i> stands in the wilderness beside Gilmore
Lake looking at the Mt. Tallac trail as it leaves the lake and climbs the
mountain. He desires to leave the wilderness. He believes that the best way
out from Gilmore Lake is to follow the Mt. Tallac trail up the mountain ...
but he doesn&rsquo;t move. He is lost. He is not sure whether he is standing beside
Gilmore lake, looking at Mt. Tallac, or beside Clyde Lake, looking at the
Maggie peaks. Then he begins to move along the Mt. Tallac trail. If asked,
he would have to explain the crucial change in his beliefs in this way: &lsquo;I
came to believe that this is the Mt. Tallac and that is the Gilmore lake&rsquo;
 [Perry, J., 1979, The problem of the essential indexical, <i>Nous</i>, 13,
3-21, p. 4)] </p>
 <br>
 
  <p>The point of this example is that to understand and explain the action
of the lost author, it is essential to use demonstratives, such as the terms
&lsquo;this&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo;, in both the description and, more importantly, in stating
the authors&rsquo; beliefs. <span style="font-weight: bold; ">A more elaborate
description of what the mountain trail looked like might have helped to bring
the author to the right beliefs, but the problem would have remained unsolved
until he had the thought that the trail in front of him (&lsquo;that&rsquo; trail) is,
in fact, the Mt. Tallac trail.</span> Without some way to directly select
the referent of a descriptive term and link the perceived object to its cognitive
representation, people would be unable to act upon their knowledge and theorists
would not be able to explain their actions.</p>
