style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>After the events of September 11, much has been written about the 
political actions which preceded the horrible tragedy.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The aim of many of the commentators, 
especially in the print and television media, is to pinpoint the major political 
actions or events that precipitated what happened on September 11.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The focus of much of the political 
discussion seems to be divided between two major themes.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>These are the American support of Israel 
and the Soviet-Afghan War and America’s neglect of the Mujahidin upon the war’s 
conclusion.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The point of this essay 
is not to downplay these significant policy concerns.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Rather, here I wish to bring to light an 
important conflict which has gone largely unnoticed: The Iran-Iraq War 
(1980-1988).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It has escaped 
attention mostly because it took place at the same time as the Soviet war 
against Afghanistan.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, it is 
my view that the Iran-Iraq War played a key role in setting the stage for 
September 11.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We would do well to 
briefly examine the combatants of this war.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>First of all Iraq was ruled, and is still ruled to this day, by the Ba’th 
(Renaissance) Party.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is 
important to realize what the Ba’thists stood for leading up to the war against 
the Iranians.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Party was 
committed to modernizing Iraq.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Indeed the Party was successful in bringing such things as electricity 
and compulsory education to the backward southern region of the country.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Ba’thists emphasized secularity as 
key to modernization.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This fact 
lead to a revolt among some Shia opposition groups in the south.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The response of the Ba’thists, led by 
Saddam Hussein, was to crush the rebellion by use of force.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, Hussein offered a carrot to the 
Shia community by opening up the Sunni Ba’th Party to Shias.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This had the effect of transforming the 
Party from one of exclusivity to one that enjoyed plenty of popular support from 
the Shia majority. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>In comparison, a review of the popular trend in Iran at the time just 
preceding the war reveals a society moving in the opposite direction.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The movement toward fundamentalism in 
Iran at this time is so widely known that it barely needs comment.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The overthrow of the Shah in 1979 and 
the establishment of the Islamic republic of Iran marked the beginning of this 
trend.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The only thing that Iran and 
Iraq seemed to share was a border.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>A clear and distinct ideological line marked the conflict between Iran 
and Iraq.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The combatants embodied 
different ideas of progress: Iraq pursued modernization while Iran sought to 
undo the modernization initiated by the Shah in order to pursue a civilization 
governed by Islamic Law.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It must be 
underscored that this clash of civilizations occurred within the Muslim 
community.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>What this suggests is 
that the battle line between Islamic fundamentalism and the West is a malleable 
one.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is one that is as dynamic 
as a battle line on a real battlefield.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>It is not as static as those who see the line drawn at the West Bank or 
Gaza would like to believe.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>However, it would be foolish to simply equate modernization with 
westernization.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Becoming a member 
of the West, which we all should believe is possible, means much more than 
simply modernizing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The case of 
Iraq proves this.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Iraq’s ostracism 
at the hands of the international community upon invading Kuwait shows that 
complete westernization comes only by obeying the rules of international 
relations.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Another condition for 
westernization is that the regime recognize and uphold the basic freedoms (for 
example, freedom of speech) of its citizens. This is a condition in which Iraq 
has failed for some time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
history of Iraq shows that there is a trade off between modernization and the 
state recognition of human rights and freedoms that exists within developing 
countries.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Iraq chose to pursue the 
former at the sacrifice of the latter.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The U.S. has consistently used its military to support modernizing 
regimes and has tried to promote human rights through diplomatic means.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This policy has caused concern among 
human rights groups.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, when 
we place the unsavory modernizing regimes back into the world and consider their 
fundamentalist neighbors we realize that there is at least some wisdom in U.S. 
foreign policy.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>And by the way Iraq won the war.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The Iraqi Army adopted modern tactics and the War in Iraq enjoyed 
widespread support due to Saddam’s political maneuverings.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<H1 style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">The Link to 9/11</H1>
<P class=MsoNormal><B><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN></B>How does all of this link up to September 11?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There are two links.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>First is the indirect connection.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The indirect connection essentially 
states that the Iraqis won the war, but lost the peace.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In order to beat Iran, the population of 
which out numbered Iraq almost 3 to 1, Iraq overextended itself 
financially.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Thus Iraq invaded 
Kuwait in part to attempt to alleviate some of its financial problems.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This resulted in the Gulf War and the 
opportunity for the U.S. military to establish bases in Saudi Arabia, which so 
angered Islamists like Bin Laden.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>However, there is another layer to this onion. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>One of the most significant aspects of the Islamic republic of Iran is 
its support of terrorism.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Indeed it 
is written in the Constitution that one of the duties of the regime is to export 
the revolution.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The Constitution 
however leaves unspecified just how the regime is to carry out this duty.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Consequently how it is carried out is 
left to the interpretation of whoever is in charge.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Who is in charge is not always so clear 
in Iran since the beginning of the revolution.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The regime has been plagued by a power 
struggle between the conservative clerics and the moderates that continues 
today.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Yet the export of the 
revolution has occurred historically in two ways.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>First the revolution has served as an 
exemplar to aspiring Islamic terror groups such as Abu Sayeef in the 
Philippines.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Second Iran has 
directly supported terrorist groups, for example Hizbollah in southern 
Lebanon.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I theorize that the defeat of Iran dented the cause of state-sponsored 
terrorism.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The loss left a vacuum 
that showed the inadequacies of state-sponsored terrorism especially if the 
state that is sponsoring terrorism is as backward as Iran.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The cause of terrorism needed a 
benefactor or many benefactors who not only had large checkbooks, but who also 
viewed supporting terror much like Bill Gates views the support of technology in 
the classroom.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The support of 
terrorism is a philanthropic concern for those who are bankrolling it.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Terror is not just an attack on 
modernization or America.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
principals see it as spreading justice throughout the world.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It must be seen in this way in order to 
blind the participants to the inherent evil of the actions which they 
commit.</P>
