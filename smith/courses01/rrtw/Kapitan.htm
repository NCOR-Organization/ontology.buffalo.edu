<P><B>Nationalism and Prejudice</B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>As social animals, we are heirs to a variety of cultural influences that 
shape our identities, aspirations, values, and tastes. It is not unusual to feel 
trust and affinity with persons of like background, to desire primary and even 
exclusive association with them. The result is that rich satisfaction that comes 
from participation in culturally specific activities, from artistic expression 
to sports, romance to worship. Yet the very attitudes and conventions that bind 
individuals also partition humanity into distinct cultural groups, even within a 
single locale. When the resulting contrast of "we" with "they" is added to our 
unenviable propensity to shift blame for our misfortunes and anxieties to 
others, inter-communal suspicion often results. In times of intense political 
competition and social upheaval this tendency can generate open hatred and 
persecution. 
<P>What is the proper response to culturally-driven prejudice? Through what 
mechanisms and ideals can a society mitigate its negative impact? How should 
cultural minorities themselves respond? Most educated people are aware of the 
benefits of variety, and cognizant that it thrives only with a significant 
degree of institutionalized tolerance. But when dominant majorities are 
prejudicial, the question of how minorities should react becomes especially 
poignant. Answers to it waver between calls for <I>assimilation</I> and demands 
for <I>cultural autonomy</I>. The former may involve anything from 
self-eradication of distinguishing traits to mere verbal acquiescence to 
prevailing norms. The latter may take the form of non-confrontational 
concealment, open advocacy of an autonomous cultural group within majority 
culture, emigration to more favorable locales and, finally, formation of a 
politically separate national unit through secession or relocation. 
<P>The history of the Jews in 19th and 20th Century Europe illustrates the 
problem. Enlightenment and economic development had brought about a gradual 
emancipation of Jewish populations from previous ghettoization. But liberation 
was concurrent with rising nationalism in countries that had commonly excluded 
their participation in the political arena. Because of their differences and 
their connections--real or imaginary--to Jewish communities in other countries, 
Jews were thought opposed to national interests.<SUP>1</SUP> Antisemitism 
erupted in the Russian pogroms of 1881-84 and in the early 20th Century, 
resulting in massive emigration of Jews from Russia. Similar sentiments were 
widespread in other parts of Europe as well, and were vividly voiced in France 
during the 1894 Dreyfus Affair. In each case, government complicity heightened 
Jewish alarm. 
<P>Emancipation itself posed a threat. Promising integration into mainstream 
European culture, many Jews came to believe that assimilation was their future 
and that adherence to old ways would expose them to further discrimination. But 
others feared assimilation would dilute what was distinctive about Judaism and 
Jews. The Jewish community thereby faced a difficult choice: by assimilating, 
their distinctive culture may very well be lost, whereas opting for cultural 
autonomy would carry the risk of continued antisemitism. In both cases, survival 
of a separate Jewish people is threatened. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Zionism</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Zionism emerged in the late nineteenth century as an effort to resolve this 
dilemma. In its political form it called for establishment of a Jewish State, 
and, in both its nationalistic aspiration and identification of Palestine as the 
Jewish homeland its roots are ancient. Some of its leading spokesmen were 
convinced antisemitism could not be eradicated and that preservation of a 
distinct Jewish people required an independent Jewish homeland. Leo Pinsker 
argued that while emancipation may solve the problems of individual Jews, it 
will not solve the problem of the Jewish <I>nation</I>. If the Jewish people do 
not acquire the effective external attributes of a nation, they will remain 
"everywhere as guests" and "nowhere <I>at home</I>."<SUP>2</SUP> Assimilation 
would be "national death," whereas a Jewish state would not only provide the 
benefits of emancipation under the guise of "normalization," but a place of 
refuge where Jews could manage affairs in their own way without the perpetual 
stigma of minority status. With this reasoning, Zionism was as much an instance 
of nineteenth century nationalism as it was a response to emancipation and 
antisemitism (Avineri 1981, 13; Reinharz and Shapira 1995, 7). 
<P>By the time Theodore Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress in 1897, 
several thousand European Jews had already immigrated to Palestine. The Congress 
called for creation of a Jewish home "secured by public law" and established the 
World Zionist Organization to work towards this end. Herzl's strategy included 
strengthening Jewish national sentiment, stimulating Jewish investment in 
Palestine, promoting immigration to assure a Jewish majority, and obtaining the 
assistance of foreign powers. Failure to gain support from the Turkish 
Government led some to suggest that prospects might be better in places like 
Uganda or Argentina, but it was eventually agreed that the link of Jews to 
Palestine provided a more effective rallying point for gaining 
adherents.<SUP>3</SUP> As the Ottoman grasp on much of the Near East weakened, 
it became apparent that European nations would soon determine the political 
fortunes of the region. 
<P>At the outset, many Jews opposed Zionism. Thinkers like Simon Dubnow 
acknowledged that Jews form a distinct nation, but he distinguished between 
nation and state, arguing that a nation can achieve social and cultural autonomy 
even if it lacks political independence. Opposed to both separation and 
assimilation, Dubnow argued that Jewish creativity was due to the fact that 
Jewish nationality is spiritual rather than territorial and thrives in 
autonomous Jewish communities (Selzer 1970, 131-156). Others disliked the 
nationalism and particularism of Zionism. In 1918, Hermann Cohen, a leader of 
the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism, spoke of a parallel between Kant's call 
for a federation of nations under law and the universalism of Judaism, arguing 
that the latter would be compromised if Judaism took on nationalistic overtones. 
Not only does Zionism insult the patriotism of Jews who feel at home in their 
countries of birth, but to think that the teachings of Judaism are reserved for 
the Jewish people alone effectively denies the "One God of Messianic mankind." 
Israel's chosenness must be regarded as history's means to accomplish the divine 
chosenness of mankind (Cohen 1971, 169-171). A year later, the American 
philosopher Morris Cohen echoed Dubnow by contending that Jews contributed the 
most to civilization when they were mixed with other peoples. The key to 
resolving the Jewish problem lay not in nationalism but in the liberal tradition 
of tolerance and pluralism. The Zionist call for a state "founded on a peculiar 
race, a tribal religion, and a mystic belief in a peculiar soil" is "profoundly 
inimical to liberal or humanistic civilization" (Cohen 1946, 329). Liberal 
democracy gives Jews, with all other individuals, equal protection of rights and 
freedoms under the law; it alone holds the cure to the woes produced by the evil 
of tribalism. 
<P>Both philosophers met with opposition. While agreeing with Hermann Cohen that 
Judaism had a universal message, Martin Buber argued that the mission of Jews 
requires a separate state wherein they can set an example of "good living," 
where a "biblical humanism" might prevail in a nation abiding by demands of 
justice and mercy. Horace Kallen challenged Morris Cohen's caricature of 
Zionism, maintaining that Zionism is an extension of the assumptions of 
liberalism from the individual to the group. Nationalities themselves have the 
rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and if liberal 
enlightenment means anything then it must support the rights of thought and 
association on the parts of cultural groups as well as on the part of 
individuals. Liberalism does not deny the legitimacy of nationhood and there is 
no reason why a Jewish state cannot be both secular and liberal (Hertzberg 1977, 
528, and see Kallen 1921).<SUP>4</SUP> 
<P>Zionism eventually prevailed within the Jewish community. In the United 
States alone, the Zionist movement headed by Justice William Brandeis grew from 
12,000 members in 1914 to 176,000 members by 1919. Its appeal increased 
dramatically as antisemitism took an ugly turn during the 1930s, and when the 
horrors of Nazi genocide were brought to light after WWII, Zionism triumphed in 
the minds of most Jews and a large segment of non-Jews. More than ever, Zionism 
seemed to offer "the only political answer the Jews have ever found to 
antisemitism" (Arendt 1968, 120). <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Zionism and the "Arab Problem"</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>The lure of Zionism blinded many to the fact that Palestine was already 
inhabited. By 1897, that 10,000 square mile area had been under Turkish rule for 
nearly four centuries and contained 600,000 people, 95% Arab (predominantly 
Muslim) and 5% Jews.<SUP>5</SUP> By 1918, after the first two waves of Jewish 
immigration, the percentage of Jews rose to approximately 10%. Ownership of 
about half the land was in private Arab hands, 2.6% was privately owned by Jews, 
and while the remainder was State property under the Ottoman law, much of it had 
been farmed by generations of Arab villagers. 
<P>The greatest moral challenge to Zionism was (and remains) that a seemingly 
noble, and to some, intensely spiritual, vision--the restoration of the Jewish 
people to their ancient homeland--could be fulfilled only at the expense of 
another people, the Arab inhabitants of Palestine. While a few Zionists accepted 
the fiction that Palestine was "a land without people" waiting for "a people 
without a land,"<SUP>6</SUP> most were aware of an indigenous population, but 
argued that Jewish need and rights to a homeland Jews had been unjustly deprived 
of 1900 years earlier outweighed the claims of the Arabs. Others ignored the 
problem, their priority being to create a Jewish socioeconomic infrastructure in 
Palestine by encouraging immigration, acquiring land, building Jewish 
institutions, and developing the capacities of Jewish labor. 
<P>The issue could not be neglected for long, and by 1905 there was debate among 
Zionists over strategies to pursue in the face of incipient Arab nationalism. 
Mainstream political Zionism, under the leadership of Chaim Weizmann, sought to 
convince Arabs that there was room for both peoples in Palestine, that Zionism 
had no intention of dispossessing people of their property, and that Arabs stood 
to benefit by cooperation with the Jews. Others, like the writer Ahad Ha'am, 
were less sanguine, believing that relations with the local Arabs constituted 
the principal moral difficulty faced by Zionism. He complained of Zionists who, 
<BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . wax angry towards those who remind them that there is still 
  another people in Eretz Israel that has been living there and does not intend 
  all to leave its place. In the future, when this illusion will have been torn 
  from their hearts and they will look with open eyes upon the reality as it is, 
  they will certainly understand how important this question is and how great is 
  our duty to work for its solution (Selzer 1970, 196-7).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>Already in the 1890s, Ahad Ha'am warned against arrogant behavior towards 
the Arabs--regarded by some as "wild beasts of the desert"--and of the sentiment 
expressed by the slogan that "the only language that the Arabs understand is 
force" (Sachar 1979, 163; Avineri 1981, 123-124). The priority of Zionism should 
be to create a "spiritual center" which would foster an atmosphere of peace with 
the Arabs. 
<P>Inspired by Ahad Ha'am, Zionist movements like the <I>Brit Shalom</I> in the 
1920s and its successor in the 1940s, the <I>Ihud</I> movement of Buber, Moshe 
Smilansky, and Judah Magnes, favored development of a common Jewish-Arab society 
under a <I>binational</I> state with sovereignty shared by the two peoples. For 
Buber, Zionism is justifiable if it leads to both a creative renewal of the 
Jewish spirit and an ethical Jewish community existing in "human solidarity" 
with the Arabs. <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have not settled Palestine together with the Arabs but 
  alongside them. Settlement "alongside" [<I>neben</I>], when two nations 
  inhabit the same country, which fails to become settlement "together with" 
  [<I>mit</I>] must necessarily become a state of "against." (Mendes-Flohr 1983, 
  91)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>Without agreement with the Arabs, Buber continued, the aims of Zionism 
will never be realized. Like Magnes, he urged that <I>parity</I> of distinct 
nationalities under a single political framework was a "noble goal" and a 
"challenge to the intelligence and moral qualities of peoples constituting 
multi-national lands" (Laqueur 1976, 107).<SUP>7</SUP> 
<P>Others were convinced that neither cooperation nor parity would solve the 
Arab problem. Vladimir Jabotinsky, founder of the Revisionist branch of Zionism, 
argued that it was folly to expect the Arabs to peacefully acquiesce to the 
Zionist program; as is natural, they would prefer to remain in the majority and 
that Palestine be another Arab state. They would resign themselves to minority 
status only when they become aware of Jewish military strength. Since the end of 
Zionism is moral, so are the necessary means to carry it out, even if this 
requires establishment of an "iron wall" of separation between the two 
communities. "Zionism is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls 
by the question of armed force. It is important to build, it is important to 
speak Hebrew, but, unfortunately, it is even more important to be able to shoot" 
(Brenner 1984, 78). 
<P>A more radical brand of Zionism advocated expulsion of the Arabs. Already in 
1895 Herzl wrote of the need to "try to spirit the penniless population across 
the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while 
denying it any employment in our own country" (Patai 1960, 88). Israel Zangwill, 
another prominent Zionist writer, proposed the "transfer" of Arabs to other Arab 
countries (Tessler 1994, 137), as did Joseph Weitz, a director of the Jewish 
National Land Fund in the 1930s: "it must be clear that there is no room for 
both peoples in this country" (Weitz 1965, 181-82). By 1940, Jabotinsky argued 
that a population exchange was a necessary evil, neither unprecedented nor a 
historical injustice (Gorny 1987, 270). While political leaders like David 
Ben-Gurion--Israel's first prime minister--occasionally spoke against removing 
the Arabs, during the 1948 war he declared that "I am for compulsory transfer: I 
don't see anything immoral in it" (Flapan 1987, 103). <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Arab Reaction and British Intervention</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>The Arab response to the Zionist project was initially one of incredulity, 
but, as Zionism gained ground, this attitude gave way to outrage and hostility. 
The reaction was what one could predict from a resident population whose lands 
were claimed by an external community. In 1899 the mayor of Jerusalem, Yusuf 
al-Khalidi, wrote to the Chief Rabbi of France telling him that while Zionism 
could be understood in theory, its implementation would require brute force 
since Palestine is an inhabited country under Ottoman rule. It would be better 
for everyone that "Palestine be left in peace" (Smith 1996, 35). Herzl himself 
replied to this letter, reassuring al-Khalidi that Arabs had nothing to fear 
from the immigration of the Jews who would make "faithful and good subjects" of 
the Turkish Sultan and "excellent brothers" for the Arabs (Hirst 1984, 17). 
<P>Brotherhood remained distant. Already in the 1880s and 1890s, Palestinian 
peasants protested after being evicted from land sold to immigrant Jews (Hirst 
1984, 21-32; Muslih 1988, 71; Khalidi 1988). The movement of European Jews into 
Palestine also coincided with a growing Arab national awareness. In 1905 a 
Palestinian author, Nagib Azouri, wrote that Arab nationalism and Jewish 
nationalism were destined to fight until one prevails, and voices were 
increasingly heard in the Palestinian press that Jews planned to expropriate 
property and drive Arabs from the country, generating calls to refuse to sell 
land to Jews. Palestinians like `Izzat Darwaza argued that Zionism posed a far 
greater danger than French or British imperialism because the Zionists take 
themselves to be "natives" of the land. "Palestine is purely Arab land . . 
surrounded on all sides by purely Arab lands. National (<I>al-qawmi</I>) feeling 
has begun to awaken and gain strength among the Arab population which has lived 
uninterruptedly in its own territory." Darwaza went on to say that the 
"introduction of a nationality of separate blood, tongue, aims, traditions, 
religion and policy would be dangerous indeed" (Porath 1974, 49). 
<P>Since the Ottomans fought with the Axis powers in WWI, Britain, with a 
foothold in Egypt, saw an opportunity to strike at Ottoman power from the south 
and strengthen its own presence in the Near East. It found a willing ally in 
Sheriff Hussein of Mecca who offered assistance in exchange for Arab 
independence throughout the region. A 1915-16 agreement, set forth through 
letters between Hussein and the British High Commissioner in Cairo, Sir Henry 
McMahon, was interpreted by Arabs as a treaty to which Britain was 
bound.<SUP>8</SUP> The joint Arab-British campaign was successful; by December 
1917 British troops entered Jerusalem and soon occupied the remainder of 
Palestine. 
<P>Zionists had already sensed an opportunity through collusion with a British 
Government whose Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, was sympathetic to Zionist 
aims. The British entry into Jerusalem came on the heels of a momentous 
statement of policy by Lloyd George's government, set forth in a letter to the 
Zionist financier, Baron Edmund de Rothschild, from the British Foreign 
Minister, Arthur Balfour. Its critical paragraph stated: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in 
  Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best 
  endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly 
  understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and 
  religious rights of existening non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the 
  rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>This carefully crafted document--the Balfour Declaration--was the product 
of extensive Zionist diplomacy. Overt reference to a Jewish state was avoided in 
favor of the euphemism "national home" for fear of inflaming Arab passions 
against the Jewish minority, though Lloyd George subsequently acknowledged that 
a Jewish state was intended. The Arabs, 90% of Palestine's population, were 
referred to as members of "non-Jewish communities", and while their "civil and 
religious rights" were recognized nothing was said about their political rights 
or their national aspirations. On the other hand, explicit reference was made to 
the "political status" of Jews in other countries. Boundaries had not been fixed 
(Veret&eacute; 1982, 77), though Zionists lobbied for a Jewish state on both sides of 
the Jordan. 
<P>As the terms of the Balfour Declaration became known, Palestinian opposition 
to Zionism crystallized into organized political expression. The first 
Palestinian Congress in 1919 issued a manifesto which dismissed Zionist claims 
to the land and was sharply critical of the Balfour Declaration. The contention 
of some Zionists that the Balfour Declaration was tantamount to creation of a 
state of Israel created alarm among the Arabs which was heightened by Weizmann's 
pronounced goal in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that "Palestine become 
Jewish as England is English." Palestinians like Darwaza thought that the best 
response was to favor a union within "greater Syria," but this option faded by 
1920 as Syria and Lebanon fell under French dominance in accord with the 
British-French agreements of 1916. The result was to isolate the Palestinian 
national movement from similar independence movements elsewhere in the Arab 
world. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>Rights to Territory</B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Disputes over land are among the most contentious in human affairs. Property 
is viewed as necessary to ensure survival and further a particular life-style, 
and a community's association with a particular territory is but an extension of 
this concern. The very passion with which it presses its claims suggests that 
difficult normative issues lurk nearby. It is one thing to ask who <I>owns</I> a 
particular parcel of land, another to inquire who has the right to <I>reside</I> 
within its boundaries, and yet another to determine who has political rights of 
<I>sovereignty</I> and <I>self-determination</I> in it. It must also be asked 
how these rights--if `rights' is the correct term--are acquired. 
<P>When attention turns to the territorial rights of communities, national 
groupings or states, sovereignty is the principal concern. Within international 
law, <I>de facto</I> power over a territory, say, of occupying forces or 
trustees, is insufficient to possess or acquire sovereignty (Brownlie 1990, 
111). The modern conception is that governmental authority is derived from the 
consent of the governed, and sovereignty over a particular territory is vested 
in the resident population. It is simple enough to identify the latter with the 
current inhabitants, but demographic flux makes this a loose criterion. Does an 
immigrant non-citizen share in sovereignty? Suppose he or she has arrived in the 
country illegally? What about long-term expatriates or those who have been 
expelled from their homelands? Presumably sovereignty rests with those who are 
entitled to live in the territory, with its <I>legitimate</I> residents, and the 
most obvious candidates are inhabitants who were born and raised to adulthood 
therein and whose discernible ancestors were equally indigenous. Those on the 
outside without historical, cultural, or legal ties, provide the clearest cases 
of non-residents. 
<P>Which individuals or groups have the right to inhabit Palestine? Who owns its 
fields, cities, and seaports? Who has the right to determine which legal and 
political structures are to prevail? Most importantly, who possesses 
sovereignty? Answers to these questions depend upon the time frame; the 
considerations offered in 1917 or 1947 could draw upon factors absent in 1897, 
and the same holds for the interval between 1947 and 1997. Differences in 
population distributions, in prevailing institutions, and in political 
developments are all relevant in approaching these questions. 
<P>In the aftermath of the first world war, both Arabs and Jews claimed 
political legitimacy in Palestine. Zionists argued that the <I>historical 
connection</I> of Jews to Palestine extends over three millennia--maintained by 
a "thin but crucial line of continuity" (Eban 1972, 26). The cultural roots of 
Jews in Palestine are universally acknowledged, and having never established a 
state elsewhere, there is no other place to which they can claim an original 
organic link (Shimoni 1995, 352-359). Palestine is also the center of the 
Judaism, and owes "the luster of its history" to the Jewish connection (Jewish 
Agency 1947, 105). Despite having been unjustly exiled from Palestine since 
Roman times, Jews have a unique claim to the land that they have never 
abandoned, one which implies that their political reestablishment would not be a 
matter of conquest and domination by an external entity, but of 
<I>restoration</I> (Eban 1956) or <I>return</I> (Fackenheim 1988) of a people to 
what was originally theirs. 
<P>By contrast, Arabs have other centers of culture and religion, and the region 
including Jerusalem was never as monumental to them as were their great cities 
of Mecca, Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo. Nor did Arabs ever establish an 
independent state in Palestine and, hence, Palestine's Arabs did not constitute 
a political unit with an entitlement to sovereignty (Gorny 1987, 145, 213-214). 
They are part of a larger Arab entity, not themselves a distinct <I>people</I> 
with claim to Palestine as such. Jews, on the other hand, currently constitute a 
single identifiable nation in need of a territory to further its culture. Their 
right to self-determination in Palestine is not simply a matter of their 
preference; the government that rules Palestine had recognized the Jewish claim 
to establish a national home there. For these reasons, Zionists concluded, 
historic title to Palestine and sovereignty over its territory, belongs to the 
Jews. 
<P>The Arabs argued that their right to dwell in Palestine, to possess and 
establish dominion over its territory, derived from the fact that they 
constitute not only the majority of its current inhabitants but have maintained 
this majority during the thirteen centuries since the Islamic conquest--if not 
longer given their descent from ancient Canaanites, Hittites and Philistines. 
The predominant language and culture of the country have remained Arabic 
throughout this period, including under Turkish rule. Even if Jews have a 
"historical connection" to Palestine, the inference that they have an exclusive 
"historic title" which gives them the right to return, establish a state, and 
possess it forever "contains more of poetry in it than logic." By that 
reasoning, "Arabs should claim Spain since once upon a time they conquered it 
and there developed a high civilization."<SUP>9</SUP> All systems of law include 
a statute of limitations by which a legal title expires after a considerable 
duration; without it, the world would face a cacophony of unresolvable claims 
and counter-claims. Jews native to Palestine are entitled to reside there and 
share in self-determination (Porath 1974, 61), but sovereignty belongs to the 
predominantly Arab indigenous population. 
<P>Arab spokesmen insisted that the Balfour Declaration was invalid. When the 
existing state power is removed, as happened in Palestine in 1917, sovereignty 
reverts back to the established population. In particular, the British military 
occupation neither transferred sovereignty to the occupying power nor removed it 
from the legitimate residents; Britain had no right to give Palestine as a 
"gift" to anyone and, therefore, its commitment has no binding force. But if any 
credence is to be given to promises of external powers then it must be 
remembered that Britain had pledged its support for Arab independence throughout 
the Middle East <I>prior</I> to issuing the Balfour Declaration, and reiterated 
it again in 1918 (Antonious 1965, 264). Since this pledge was made with an 
established monarch, it was superior to the Balfour Declaration which was given 
to "an amorphous body lacking political form and juridical definition" (Porath 
1974, 52). <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>The Principle of Self-Determination</B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>As the Balfour Declaration was penned, a conception was advanced that was to 
have a profound influence upon deliberations concerning sovereignty over 
territory. Termed a "principle of self-determination" by its chief advocate, 
U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, it specified that the settlement of all economic 
and political questions depends upon the "free acceptance of that settlement by 
the people immediately concerned." Both Arabs and Jews appealed to it at once. 
The clash of their claims requires a closer look at what the principle actually 
is. The basic issues are these: <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<UL>
  <LI>What is called for in a demand for self-determination, that is, what is it 
  that an entity possesses in being a self-determining unit? 
  <LI>What is the normative status of the concept of self-determination; is it a 
  legal right, a moral ideal, a regulative principle, etc.? 
  <LI>Who are the proper beneficiaries of self-determination? </LI></UL>
<P><BR>In general terms, self-determination is a community's <I>autonomy</I>, 
its right to manage its affairs as it sees fit independently of external 
interference. But in the <I>strict</I> sense usually intended, 
self-determination is a matter of sovereignty over territory. When existing 
self-governing countries are viewed as beneficiaries, the principle calls for 
<I>recognition</I> of state sovereignty and <I>non-intervention</I> in internal 
affairs. For a deserving community which is not yet self-governing, it provides 
that the community be allowed to determine the form of government that shall 
exercise authority over its territory and resources.<SUP>10</SUP> 
<P>Whether self-determination is best conceived as a legal right, a moral ideal, 
or a political maxim is a more difficult matter. After WWII, the principle was 
enshrined in agreements conditioning the development of international law, 
principally, Article 1 of the UN Charter which calls upon its members "to 
develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of 
equal rights and self-determination of peoples." That a <I>right</I> is 
recognized is indicated in the French version--"du principe de l'&eacute;galit&eacute; de 
droits des peuples et de leur droit &agrave; disposer d'eux-m&ecirc;mes,"--and by a number of 
General Assembly Resolutions. While these provisions do not settle the issue, 
the use of self-determination in justifying independence movements and 
prohibiting intervention has established its normative importance if not its 
<I>jus cogens</I> status in international law.<SUP>11</SUP> 
<P>The more difficult problems lie in determining beneficiaries among 
non-autonomous communities and fixing the territories in which they are entitled 
to (strict) self-determination. Obviously not just any group qualifies; families 
do not, nor do business organizations, professional associations, or social 
clubs. Minimally, a beneficiary must be capable of political independence and 
its members must share enough means of communication and moral ideals to 
constitute a <I>politically coherent</I> community (Ofuatey-Kodjoe 1977, 
156-159). Ideally, the group resides in a territory that is geographically 
unified and politically integrable, so that any point in the region is 
accessible from any other point without having to pass through foreign 
territory, other than international byways (Berg 1991, 214). But typically, 
linkage to a territory is more complicated, and attempts to apply the principle 
must reckon with current inhabitants as well as exiled communities, minorities 
dominating historically-recognized subregions, and majorities occupying larger 
areas containing or surrounding those subregions. 
<P>Beyond this, there is an important divergence. On one interpretation, 
<I>peoples</I> are the best claimants of a right to self-determination, where a 
"people" is any potentially autonomous group whose members share cultural or 
<I>national</I> ties. Alternatively, self-determining units are 
<I>populations</I> defined solely by reference to all and only legitimate 
residents of a given territory. These distinct ways of delineating beneficiaries 
underlie a difference between two concepts of strict self-determination. 
<I>Regional self-determination</I> occurs when the inhabitants of established 
regions, territories, or states settle for themselves all questions of 
sovereignty over that territory. While historical facts might be paramount in 
individuating a territory, beneficiaries include all and only its legitimate 
residents. By contrast, <I>national self-determination</I> exists when a nation 
or people preserve itself and manage its affairs as it sees fit, including when 
it constitutes itself as an independent sovereign state. At its crux is the idea 
that a beneficiary must be a community whose members self-consciously share a 
culture vital to the self-identity of each.<SUP>12</SUP> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>An Argument for Regional Self-Determination</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>How are beneficiaries best conceived? Many have construed Wilson's principle 
along nationalistic lines (for example, Cobban 1944, 19-22 and Feinberg 1970, 
45), but Wilson's language is less clear. The democratic ideal of popular 
sovereignty seemed foremost in his thinking when he first employed the term 
`self-determination' publicly in a 1918 speech, and this has little to do with 
national ties: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>People are not to be handed about from one sovereignty to another 
  by an international conference or an understanding between rivals and 
  antagonists. National aspirations must be respected; peoples may now be 
  dominated and governed only by their own consent. "Self-determination" is not 
  a mere phrase. It is an imperative principle of action, which statesmen will 
  henceforth ignore at their peril (Wilson 1927, 180).</BLOCKQUOTE>A more complete 
statement of the relevant principle came on July 4, 1918: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The settlement of every question, whether of territory, of 
  sovereignty, of economic arrangement, or of political relationship upon the 
  basis of the free acceptance of that settlement by the people immediately 
  concerned and not upon the basis of the material interest or advantage of any 
  other nation or people which may desire a different settlement for sake of its 
  own exterior influence or mastery (Wilson 1927, 233).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Who are "the people immediately concerned"? Two points are relevant in 
determining Wilson's intent. First, he spoke of self-determination more in terms 
of a political maxim to guide those "statesmen" entrusted with making decisions 
about the future status of given territories, and less of a "right" of peoples. 
Second, despite use of terms like 'peoples' and 'national,' Wilson spoke in 
regional terms when he said that the principle underlying the Paris Peace 
Conference was that "every land belonged to the native stock that lived in it" 
(Wilson 1927, 49). Apparently he envisioned the primary use of the principle 
would be to resolve questions concerning the status of <I>territories</I> 
unsettled by conflict or which are or previously had been under foreign 
domination.<SUP>13</SUP> 
<P>So conceived, the principle of self-determination is most relevant when 
applied to "unsettled territory," that is, to a region satisfying at least 
<I>one</I> of the following conditions: (i) was formerly dominated by another 
community but is currently free from that domination and not yet self-governing; 
(ii) is currently under some form of internationally sanctioned trusteeship; 
(iii) has been accorded the right of secession by a larger state of which it is 
presently a part; (iv) is under the domination of either a foreign community or 
an internal tyranny that threatens the human rights of its members; or (v) is 
under a real and present danger of such domination. The relevant form of the 
Wilsonian principle of (strict) self-determination can be phrased as follows: 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The legitimate residents of an unsettled territory shall be 
  permitted to constitute themselves as a self-governing unit upon qualifying as 
  a politically coherent community. Agents with the moral prerogative--whether 
  by circumstance or investiture--to affect what institutions prevail in that 
  territory, must ensure that self-governance is achieved through popular 
  consent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are limits upon the application of this principle; specifically, there 
must be institutional protection of individuals' human rights and of legitimate 
cultural interests of significant subgroups. It is not a <I>carte blanche</I> 
for majorities to establish objectional forms of discrimination and, therefore, 
not the sole or overriding normative principle relevant to decisions concerning 
the political status of disputed territories (see Emerson 1971, 466-7; Umozurike 
1972, 192; Pomerance 1984, 332-7; and Etzioni 1992-93, 34). 
<P>An argument for viewing regional self-determination as a norm of 
international justice is straightforward. Any political settlement in a 
territory must be responsive to what its established inhabitants take to be in 
their legitimate interests. By voluntarily binding themselves to a 
social-political arrangement, people impose upon themselves a moral obligation 
to abide by its terms and, in this way, chances are heightened that the 
arrangement will conform to what they perceive as just, if not to what is just. 
Prospects for stable peace and orderly development are thereby enhanced. 
Imposing an arrangement upon the inhabitants against their will, by contrast, 
creates resentment that threatens future instability. Thus, observing 
self-determination--whether construed as a political principle for solving 
conflicts over sovereignty, a legal right of groups, or a human right of 
individuals--is the crucial mechanism for securing governmental authority and 
the rule of law within a given territory. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>On National Self-Determination</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>The case for including within international morality a principle of 
<I>national</I> self-determination--each <I>people</I> is entitled to 
self-governance--can appeal to the rights of individuals to enjoy the benefits 
of participating in "the national life of their community," rights satisfiable 
through "the establishment of national institutions, the formation of autonomous 
communities, or the establishment of federal or confederal states" (Tamir 1993, 
75). A similar argument by Margalit and Raz (1990) is that since there is value 
to membership in a "self-encompassing" (national) group, including participation 
in the political activities of that group, then there is an inherent value in 
that group's being self-governing, though they are also concerned that such 
self-governance does not damage the "fundamental interests of [all] its 
inhabitants" and "the just interests of other countries" (457, 461). 
<P>That there is an inherent value in national self-determination cannot be 
disputed, but whenever we consider a proposed practical principle, we 
distinguish what it might yield if people were perfectly impartial from what it 
is likely to produce in practice. By definition, a nation-state is constituted 
for the sake of a specific people, and inevitably, its institutions, laws, and 
policies will reflect the culture of that people and favor their interests. Here 
are where the dangers lie. Few areas of the world are culturally homogenous, and 
the "unsettled" regions typically are not. A state that institutionalizes the 
values of a particular culture and not those of others invokes the dual risk of 
intolerance and officially-sanctioned discrimination. Since human beings are 
unlikely to abandon the habit of identifying with groups to which other 
collectives are unfavorably compared, the <I>de jure</I> favoring of the 
majority's cultural values is bound to be resented by minorities while posing a 
permanent threat to their interests. 
<P>Also, ethnic and cultural divisions tend to multiply over time. Is each 
people entitled to self-determination? If so, not only would secession movements 
proliferate, so would the number of incompatible claims to one and the same 
region. Either the problem concerning the <I>linkage</I> of people to territory 
would become an insurmountable hurdle for implementing national 
self-determination, or there would be an ever-increasing panorama of competing 
sovereignties (Etzioni 1992-93). Thus, establishing nation-states in culturally 
diverse regions poses a risk not only to individual human rights but to domestic 
and international political stability. 
<P>To avoid these problems, a regional rather than a national construal of the 
principle of self-determination should be favored in deciding the fate of 
unsettled territories. <I>Populations</I>, not <I>peoples</I>, are the proper 
beneficiaries. It does not follow, of course, that peoples are not relevant 
agents in international law or ethics, nor that national self-determination in a 
<I>broad</I> sense is undesirable. The point is that peoples should not be 
conceived as the possessors of <I>sovereignty</I>. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>The Palestine Mandate</B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>In the summer of 1919 President Wilson sent a commission headed by the 
prominent Americans Henry King and Charles Crane to investigate the political 
situation in the Near East. The commissioners' report, submitted to the Paris 
Peace Conference in August, argued that the wishes of Palestine's population 
must be decisive if the principle of self-determination is to rule. Since the 
non-Jewish population of Palestine--nearly nine-tenths of the whole--were 
"emphatically against the entire Zionist program," then, <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>To subject a people so minded to unlimited Jewish immigration, and 
  to steady financial and social pressure to surrender the land, would be a 
  gross violation of the principle just quoted and of the peoples' rights, 
  though it kept within the forms of law (Antonius 1965, 449.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>The report noted that "no British officer believed that the Zionist 
programme could be carried out except by the force of arms," and it recommended 
that the project for making Palestine a distinctly Jewish commonwealth be 
abandoned. Their report reached Wilson a day before his collapse and it is 
doubtful he read it. Lord Balfour's own response to the commissioners' 
recommendations was blunt: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form 
  of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country, though the 
  American Commission has been going through the form of asking what they are. 
  The Four Great Powers are committed to Zionism. And Zionism, be it right or 
  wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long traditions, in present needs, in 
  future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 
  700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land (Ingrams 1972, 
  73).<SUP>14</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B><I>International Recognition of Zionism</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>At the San Remo conference in 1920, the Supreme Allied Council of the 
victorious powers accorded Britain mandatory powers in Palestine. The terms of 
the Balfour Declaration were incorporated into its terms, the preamble noting 
the "historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine" and calling for 
a reconstitution of their "national home in that country." In 1921, Britain 
removed Trans-Jordan from the promises of the mandate, contrary to the wishes of 
the Zionist organization, and in 1922 the League of Nations officially awarded 
the mandate to Britain. The American Administration had already supported the 
Balfour Declaration in August 1918, and in 1922 the U.S. Congress endorsed an 
essentially similar document in a joint resolution. The result was that not only 
had the Balfour Declaration received support from two of the victorious powers 
in the war, it was also given <I>international sanction</I>. In the relatively 
short span of a quarter century, Zionism had taken a giant step towards 
realizing the principal aim set forth in its 1897 platform. Preparations for a 
Jewish state could now proceed under British protection until such a time as a 
decisive Jewish majority was established. 
<P>Through all this, the Palestinian Arabs had no hand in the decision which was 
to have a monumental impact upon their future; they were not consulted, no 
plebiscite was ever held, and no approval from Palestinian representatives ever 
secured.<SUP>15</SUP> Remarkably, the Mandate seemed at odds with Article 22 of 
the Covenant of the League of Nations which dealt with newly liberated 
territories. Its fourth paragraph stated: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish empire have 
  reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations 
  can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative 
  advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand 
  alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in 
  the selection of the Mandatory.<SUP>16</SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>Exceptions were specified in subsequent paragraphs of the Article, and 
since Palestine was not mentioned by name, the assumption is that it was covered 
in the fourth paragraph. Britain countered that Palestine was a special case, 
though in a 1922 White Paper was careful to qualify its position by stating that 
the Jewish national home is to be <I>in</I> Palestine and that there would be no 
disappearance or subordination of the Arab population or customs. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Immigration and Revolt</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>The Mandate added to Palestinian suspicions of British intentions and raised 
tensions between Jews and Arabs. Postwar attempts to bring the two sides 
together had come to failed and violence was not long in coming. By 1919, the 
Zionists were calling for an increase in armed Jewish force in Palestine, and in 
1920 rioting in Jerusalem took the lives of five Jews and four Arabs, with 
scores injured, while in the Galilee, eight Jews were killed in battle. In May 
1921 more serious disturbances took the lives of 47 Jews and 48 Arabs. The terms 
of the Mandate obliged Britain to open the doors of Palestine to Jewish 
immigration, which increased the Jewish presence to 17% of the population by the 
end of the decade. Tensions mounted, and in 1929 there were serious outbreaks of 
violence which included massacre of more than sixty members of Hebron's ancient 
Jewish community after local Arabs were told that Zionists had attacked the 
Jerusalem mosques. 
<P>In the 1930s, immigration jumped dramatically due to the ascension of the 
Nazi Party in Germany, reaching nearly 65,000 in 1935 and raising the percentage 
of Jews to 31% of the population by 1939. The Jewish Agency was founded in 1929 
to settle the new immigrants with whom came funds and agricultural expertise 
that allowed Zionist settlements to flourish and expand. Land purchases were 
supervised by the Jewish National Fund (founded in 1901) whose charter specified 
that land once acquired becomes the inalienable property of the Jewish people. 
In 1923 nearly 75% of the land worked by Arab peasants was owned by absentee 
landlords who lived in cities (Smith 1996, 84). Of the land Zionists purchased 
by 1945, sales by Palestinian peasants accounted for 9.4%, sales by Palestinian 
large landowners were 24.6%, and sales by non-Palestinian Arabs (Lebanese and 
Syrians) were 52.6% (Stein 1984, 226-27 and Khalidi 1988). The policy of 
redeeming the land with Jewish labor resulted in large numbers of Arab farm 
workers turned out of lands they had previously worked and forced to seek 
employment in cities. In 1933 the Arab Executive Committee declared that Jewish 
immigration "has terrified the country" (Khalidi 1984, 90). 
<P>These events severely dampened hopes for Jewish-Arab reconciliation. Leaders 
on both sides continued to seek rapproachment though, like Jabotinsky, 
Palestinian politicians such as Awni Abd'l Hadi and George Antonious eventually 
concluded that agreement was impossible. The discovery that Zionists were 
smuggling arms into the country caused men like Sheikh `Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a 
religious leader in Haifa, to advocate open revolt against British rule and 
Zionist Colonialism. He was killed in November 1935 during a battle between his 
guerilla group and British forces, but his "martyrdom" was a call to action 
inspiring the newly formed Arab Higher Committee to organize a general strike to 
press demands for halting Jewish immigration, prohibiting land sales to Jews, 
and forming a representative government. The strike evolved into the 1936-39 
revolt with Arab fighters arrayed against Jewish communities and the British 
military. The superior armaments of the latter prevailed; by the time violence 
ceased, 101 British soldiers, 463 Jews, and over 5000 Arabs had lost their 
lives. 
<P>Yet the Revolt altered British policy. Realizing that Arabs would never 
peacefully acquiesce to the imposition of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Peel 
Commission of 1937 recommended a partition of the country into an Arab and a 
Jewish state, despite arguments by the former High Commissioner for Palestine, 
Herbert Samuel, that two states with interwoven territories would be bound in an 
endless struggle. The plan was rejected by both sides. In 1939, after exiling 
Palestinian leaders, Britain issued a White Paper calling for the establishment 
of a single state within ten years in which Arabs and Jews would share authority 
in government. Jewish immigration would be limited to 75,000 persons within the 
next five years, and thereafter no immigrant would be admitted without Arab 
approval. The High Commissioner was empowered to regulate, delimit, or prohibit 
transfer of Arab land to Jewish ownership, and Palestine was to be partitioned 
into Arab, Jewish and neutral zones under one Administration. Britain justified 
its action by a study of the McMahon-Hussein correspondence, concluding that it 
was not free to disregard wishes of the Palestinian Arabs (Cattan 1969, 260). 
<P>Neither Arabs nor Zionists found the White Paper to their liking. Arabs 
rejected its authorization of continued Jewish immigration while the Jewish 
Agency accused Britain of "a breach of faith and surrender to Arab terrorism" 
(Laqueur 1976, 76). Although the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of 
Nations declared the 1939 White Paper to be incompatible with the terms of the 
Mandate, Britain did not rescind it. In response, Zionists intensified 
preparations for future armed conflict and redoubled political efforts in the 
United States. In 1942, they issued a statement calling for fulfillment of the 
promises of the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate, opening of the gates of 
Palestine to immigration, and establishment in Palestine of a Jewish 
Commonwealth which would right the "age-old wrong to the Jewish people" (Laqueur 
1976, 79). This so-called `Biltmore program' was successful in generating 
additional support within both political parties and among Americans 
generally--though Buber criticized its design to "conquer" Palestine through 
international maneuvers (Arendt 1978, 211). Immediately after the war, Congress 
passed a resolution calling for Palestine to be "opened for free entry of Jews", 
and in August 1946 Truman pledged the Administration's support for Zionism 
despite opposition from the State Department. Truman's endorsement was 
equivalent to the Balfour Declaration in 1917 (Khalidi 1971, 64). The subsequent 
UN partition plan, like the Palestine Mandate, was a direct result of a 
superpower taking the Zionist movement under its wing. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>The Debate at the United Nations</B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>In 1947 Palestine contained approximately 1.35 million Arabs and 650,000 
Jews, and only in the district around the city of Tel Aviv did Jewish numbers 
exceed that of the Arabs. Over half of the Jews had immigrated since 1919. Jews 
had acquired roughly six percent of mandated territory, though their percentage 
was higher in the agricultural areas along the coast and in the Galilee. 
<P>The situation had grown more intense. The Nazi genocide of Jews had stunned 
the world, generating greater sympathy for the establishment of a Jewish state 
and increased demands for Palestine to be opened to Jewish immigration. 
Britain's refusal prompted direct conflict with Jewish underground militias, the 
Irgun Z'vai Le'umi and LEHI groups. Assassination, hangings, and bombings--the 
most spectacular of which was the Irgun's demolition of British headquarters in 
1946--marked the conflict. Britain responded by applying a stringent set of 
Defence Laws, initially devised to counter the Arab Revolt, and accusing the 
Jewish Agency of condoning terrorism. Opposition of Palestinian Arabs to Zionism 
remained as strong as ever, their hopes lifted by the 1945 formation of the Arab 
League which supported their aspirations. However, the Palestinian leadership 
was fragmented (Lesch 1979, Khalaf 1991), and a leading spokesman, the exiled 
Al-Hajj Amin Husseini, had discredited himself by backing Germany during the 
war--though Palestinians had generally favored Britain. The Palestinians were 
decidedly less successful than the Jewish Community in preparing for future 
conflict. 
<P>In May 1946, an Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry recommended that until 
Arab-Jewish hostility diminishes, the government of Palestine should be 
continued under mandate pending execution of a UN-sponsored trusteeship 
agreement. Palestine should be neither a Jewish nor an Arab state, a 
recommendation that satisfied neither party. When the Truman Administration 
renewed calls for immediate immigration of 100,000 Jewish refugees into 
Palestine, Britain, exhausted by war and frustrated by opposition, announced it 
would end its administration of Palestine by May 1948. Foreign Secretary Ernst 
Bevin declared that there was no prospect for compromise between the two 
communities. In 1947 the problem of Palestine was taken up by the United Nations 
which created a special committee (UNSCOP) to make recommendations to the 
General Assembly. A number of arguments were heard that continue to be relevant 
to on-going normative debates. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>The Case for Establishment of a Jewish State</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>A <I>combination</I> of considerations were advanced in favor of a Jewish 
state. The argument from "historical connection" has already been mentioned, but 
in 1947 Zionists could point to additional factors. Of central importance was 
their contention that the Palestine Mandate constituted legal recognition of 
Jewish national rights in Palestine: "The Balfour Declaration became a binding 
and unchallengeable international obligation from the moment when it was 
embodied in the Palestine Mandate" (Feinberg 1974, 242). This "right" to 
establish a "national home" in Palestine was preserved by the UN Charter whose 
Article 80 stipulates that nothing be done to alter the rights "of any states or 
any peoples" in territories currently under mandate. Hence, the world community 
is obligated to honor the commitments of the Mandate. 
<P>But an older argument resurfaced with greater weight than ever before. The 
Nazi genocide of the Jews strengthened the moral case for the Zionist insistence 
that as perpetual outsiders without sovereign power of their own, the survival 
of the Jews will continually be under threat. "Hitler is gone now," argued Moshe 
Shertok (Sharett), "but not anti-Semitism . . . Anti-Semitism in Germany and in 
many other parts of Europe is a rife as ever and potentially militant and 
fierce. . . . The very age of European Jewry serves only to accentuate the basic 
historic insecurity of Jewish life in the dispersion" (Robinson 1947, 212). 
Since it is a matter of "life or death" that Jews be allowed into Palestine 
(Jewish Agency 1947, 514), and since the Jewish community there has proved 
itself capable of political and economic independence, then Palestine is the 
natural place for a sovereign Jewish state. This state would be able to absorb 
an influx of some 400,000 Jewish refugees from Europe and soon become a "pillar 
of progress in the Near East" (Robinson 1947, 214). 
<P>A related argument was anchored on the Lockean premise that the land belongs 
to those who develop it. It was popularized by Labor Zionists like A.D. Gordon 
(Taylor 1974, 93) and Ben-Gurion (Gorny 1987, 210), but also impressed the more 
conciliatory. For instance, Buber wrote, "Ask the soil what the Arabs have done 
for her in 1300 years and what we have done for her in 50. Would her answer not 
be weighty testimony in a just discussion as to whom this land belongs?" 
(Shimoni 1995, 348), and Hannah Arendt felt this argument was "better and more 
convincing" than considerations of the Jews' "desperate situation in Europe" 
(Arendt 1978, 173). 
<P>Weizmann advanced a balance of justice argument. Both Arabs and Jews have a 
legitimate claim to Palestine. In depriving the Jews of a state, however, you 
deprive all the world's Jews of independence and nationhood, whereas in refusing 
to create another Arab state in Palestine you do not deprive all Arabs of 
political independence. According to Feinberg (1970) this reasoning "turned the 
scale in favour of the Zionist solution of the Palestine Problem," for the 
minute territorial allocation that a Jewish state entailed would not be a 
hardship placed upon Arabs in the context of the Arab Middle East (53). Shertok 
added that its Arab citizens would not only retain their association with the 
Arab world but would enjoy the rights of citizenship in a Jewish commonwealth as 
"there is nothing inherent in the nature of either the native Arab or the 
immigrant Jew which prevents friendly cooperation" (Robinson 1947, 213). When 
the Arab claim is weighed against the international promises to Jews, the 
achievements of 50 years of Jewish settlement, recurrent antisemitism, and the 
current plight of Jewish refugees, then the route of least injustice favors 
establishment of a Jewish state.<SUP>17</SUP> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>The Arab Case</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>For their part, the Arabs repeated that no credibility be given to the 
argument for historical title on the basis on distant historical connection. 
Aside from the statue of limitations consideration, most modern-day Jews cannot 
claim descendence from the Jews of biblical times and, hence, have not inherited 
a claim from those who were previously dispossessed.<SUP>18</SUP> Before the 
General Assembly, Arabs like Henry Cattan (Palestine), Faris al-Khouri (Syria), 
and Fadhil Jamali (Iraq) argued that appealing to historical connection in 
settling international issues, <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . would mean redrawing the map of the whole world. It has been 
  said you cannot set back the hands of the clock of history by twenty years. 
  What should then be said when an effort is made to set the clock of history 
  back by twenty centuries in a an attempt to give away a country on the grounds 
  of a transitory historic association? (Robinson 1947, 227).</BLOCKQUOTE>If 
historical connection is relevant at all, it is certainly the Arabs who have the 
stronger case since they have been the established majority in Palestine during 
the more recent centuries. No amount of propaganda, said Cattan, can alter the 
Arab character of Palestine's history and culture. Arabs have done the greater 
part in developing the land, establishing its citrus and olive groves, and 
building its terraces, its villages, its cities. The assumption that they had 
let its land lay fallow and the country undeveloped is as much a distortion as 
the earlier myth that the land was "empty." Even if Jews have done well with the 
sectors they own, the argument that development grants title could be used to 
justify any aggression of a technologically advanced society against a more 
"backward" people. 
<P>As for the lesser injustice, while it may be true that Jewish refugees need a 
home, this is not to be granted at the expense of those who were not responsible 
for Nazi actions. That the refugees be settled in Palestine against the wishes 
of Arab residents would be an injustice to the majority and a violation of a 
1946 General Assembly resolution concerning resettlement of displaced persons. 
In measuring the injustice of alternative proposals, Arabs would stand to lose 
more by creation of a Jewish state since they outnumber Jews by two-to-one and 
hold the bulk of its property. The 1919 King-Crane commission had correctly 
predicted that the pressures of Jewish capital would result in the displacement 
of many poorer Arabs, while others would find economic and political 
opportunities blocked. "No room can be made in Palestine for a second nation," 
concluded Albert Hourani in 1946, "except by dislodging or exterminating the 
first" (Smith 1996, 130). Not only would Palestinian Arabs be affected; the 
Anglo-American Committee emphasized that a Jewish state in Palestine would give 
a non-Arab power control of the only land bridge between the western and eastern 
halves of the Arab world, disrupting the latter's communications and territorial 
unity.<SUP>19</SUP> 
<P>Finally, sovereignty is an inalienable possession of the inhabitants of a 
territory and a Trusteeship only temporarily suspends its exercise (Cattan 1969, 
252-253). The "commitments" and "guarantees" of the Balfour Declaration and 
Palestine Mandate cannot override the rights of the indigenous Palestinian 
inhabitants which derive from more fundamental principles. In 1946 Akram 
Zuaiter, a prominent Palestinian politician, appealed to self-determination as a 
<I>moral</I> principle, insisting that Palestinians have a "natural right" to 
self-governance that is not dependent upon the promises of the British, the 
Americans, or international bodies (Zuaiter 1994, 272). The philosopher W.T. 
Stace argued in the same vein: self-determination provides "the only "abstract" 
or "moral" principle which is needed for the adjudication of the Palestine 
controversy," and it "will not be outdated a year from now or in fifty years" 
(Stace 1947, 83). It is "aggression" for an external agent to neglect the wishes 
of the majority and their "natural right of self-determination" in favor of an 
alternative arrangement. The Arab Higher Committee added that Jews legitimately 
entitled to reside in Palestine have every right to share in its 
self-determination, but, <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>". . . foreign residents of diverse nationalities, mostly of the 
  Jewish faith, can under no legal or moral justification, be entitled to a say 
  in the formation of this government . . . This, in short, is our legal 
  position in Palestine. As the overwhelming majority, we possess the 
  unquestionable right of sovereignty over the country (1948, 
11-12).</BLOCKQUOTE>Since Palestine's legitimate residents opposed both the 
Balfour Declaration and the Mandate provisions from the very outset and have 
persisted in their opposition to the present day, then imposition of a Jewish 
state upon them would be an unmistakable denial of self-determination. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Rejoinder on Self-Determination</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>The appeal to self-determination is double-edged, as British Foreign 
Secretary Lord Curzon noted in 1918; "both Arabs and Zionists are prepared to 
make every use of it they can" (Lloyd-George 1939, 739-40). At times, Ben-Gurion 
argued that the right of self-determination may be overridden (Jewish Agency 
1947, 384), but other members of the Jewish Agency maintained that it is a 
misconception to view the Palestine Mandate as violating the principle of 
self-determination. Any beneficiary of self-determination must demonstrate 
itself to be a viable political unit, and unlike the Arabs of Palestine, the 
Jews have been recognized by the international community as having achieved this 
status. Echoing earlier arguments of Jabotinsky (Shimoni 1995, 367), the Agency 
contended that the right of self-determination should not be looked upon as 
applying to static populations alone, but as a mechanism for rectifying ancient 
wrongs and giving unpossessed peoples a share in the world's land and resources. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>If there was justice in the general concept of self-determination, 
  there was also justice in the particular expression of that concept in terms 
  of the "historic reparation" to Jewry. No man of liberal spirit could deny 
  that it was justice long-delayed. Nor could he gainsay the right of his people 
  to find its way once more into the society of nations (Jewish Agency 1947, 
  110).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>The Zionist argument for self-determination can be summarized as follows: 
(1) Jews, as a people capable of political independence, meet the necessary and 
sufficient conditions for being a beneficiary of self-determination. (2) 
Palestine is the only territory to which Jews as such have historical, cultural, 
legal, and moral ties. (3) Palestine is <I>not</I> the only area to which Arabs 
have such linkages (Gorny 1987, 213-14). (4) There is (in 1947) "no identifiable 
Palestinian Arab people" who have emerged as a viable political unit with 
international recognition whose own national aspirations for independence would 
suffer upon creation of a Jewish state (Jewish Agency 1947, 325, 384). 
Therefore, Jews are entitled to a sovereign state in Palestine. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Comment on the Rejoinder</I></B> 
<P>The first premise of the argument is plausible only on a principle of 
national self-determination. On a regional interpretation the premise is false 
since self-determination is not to be conferred on peoples. Instead, it belongs 
to the entire community of legitimate residents and in 1947 the Jewish 
inhabitants of Palestine--only one-third of the population at best--were not the 
exclusive beneficiary. In fact, the claim for regional self-determination <I>in 
Palestine</I> by the majority of Palestine's inhabitants had been strengthened 
during the period of the Mandate. In 1919 it was by no means clear that the 
inhabitants of Palestine were entitled to self-determination <I>qua</I> 
inhabitants of Palestine rather than being part of a larger regional unit. The 
effect of the British Mandate was to isolate Palestine, keeping it under 
trusteeship while the rest of the Arab world gained independence. Since the vast 
majority of its population contested the Mandate's provisions, Palestine 
remained an "unsettled" area for the next quarter-century and, arguably, its 
inhabitants acquired "national aspirations" and were as capable of other Arabs 
of political independence. This discredits the fourth premise of the argument 
<I>even if</I> the logic of national self-determination is retained. But 
according to the regional principle, not only is the first premise false, the 
argument is invalid due to the presence of a majority of Arabs. At the very 
least, adherence to that principle would have called for a plebiscite on the 
partition proposal whose result would have been contrary to Zionist ambitions. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Partition, Independence, Catastrophe</I></B> 
<P>Palestine has become the acid test of human conscience. The United Nations 
will find that upon their decision will depend the future of humanity, whether 
humanity is going to proceed by peaceful means or whether humanity is going to 
be torn to pieces. If a wrong decision flows from this august Assembly, you may 
take it from me that the world shall be cut in twain and there shall be no peace 
upon earth.<SUP>20</SUP> <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>In the autumn of 1947 UNSCOP issued both majority and minority 
recommendations. The minority proposal, claiming that the provisions of the 
Mandate were inconsistent with the League of Nations Covenant, called for a 
binational state. It was rejected by Arabs who denied a parity between Arab and 
Jewish political claims, and by the Jewish Agency which argued that a binational 
solution would result in constant political deadlock and reliance upon external 
parties (Jewish Agency 1947, 130-135, 345, 549). The majority proposal 
recommended partition of Palestine into two states, a Jewish state on 
approximately 56% of the mandated territory and an Arab state on 43%, with 
Jerusalem to be placed under international administration (see Map). Arabs would 
lose control of the rich costal plain which produced their most valuable export, 
citrus fruit, while the central highlands would be excluded from the Jewish 
state. The plan was adopted by the General Assembly on November 29, 1947 as 
Resolution 181 (II) with a vote of thirty-three in favor, thirteen against, and 
ten abstentions. 
<P>Although the plan fell short of their aims, the Jewish Agency acquiesced. The 
Arabs rejected it arguing that the United Nations had no right to grant any 
portion of Arab territory to Zionists, and that the Western world was making 
them pay for the suffering of Jews. It was, at the time, unreasonable to expect 
Arabs to accept what they regarded as a "grotesquely skewed misallocation" (Ball 
1992, 21, and Khalaf 1991, 245-46). There were no negotiations between the two 
communities--neither Jew nor Arab would acknowledge the existence of the other 
(Cunningham 1948, 481)--and fighting immediately broke out. By April 1948 the 
better-equipped and more numerous Jewish forces established a clear superiority, 
securing their recommended allotment while capturing territory assigned to the 
proposed Arab state. Civilians on both sides were targeted, but massacres like 
that at the Arab village of Deir Yassin (over 250 people) by Jewish irregulars 
precipitated a wide-scale exodus of Arabs from their homes and villages. 
<P>On May 15, the day after Israel declared its independence, forces from Egypt, 
Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq entered the fighting. Despite population 
differences, Israelis placed more soldiers in the field, and had the advantage 
of working in familiar terrain under unified control. UN-sponsored truces in the 
summer provided belligerents the opportunity to re-arm, while the UN mediator, 
Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden, recommended immediate repatriation of the Arab 
refugees as a condition for any just and lasting peace. His assassination in 
September by members of the Jewish underground was followed by renewed fighting 
in October which lasted until early 1949. When the last armistice was signed in 
July, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had taken over 77% of mandated Palestine, 
including West Jerusalem and the Galilee. The remainder was occupied by Jordan 
(West Bank and East Jerusalem) and Egypt (Gaza Strip). Palestinian Arabs were 
not permitted to establish a state and at least 750,000 became refugees through 
flight or expulsion by Israeli forces.<SUP>21</SUP> The long-debated "transfer" 
alternative had now become reality; for Palestinians, the massive dislocation 
was, simply, their Catastrophe (<I>al-Nakba</I>). Although a General Assembly 
Resolution of 1948 stated that refugees "should be permitted to return to their 
homes and live at peace with their neighbors," chances for peace in 1949 were 
lost when Israel refused Arab demands for withdrawal to the partition plan 
boundaries and return of refugees. Israel countered that Arab countries had 
waged war in defiance of the international community and that they could absorb 
Arab refugees just as the Israel was now accepting Jewish refugees not only from 
Europe, but also from the Middle East and north Africa (numbering 335,000 from 
1949-1952). <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>The Existence and Legitimacy of States</B> 
<P>Under what conditions can a state be said to exist? How does it gain 
legitimacy? When does a claim for statehood merit international recognition? 
Each of these questions has been relevant since declarations of independence by 
Israel in May 1948 and, subsequently, by the Palestine National Council in 
November 1988. From its inception Israel has satisfied the minimal conditions 
necessary for the <I>existence</I> of a state, specifically, a permanent 
population, a fixed geographical territory in which the population resides, and 
exercise of independent organized governmental control over the population 
within that territory. Although Arabs have at various times denied the 
legitimacy of Israel, statehood is more a matter of fact rather than of right. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Legitimacy</I></B> 
<P>The question of <I>legitimacy</I> concerns sovereign power and the implied 
entitlement to recognition. It can be raised at two levels; whether the state 
was legitimately <I>established</I> and whether the state is legitimately 
<I>constituted</I>, that is, whether its basic laws and institutions conform to 
minimal demands of justice, for example, observance of human rights and the 
sovereignty of other nations. Israel's legitimacy has been challenged at both 
levels. 
<P>Upon declaring its independence, Israel was soon recognized by many 
countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union, and was admitted to 
the United Nations in 1949. Recognition is certainly <I>a</I> criterion of 
legitimacy, though in the first thirty years of its existence, Arab states 
refused recognition on the grounds that Israel had been imposed upon the 
Palestinian majority,<SUP>22</SUP> and had seized territory in excess of the 
area specified in the partition plan. Whether the Partition Resolution itself 
yields an argument that Israel's establishment was legitimate is a matter of 
debate. Without the power to convey sovereignty the recommendations of the 
General Assembly were not binding (Brownlie 1990, 172-173). Although the 
International Court of Justice declared in 1950 that the Assembly was the 
legally qualified successor to the League of Nations with a right to carry out 
supervisory functions over the mandated territories, it emphasized that mandates 
were created in the interests of the inhabitants of the mandated territory 
(Brownlie 1990, 567). Further, the Partition Resolution violated the principle 
of self-determination (Cattan 1969, 1976; Bassouni 1974; Mallison &amp; Mallison 
1989)--one of the few mechanisms for establishing states by law rather than 
force (Crawford 1979, 84-85). 
<P>Feinberg (1970) and Stone (1981) have argued that the Palestine Mandate was 
itself an application of the principle of self-determination, and the Partition 
Resolution merely confirmed the "natural and historic right" of the Jewish 
people in Palestine. The fact that the Arabs of Palestine later distinguished 
themselves as a national group with a claim for self-determination--not until 
the 1960s--is "neither a juridical nor moral basis for undoing that initial 
application of President Wilson's self-determination principle after World War 
I" (Stone 1981, 58). Thus, regardless of the moral merits of the Partition 
Resolution or the Mandate, that these agreements <I>have received</I> 
international sanction creates an obligation to respect them. But apart from 
this, the mode of establishment becomes increasingly irrelevant to a state's 
legitimacy as it gains recognition, enters into agreements, develops its 
institutions, and extends its protection to newly born generations which had 
nothing to do with its emergence. After nearly fifty years, doubts about the 
justice of Israel's establishment may have been overridden by time. 
<P>However, a state's legitimacy also depends also on its <I>character</I>. 
Israel prides itself on being both a democracy and a Jewish homeland. While its 
Declaration of Independence asserts that it is "the natural right of the Jewish 
people to lead, as do all other nations, an independent existence in its 
sovereign State," it also proclaims that Israel "will uphold the full social and 
political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of religion, race, 
or sex." But Israel has fallen short of this latter ideal. Though one-sixth of 
its citizens are non-Jews, it remains a <I>Jewish</I> state. Its official 
symbols are Jewish religious symbols, and statutes governing land ownership and 
the Law of Return explicitly favor Jews over non-Jews.<SUP>23</SUP> Successive 
Israeli governments have discriminated against Arabs in areas of education, 
municipal funding, and economic development (Jiryis 1976, Lustick 1980). 
<P>The irony which has accompanied Zionism throughout remains; to solve one case 
of prejudice against a cultural minority it has effectively generated another. 
<I>If</I> a state's legitimacy forbids its basic institutions from <I>de 
jure</I> discrimination against cultural minorities, then the Jewish state--like 
any state favoring one religious, ethnic, or national constituency over 
another--is illegitimate. To be sure, this antecedent takes us back to the 
debate on national self-determination. Whatever its outcome, Israel is a young 
country--it remains without a constitution--and perhaps it can find a way of 
fusing democratic ideals with those of a "Jewish" state in which the problems of 
discrimination will be overcome. In 1991, the General Assembly acknowledged this 
possibility by rescinding its 1975 resolution describing Zionism as a form of 
racism, partly because of pressure by the United States, but partly because of a 
growing recognition that a realistic compromise is possible. In the eyes of much 
of the world, Israel has gained legitimacy if it did not possess it at the 
outset. Yet unless it can find some creative way of harmonizing its national 
character with equitable relations to the Arabs, the character of its symbols, 
laws, and institutions will keep the question of Israel's legitimacy alive. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Expansion</I></B> 
<P>The defeat of Arab forces in the 1947-49 War fostered revolutionary movements 
in the Arab world, notably in Egypt, where Gamal Abd'l Nasser assumed power in 
1952. His resolve in the face of the Anglo-Franco-Israeli invasion of 1956 and 
his insistence that Israel is an alien presence created and sustained by Western 
imperialism eliminable only through a unified Arab front, made him one of the 
more prominent figures in the Arab world for over fifteen years. Yet he 
miscalculated when he blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, replaced UN troops in the 
Sinai with two divisions of Egyptian soldiers, and concluded a defense treaty 
with Jordan in late May of 1967, unwittingly providing Israel with a <I>casus 
belli</I>. Israel's attack on June 5 destroyed Egypt's airforce and routed the 
exposed Egyptian forces in the Sinai, most of which it captured within three 
days. After fighting broke out in Jerusalem, Israel quickly overpowered the 
light Jordanian forces, occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank by June 8, and 
the Golan Heights by June 11. Nearly one-fifth of the West Bank population fled, 
finding borders sealed upon attempting to return.<SUP>24</SUP> 
<P>The real victory for Israel was not damage to Arab military capacity--this 
was quickly restored--but capture of territory later used for political and 
economic ends, a public relations bonanza bringing increased Western support and 
Jewish immigration, and defeat of a popular brand of Arab nationalism. Security 
Council Resolution 242 (November 1967) called for mutual recognition of all 
states in the region and Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories. But Arab 
countries were unwilling to negotiate after the humiliating defeat and Israel 
denied that the resolution requires withdrawal from all the territories. For 
thirty years, Israel has remained in the occupied territories, ruling what is by 
now over two million Palestinians. In the eyes of the world community, its 
presence there is subject to international law dealing with belligerent 
occupancy, specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 (see, for example, 
Security Council Resolution 446 of March 1979). Allowing for measures of 
military necessity, the Convention forbids alterations of the legal system, 
forcible transfer or deportation of the resident populous, and resettlement by 
the occupying power of its own civilian population within the occupied 
territory. Israel has violated these provisions, but contested their application 
on the grounds that the West Bank (in particular) is "disputed" or "unallocated" 
rather than the occupied territory of a nation which is party to the Convention. 

<P>The most contentious aspects of the occupation are Israel's settlements and 
land expropriation. Though initially confined to sparsely populated areas and 
large neighborhoods around East Jerusalem, civilian settlements were soon 
established near heavily populated areas in the West Bank, a tendency 
accelerated by the Likud government of Menachem Begin. Some settlements were 
built on land formerly under Jordanian control, but wide tracts of private Arab 
land were also confiscated. In 1979 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that 
requisition of Arab-owned land for civilian settlements was lawful if it 
furthered the security of the occupying forces and occupied areas.<SUP>25</SUP> 
<P>In its plan for development of settlement in Judea and Samaria 1979-83, the 
World Zionist Organization said that "settlement throughout the entire Land of 
Israel is for security and by right" (Mallison &amp; Mallison 1989, 446). In 
1980, the Government of Israel defended its settlement policy by challenging 
Jordan's claim to sovereignty in the West Bank, and by citing the Mandate 
provisions which permitted Jewish settlement in Palestine.<SUP>26</SUP> Israel 
has frequently cited security concerns to justify control over the West Bank, 
but as Shlomo Avineri observes, in "the era of missiles launched from distances 
of hundreds or thousands of kilometers, holding on to the West Bank or refugee 
camps in the Gaza Strip has no security significance" (<I>Ha'aretz</I>, 16 
January, 1996). The more likely reasons are resources--Israel takes one-third of 
its water from the West Bank--and <I>lebensraum</I>. Apart from the eastern 
sectors of Jerusalem, Israel has not annexed the West Bank or the Gaza Strip 
but, instead, followed a policy of creating "facts" to make it increasingly 
difficult for any future Israeli government to envision a complete pullout. 
According to a UN report in summer 1995, Israel has taken possession of 73% of 
the West Bank alone, with over 17,500 acres confiscated since the Oslo Agreement 
in September 1993. There are over 140 settlements in the West Bank and 20 in the 
Gaza Strip. More than 300,000 Israeli Jews have been settled in the territory 
taken in 1967, approximately 160,000 in East Jerusalem, 140,000 in West Bank 
settlements, and 6000 in Gaza (<I>The Jerusalem Times</I> 18 August, 1995). The 
settlers themselves are differently motivated; some take advantage of government 
subsidized housing while the more ideologically committed act to hasten the 
incorporation of all "Eretz Israel" (the Land of Israel) into the Jewish state. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>Resistance, Retaliation, Representations</B> 
<P>In the first half century of conflict, much of the inter-communal violence 
was waged not on battlefields but in market places, villages, refugee camps, 
city streets and buses, with victims being not only those who have taken up arms 
but civilians. After Israel declared independence in 1948, one side gained the 
apparatus of state power and a modern military. As the Palestinians regrouped in 
the 1960s, the arena and methods of struggle broadened, but civilians on both 
sides continued to bear the brunt of bullets and bombs. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>The Recourse to Violence</I></B> 
<P>Israelis and Palestinians alike have cited self-defense in their recourse to 
arms. Some have also argued that violence has produced desired political 
results, whether in terms of weakening a political adversary, gaining 
concessions, attracting attention to one's cause, or unifying one's own 
community. As the Palestinians could cite the impact of their resistance on 
British policy in 1939, a similar argument was available to Jews in the 1940s. 
In articulating his "iron wall" strategy, for example, Jabotinsky justified 
"retaliation" against Arab attacks even when this involved civilians: "The 
choice is between . . . retaliating against the hostile population or not 
retaliating at all" (Schechtman 1961, 480). To Menachem Begin, who headed the 
Irgun after Jabotinsky's death, it was the armed revolt against the mandatory 
government that paved the way for creation of the state of Israel. Though Begin 
denied any massacre of Arab civilians had occurred at Deir Yasin, he 
acknowledged that the story "invented" about what happened there "helped carve 
the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield" (Begin 1977, 165). Yitzhak 
Shamir of LEHI also justified the use of terror: ". . . terrorism is for us a 
part of the political battle being conducted under the present circumstances, 
and it has a great part to play . . . it proclaims our war against the occupier" 
(Talhami 1990, 236).<SUP>27</SUP> 
<P>In 1946, the Arab Higher Committee predicted that Jewish terrorist 
organizations will give rise to similar organizations by the Arabs. Frustrated 
by the lack of respect for UN resolutions calling for their repatriation, a few 
Palestinian refugees took up arms in the early 1950s in raids against Israeli 
settlements. Organized resistance materialized only in the late 1950s with the 
founding of <I>Al-Fatah</I>. In 1964 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
was established as an umbrella organization to unite a variety of Palestinian 
groups. Its charter called for an end to the state of Israel, a return of 
Palestinians to their homeland, and establishment of a single democratic state 
throughout Palestine. Initially led by politicians, but the ascendance of 
<I>Al-Fatah's</I> Yasir Arafat to the chairmanship in 1969 revealed that engine 
of the PLO lay in its military wing. 
<P>The 1967 war marked a sharp rise in Palestinians' self-consciousness, 
convincing many that if their homeland was to be liberated then it was 
<I>they</I> who must do it. Outgunned and outmanned by the Israeli military, 
their fighters resorted to guerilla tactics from staging grounds in Jordan and 
Lebanon. Some, like George Habash of the PFLP--the "Palestinian mirror image of 
Jabotinsky" (Al-Azm 1988, 98)--spoke of turning the occupied territories into an 
"inferno whose fires consume the usurpers" (Hirst 1984, 282). While this did not 
happen, by 1969 the activities of Habash and others were in the international 
spotlight as a consequence of cross-border raids and airplane hijackings. No 
incident was more spectacular than the hostage-taking by the Black September 
group which led to the deaths of eleven Israeli athletes and five Palestinian 
commandos during the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. Israel's response was not 
only to pursue PLO activists abroad, but to bomb targets in Jordan, Syria and 
Lebanon. The civilian casualties in these airraids far exceeded those of the 
incursions that prompted them; after Munich between 200-500 people, mainly 
civilians, were killed (Hirst 1984, 251, and see Khalidi 1989 for additional 
casualty figures). 
<P>Recourse to arms brought mixed results. On one hand, Palestinians were 
branded as "terrorists" in the Western press, and accorded little sympathy after 
Israeli reprisals. On the other, their resistance restored a measure of 
self-respect and confidence, publicized their grievances--after 20 long years of 
neglect by the world community--and gained them recognition. Those who argue 
against the legitimacy of terrorism must confront the fact that victims of 
oppression often have no other option than to confront a militarily superior 
enemy in order to gain the attention of an otherwise indifferent world. To some 
extent it worked for the Palestinians: the world awakened to the Palestinian 
situation after twenty years of neglect. Within the Arab world the impact was 
much greater; at the Rabat Conference in 1974, Arab leaders affirmed that the 
PLO is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and later 
that year the General Assembly recognized the Palestinians' rights to 
self-determination, national independence, and sovereignty. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>War and Massacre</I></B> 
<P>Diplomatic gains in the 1970s reinforced Palestinian willingness to accept a 
two-state solution of the conflict, but the Israeli Government of Menachem Begin 
opposed any compromise with the PLO. With his Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, 
Begin planned to destroy the PLO infrastructure in Lebanon. The IDF invaded in 
June 1982, and after devastating Palestinian population centers in the south of 
Lebanon and forcing a large exodus of Lebanese northwards into Beirut, besieged 
West Beirut for two months. Entrenched PLO fighters foiled an Israeli attempt to 
enter West Beruit in early August, and on August 12 the IDF responded with a 
massive aerial bombardment which was halted only with the intervention of U.S. 
President Reagan. The Americans then arranged an evacuation of nearly 12,000 PLO 
fighters in late August. 
<P>On September 12, Lebanon's new president, Bashir Gemayel, agreed to Israel's 
request that Phalangist forces--a militia from one of Lebanon's Maronite 
faction--eliminate the 2000 "terrorists" which Israelis claimed were still in 
Beirut's refugee camps. On September 14, Gemayel was killed in a powerful 
explosion, and a day later the IDF moved into West Beruit in violation of the 
evacuation agreement, sealing off the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps with 
tanks. Sharon authorized entry of the Lebanese militia on September 16 and for 
the next 38 hours, aided by Israeli flares at night, the militiamen raped, 
mutilated and massacred civilians. The International Red Cross gave a figure of 
2400 killed or unaccounted for (Ang 1989, 72), but some bodies had been buried 
before evacuating and sources among both Phalangists and Palestinians claimed 
that at least 3000 people had perished (Hirst 1984, 428). Among the dead, none 
could be identified as members of any PLO military unit. 
<P>The massacre was a wild suspension of law and morality, and the interesting 
normative questions concern the scope and degree of responsibility. The killers 
entered the camps at the behest of Israeli officials who were certainly aware of 
Phalangist hostility towards Palestinians. An Israeli commission of inquiry 
ridiculed the claim that a massacre was not foreseen by Israeli officials, 
especially after Gemayel's assassination, and concluded that "indirect 
responsibility" rested on the shoulders of Sharon, IDF commanders, Foreign 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and Prime Minister Begin. Presumably, the qualifier 
"indirect" was based on the assumption that Israeli soldiers did not actually do 
the killing. Yet, allowing the revenge-seeking Lebanese Forces into the camps 
suggests "complicity in genocide"<SUP>28</SUP> if not outright instigation. In 
other circumstances, those responsible--directly or indirectly--would have been 
convicted of war crimes. 
<P>Some have argued that Israel's invasion was an act of self-defense against 
Palestinian terrorism and the PLO's avowed aim to eliminate Israel, and that the 
amount of force "was proportionate to the goal of expelling the PLO" (O'Brien 
1991, 209). But an armed attack on Israel from the PLO was not even imminent 
since for the PLO had honored a 1981 agreement to cease cross-border 
hostilities, and was receptive to political compromise. Although the presence of 
a hostile armed force near its border provided Israel with a rationale, Begin 
admitted that this was a war of choice (<I>Jerusalem Post</I>, Int'l Ed. 22-28 
August, 1982). As for proportionality, it is estimated that at least 80% of the 
approximately 20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians killed in the invasion were 
civilians, many by cluster and phosphorus bombs. On this account, Israel's 
aggression failed the test of <I>jus in bello</I>, and despite propaganda about 
combatting "terrorists," of all Israel's wars, this drew the most international 
and domestic criticism. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Comment</I></B> 
<P>The 1982 war revealed the limitations to the logic of political violence, 
especially when the adversaries are not easily vanquished. As the pattern of 
strike and revenge persists, the line between oppressors and non-belligerents is 
blurred and innocent people become the victims of terrorism, whether committed 
by guerilla resistance or state military. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict turns 
from intrigue to tragedy when we consider the casualties and suffering of 
civilians from the early 1920s to the mid-1990s. Sabra and Shatilla did not mark 
the end of atrocity. Besides the civilian casualties of the Intifada (see below) 
in 1994 a Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein, murdered 29 Palestinians worshipers 
in Hebron, and beginning in 1993, Palestinian extremists launched suicide 
bombings in Israeli streets killing scores of Israeli civilians. Rather than 
frightening the opposition into submission, each round of violence only 
intensified the hatred and hardened the will for yet another cycle of vengeance. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Violence and the Media</I></B> 
<P>It has become a familiar observation that only by violence do the oppressed 
gain a hearing. Yet, as mentioned, the Western media was largely hostile to the 
Palestinian recourse to arms, especially when civilians were targeted (Picard 
1993). To anyone familiar with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 
discriminatory manner in which the "terrorist" label has been applied concealed 
the actual facts, a point underscored in Ashmore's essay below. Because states 
are viewed as legitimate international actors in a way that liberation movements 
typically are not, placing a bomb in a car or at a bus stop seemed more sinister 
than dropping it from an airplane, even though civilians were the victims in 
both cases. Then too, those sympathetic to Israel had greater access to Western 
media (Lilienthal 1982, chaps. 8-10; Chomsky 1983, chap. 5; Said and Hitchens 
1988). 
<P>The ethics of journalism are complex. Since news reports influence 
decision-makers and those who place them in power, the obligation of the news 
media is to produce accurate and relevant representations of what has happened. 
To even approximate these virtues, it must learn to avoid use of inflammatory 
language and to put events into historical context. Unfortunately, much of the 
coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has sinned on both accounts. A term 
like 'terrorism,' for example, suggests an unlawful and immoral act in a way 
that 'retaliation', 'resistance' or 'self-defense' do not. To use the former in 
labeling the actions of one party and the latter in describing the same actions 
of another is a distortion which unduly affects the audience's judgments by 
dehumanizing an entire class of people. The negative connotations of terms like 
'terrorism' and 'terrorist' obscure rather than illuminate. For purposes of 
understanding, we are better off using them clearly and consistently or avoiding 
them altogether. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>The Intifada</I></B> 
<P>The most noticeable weakness of any defense of Israel's continued occupation 
is its neglect of the interests of the resident Palestinian population. Since 
1967, the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been denied 
self-determination and the considerable civil rights enjoyed by Israeli 
citizens. Their economic development has been stifled, their resources placed 
under Israel's control and, perhaps worst of all, their land has been steadily 
confiscated. They are taxed without representation, and meager government 
expenditures have resulted in poor education and health services, far below the 
standards in Israel and neighboring Arab countries. There has been routine 
censorship and, in several cases, Palestinian villages and regions have been 
renamed. The pattern of land confiscation and road networks has unfolded a type 
of "Bantustans" arrangement with pockets of Arab population surrounded by 
Israeli-dominated territory. All of this is done under legal auspices; as Meron 
Benvenisti pointed out, Israeli rule in the territories is rule <I>by</I> law, 
not the rule <I>of</I> law (see Benvenisti 1984 and Shehadeh 1985). 
<P>Few Palestinians have opted for life elsewhere, preferring to express their 
attachment to the land in the virtue of <I>sam'ud</I> (steadfastness). As the 
pace of land confiscation and settlements increased under the Likud governments, 
their protests escalated. The Israeli military responded with force, continuing 
the pace of imprisonment and deportation while using lethal means against young 
demonstrating Palestinians. The unrest in 1981-82 in which over forty 
Palestinians were killed was a prelude to the more widespread protests of the 
<I>Intifada</I> (1987-1993) when opposition to Israeli occupation was expressed 
not only by daily demonstrations and stoning of Israeli soldiers, but also by 
commercial strikes, non-payment of taxes, and boycott of Israeli products. The 
demonstrations, the contexts in which they occurred, and the Israeli response 
are discussed at length in the essays by Robert Ashmore, James Graff and Daniel 
Statman. 
<P>The results of the Intifada were numerous. The spectacle of Palestinian 
civilians being beaten and shot at by heavily armed soldiers revealed that the 
Israeli occupation did not possess the "benign" character its supporters had 
formerly claimed. A split in the Israeli public widened. Citing security 
concerns, a sizeable number felt the IDF response was justifiable, but homegrown 
human rights groups such as B'tselem and the Israeli League for Human and Civil 
Rights joined its Palestinian counterpart Al Haq and international organizations 
such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in documenting brutality. 
The Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz referred to the sponsors of 
repression as "Judeo-Nazis" and urged Israeli soldiers to refuse service in the 
occupied territories, subsequently comparing the Israeli undercover agents who 
killed Arab teenagers with the members of the Islamic movement Hamas (<I>Chicago 
Tribune</I>, 25 January, 1993). The Intifada also changed the perceptions of 
many Israelis about Palestinians: it "has forced us to acknowledge a nation in 
revolt rather than individuals" (Hartman 1990, 238). It was a step that moved 
the parties towards negotiation, perhaps even Palestinian independence. After 
the Oslo Accords of 1993, Leibowitz said that "Every rational person can now see 
that the Palestinian state has been founded" (<I>New York Review of Books</I>, 4 
November, 1993).<SUP>29</SUP> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>Religious Claims</B> 
<P>The are few places upon which religious passion pours with such vigor as the 
<I>terra sancta</I> that includes Nazareth, Nablus, Hebron, Safad and, 
especially, Jerusalem. The territorial claims of the three Abrahamic religions 
have long been used to justify political activism and armed aggression. None has 
made a virtue of tolerance, though a demand for tolerance may be deducible from 
their fundamental moral canons. But within each tradition there are articulate 
people who emphasize certain doctrines at the expense of others, scorn rival 
interpretations, and regard alternative faiths with suspicion. They have used 
religion to justify political extremism and to cultivate zealots willing to take 
life on a massive scale--and die in the process. Their presence and numbers 
makes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a test case to determine whether 
meaningful compromise between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam is possible. 
<P>It is not surprising to find a vibrant strain of religious nationalism within 
Zionism, especially given the popular justifications for Zionism in terms of 
divine promise and the religious mission of the Jews. The Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi 
from 1921 to 1935 in Palestine, Avraham Kook, taught that redemption of the land 
is as important as redemption of the people, and he lauded the young Jews of 
Jabotinsky's Betar movement for being "willing to sacrifice their lives in the 
cause of their Holy Place" (Smith 1996, 89). "The arousal of desire in the whole 
nation to return to its Land, to the essence of its spirit and character, 
reflects the glow of repentance. It is an inner return, despite the many veils 
that obscure it" (Shimoni 1995, 148). His son, Zvi Yehuda Kook, inspired the 
messianic <I>Gush Emunim</I> (Bloc of the Faithful) movement which has been at 
the forefront of Israeli settlement in the West Bank since 1973. He declared 
that the <I>Halakha</I> forbids giving up any land that has been restored to 
Israel: "There is no Arab land here, only the inheritance of our God--and the 
more the world gets used to this thought, the better it will be for them and for 
all of us" (Friedman 1992, 19). Holding that Eretz Israel should be settled and 
defended at any cost, Kook's followers settled on the outskirts of Hebron in 
1970 and in the center of the city in 1979. As settlers protested in the summer 
of 1995 against any withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories, a group 
of rabbis (the Union of Rabbis for the Land of Israel) reiterated Kook's 
<I>Halakha</I> prohibition and urged soldiers to disobey evacuation orders, 
angering Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (<I>Chicago Tribune</I>, 13 July, 1995). 
Yigal Amir, Rabin's assassin some months later, stated that he had been directed 
by God to prevent Rabin from endangering Israel by handing over land to 
Palestinian rule: "Everything I did was for the God of Israel, the Torah of 
Israel, the people of Israel and the Land of Israel" (<I>New York Times</I>, 28 
March, 1996, A7). 
<P>No less intense is the Islamic revival among Palestinians, part of a much 
larger movement spawned, in part, by Western attempts to gain hegemony over the 
Middle East. It is an important Islamic doctrine to reserve the right of 
<I>jihad</I> for the protection of Dar-al-Islam (the Islamic community). One of 
the more established Islamic revivalist groups in the Arab world, the <I>Ikhwan 
al-Muslimin</I> (Muslim Brotherhood), considers all of Palestine to be Islamic 
territory. The Brotherhood rejects a Palestinian state in the territories if 
that entails recognizing Israel, for such recognition would legitimize the 
conquest of Muslim land (Abu-Amr 1994, 23). Beginning in the mid-1920s, `Izz 
al-Din al-Qassam (see above) advocated a combination of spiritual renewal and 
militancy to combat British rule and Zionist colonization. Convinced that jihad 
was the only means of liberation, he demanded that funds from the Muslim 
religious endowment (the <I>waqf</I>) be spent on arms rather than mosque 
repairs (Mattar 1988, 67). 
<P>Al-Qassam's legacy lives on in the Islamic movement <I>Harakat al-Muqawama 
al-Islamiyya</I> (Hamas) which emerged from disillusionment with secular 
Palestinian politics in 1987. Its spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yasin, 
currently imprisoned by Israelis, said, "<I>Jihad</I> is a duty on every Muslim 
if the Muslim's land is violated" (Abu-Amr 1994, 59). According to its 1988 
charter, Palestine is "consecrated for future Muslim generations" and no Arab 
country has the right to give it up. The movement works to "raise the banner of 
God over every inch of Palestine," and insists that "<I>jihad</I> is the path, 
and death on God's path is our most sublime aspiration." Inspired by this 
policy, Hamas has sent suicide bombers into Israeli streets to sabotage the 
peace process. The <I>Islamic Jihad</I> organization, whose slogan is "God's 
book in one hand, and the rifle in the other, holds that Israel is integral to a 
Western plan to divide the Islamic community, "to subjugate it, to enslave it, 
to paralyze its will, and to cast an eternal yoke over its neck" (Abu-Amr 1994, 
102). One of its leaders, Fathi al-Shaqaqi, assassinated in 1995, wrote that 
elimination of the "Zionist entity" is a religious duty. 
<P>Passions aside, religious <I>claims</I> bear little normative relevance to 
resolutions of intercommunal conflict. Philosophers have long realized that 
disputes can be adjudicated and settled peacefully only if there is <I>common 
ground</I> upon which the issues can be approached, and for this reason they 
have sought normative standards to which any rational being could acquiesce. But 
discourse within a single religious framework is essentially private and cannot 
provide that common ground for disputants rooted in different traditions 
(Fackenheim 1988, 13; Hartman 1990, 232). Each side can clamor all it wishes 
about the content of God's decrees, but if the opposition has a different vision 
of divine will then propositions about the rights of one and the obligations of 
another--however "true" they might be--will not generate reciprocal 
motivations.. 
<P>The relevance of religion to the conflict is not so much the bearing of dogma 
upon normative debate as the capacity of faith to motivate. Since religious 
affiliation is frequently at the center of an individual's identity, an insult 
or injury to traditions, rituals, symbols, or beliefs evokes the same sort of 
emotions that a deeply personal affront might. Reaction varies, but for those 
already prone to selective emphasis and quick to seek vengeance and restitution, 
it can result in a willingness to liquidate and be sacrificed. In 1996, after 
Israelis assassinated Yahya Ayyash, noted for his ability to design bombs 
strapped to suicide bombers, a Hamas political leader in Gaza was quoted as 
saying: "Of course there will be revenge against Israel. The principles of the 
Hamas movement command us not to lose Palestinian blood without revenge." Over 
100,000 people attended Ayyash's funeral in Gaza. In the streets they chanted 
"Death to Israel. We are all Yayha Ayyash. We are all `Izz al-Din al-Qassam" 
(<I>New York Times</I>, 15 March, 1996, A7). Israeli extremists were no less 
subtle. The gravesite of Baruch Goldstein (see above) in Kiryat Arba became a 
shrine and place of pilgrimage for his sympathizers. One is reminded of 
Voltaire's warning that those who believe absurdities will commit atrocities. 
Yet beliefs are part of the political landscape; to ignore them is folly, while 
giving them too much credence is to bolster intransigence. At best, those who 
look to religion for a peaceful solution can appeal to countervailing religious 
doctrines in working towards acceptable compromise.<SUP>30</SUP> <BR>&nbsp;

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the adjustment of Jews and Arabs, one-sided bargains are to be 
  dreaded. They spell disaster for the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>- Alfred North Whitehead, 1939</CENTER>
<P><BR>
<P>Only after a century of conflict, have Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews 
begun to negotiate. At all previous crucial junctures, in the early 1920s, in 
the late 1930s, in 1945-47, they failed to do so because the two national 
movements did not recognize each other. In 1988 the PLO unilaterally declared a 
Palestinian state, an acceptance of the UN Partition Proposal, and a readiness 
to recognize Israel. In 1991 the two sides faced each other across the table. 
Their first tangible compact was the <I>Declaration of Principles</I> signed in 
Oslo in 1993, followed by subsidiary agreements in 1994-95. Among other things, 
these provide for the redeployment of Israeli troops away from Arab population 
centers in the territories, establishment of a democratically elected 
Palestinian Authority with limited powers of self-rule, Israeli-Palestinian 
economic cooperation, and, most importantly, a five-year period of negotiations 
on the permanent status of the territories which would address Jerusalem, the 
settlements, refugees, and borders. 
<P>These agreements may seem promising, but there is no guarantee that they will 
lead to peace. Many Israelis think that they endanger Israeli security (Halkin 
1994), and since they do not guarantee self-determination or an end to Israeli 
occupation they have been received with skepticism by numerous Palestinians--an 
"offense to the Palestinian spirit" (Said 1996a, 30). It is uncertain what sort 
of "permanent status" they will produce, if any. Assuming that the status quo is 
unstable, what sort of options are available as a final resolution of the 
conflict? <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Maximalism</I></B> 
<P>Short of pacifism or skepticism about military solutions, maximalist 
proposals cannot automatically be ruled out. Israeli maximalists can argue that 
Zionist aims of providing a haven for Jews and Jewish culture cannot be achieved 
with anything less than a Jewish state throughout the mandated territory, and 
they can add that this state will survive because of the Israel's superiority of 
arms. Arab maximalism need not be Islamic-inspired; it can be argued that the 
existence of a pro-Western Jewish state in the very center of the Arab world 
constitutes a threat not only to the Palestinian community but to Arab 
independence and security throughout the Near East. This danger will remain 
regardless of local treaties. 
<P>Rejectionist arguments are appealing in their simplicity and force. They 
affirm one's initial predilections, put an end to doubt, and provide a decisive 
response to all requests for sacrifice of ideals. With their long-range optimism 
they make it easier to endure contemporary discomfort, and with their promise of 
thousand-year regimes, eternal capitals, and the fulfillment of God's will they 
can inspire even the dullest minds to embrace ideals. Yet they are singularly 
insensitive to the interests of other parties and often devoid of imagination 
about possible consequences. If anything is clear about the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict it is that ardent attachment to maximal ideals will guarantee further 
violence and bloodshed that might easily assume global proportions. How can Arab 
rejectionists eliminate Israel in the face of Israel's military superiority and 
abiding support from a powerful West? How can Israeli maximalists establish 
peaceful relations with the rest of the Middle East; is their solution not a 
recipe for either a perpetual state of war or massive genocide? <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Towards a Negotiated Solution</I></B> 
<P>"The real task of world statesmanship," said the Lebanese philosopher, 
Charles Malik, in 1948, is "to help the Jews and the Arabs not to be permanently 
alienated from one another" (Arendt 1978, 211). This task cannot be undertaken 
blindly; are there any normative principles that might guide movement towards a 
negotiated solution? Whitehead (1939) argued that any attempt to overcome the 
Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine required observance of these guidelines: 
<UL>&nbsp; 
  <LI>The reconciliation of Jewish and Arab interests "must be produced by the 
  Jews and Arabs themselves." 
  <LI>No solution should depend on the military might of a foreign power. 
  <LI>Political compromise is essential to political success. 
  <LI>Indiscriminate extension of European legal ideals to the Near East should 
  be avoided, particularly as regards personal land rights. 
  <LI>The proposed solutions must be guided by a principle of parity, one that 
  avoids humiliation for either side--"one sided-bargains are to be dreaded." 
  </LI></UL>
<P><BR>These strictures may seem "commonplace" to use Whitehead's words, yet 
they are not easily implemented, especially the demand for compromise given the 
current imbalance in comparative strength. Long-range vision is required here 
too, and probably a less rigid stance on perceived justice than one might be 
first inclined to give. Compromise merits attention because it is less evil than 
the maximalist alternatives. 
<P>What else can be said? Graff argues below that both sides must be serious in 
respecting human rights, for nothing undermines the hopes of future coexistence 
more than insults to personal and national consciousness that come from 
persecution. Yet Graff is concerned that however "commonplace" this ideal might 
be, it is often subordinated to a <I>realpolitik</I> and nationalistic hubris 
that too easily overlooks rights abuses. On the other hand, rigidity about 
"rights" may be the very obstacle to overcome, especially when the rights of 
collectives are in question. Leibowitz thought it futile to argue over which 
"people" has rights to the land; no <I>nation</I> as such has rights to land 
since "rights" are only derived from human legal institutions (1992, 225-9). The 
link of a nation or people to any particular territory exists only in the 
consciousness of its members, and such a mental entity is incapable of 
sustaining any legal claim to that territory. "This conflict has no "just" 
resolution grounded in considerations of law or the "rights" of the sides" 
(242). 
<P>While something may be said for each of these proposals, neither resolves the 
pressing issue of sovereignty. For this, we must consider yet further options. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>A Two State Solution</I></B> 
<P>ne widely-touted compromise is the two-state solution, an alternative that 
returns to the principle of partition. To some, it is "the only possible 
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict" and the only way for Israel to survive as 
a Jewish state (Harkabi 1992, 22, and see Leibowitz 1992, 226, 
242).<SUP>31</SUP> Partition is a direct application of parity that accords each 
community its separate sovereignty while insisting on mutual recognition, and in 
many ways is more reasonable now than in 1947. Demography and prevailing 
institutions have changed; Israeli Jews have established a thriving nation, 
while Palestinian Arabs have rebounded after their Catastrophe with surprising 
vigor and a growing sense of national identity. 
<P>Achieving this "peaceful divorce" (Oz 1994) between the two communities 
requires honesty about what has happened and sober-minded realizations of what 
could happen. It may well be the best solution. But there is a risk; by 
definition, the two state scenario would preserve the spirit of nationalism and 
reinforce the collective memory of past aspirations and grievances. Though it 
promises temporary breathing space, it can result in polarized "divorcees" 
competing for resources in a small region where cooperation is essential. It 
also raises the specter of future conflict driven by concerns to secure what one 
already has or ambitions to regain what one had formerly lost (Rice 1994, 
184-6), especially when one side allies with outside parties to enhance its 
position vis-a-vis the other. Although a two-state compromise would be an 
enormous stride towards permanent peace in the Middle East, it would remain 
particularly vulnerable to political developments elsewhere in the region. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Alternatives</I></B> 
<P>The binationalist alternative remains one way of satisfying the demand for 
(broad) national self-determination; it permits development of culturally-based 
institutions although it insists that sovereignty be shared.. There is little 
likelihood that binationalism will be taken seriously in the short run since it 
is opposed by both sides. But should continual conflict prove exhaustive, it may 
once again present itself as the only mechanism for overcoming nationalistic 
animosity, discrimination, and shortsightedness. 
<P>A liberal democratic state with a cosmopolitan bent would steer away from any 
settlement of the conflict in terms of national self-determination. Currently, 
it is even less popular than binationalism, but, with an eye on long-term 
stability, no major alternative should be left unexamined. As a <I>proposal</I> 
it awaits a reappraisal of the arguments for national self-determination. 
<P>Is Zionism the preferable course in the long run? Is it the best answer to 
the problems that Jews have confronted during the past century? For the vast 
majority of Jews today these questions are answered affirmatively: Zionism has 
been "one of the greater success stories among national movements in the 
twentieth century" (Reinharz and Shapira 1996, 27), and identity with Israel has 
become a unifying force for Jews around the world (Avineri 1981, 13). But it 
should be clear by now that these achievements alone are not enough to justify 
Zionism. What can? It is doubtful that Israel can provide adequate refuge in the 
event of renewed antisemitism. Less than one-third of the world's Jews currently 
live in Israel, and the prospects of mass emigration of the remainder is 
infeasible. Should antisemitism become so strident that Jews felt forced to 
gathered themselves into a single state, then, very likely, Israel would itself 
be targeted and its citizens would not be immune from the consequences of modern 
weaponry. It does not take great historical or philosophical acumen to realize 
that identification with Israel might be a new source of prejudice. Edwin 
Montagu, the only Jewish member of Lloyd-George's Cabinet, opposed the Balfour 
Declaration on precisely these grounds (Smith 1996, 54; Khalidi 1971, 145-147). 
In 1936 the Nazis exploited Zionist ideology and confirmed Montagu's fears when 
they conveniently appended to their calls for<I> Juden Raus!</I> that of <I>nach 
Palestina</I> (Brenner 1983, 81-86). 
<P>Yet, the counter-argument is not without weight. These same Nazis marched the 
eighty year old non-Zionist Simon Dubnow to his death, as they did to countless 
others. Has the modern technological world reached a stage where Jewish culture 
can only flourish when fully self-governing, where Jews cannot afford again to 
face annihilation as a minority? One must consider seriously the view of 
Fackenheim (and others) that the survival of Judaism and the Jewish people is 
dependent upon Israel's existence which, "for the profoundest religious reasons, 
is not negotiable" (Morgan 1987, 303). 
<P>Curiously, the experience of the Palestinians in their half-century diaspora 
lends some support to this separatist logic. Palestinians have been subjected to 
discrimination under Israeli rule as well in Arab countries where they have 
minority status. They have been embroiled in civil conflict in Jordan and 
Lebanon, and Palestinian civilians in Lebanon and Kuwait have been targeted 
because of PLO political and military activities. It is no accident that a type 
of "Palestinian Zionism" has emerged within their ranks (Steiner 1975, Al-Azm 
1988), and that Palestinian arguments in favor of a "return" (<I>Awdah</I>) to 
their homeland and creation of a separate state should parallel those of Herzl 
and others. How else are they to end their status as stateless outsiders at the 
mercy of foreign rule? Ironically, the very success of Zionism has spread the 
ancient cry, <I>Next year in Jerusalem!</I> more widely than it ever intended. 
Yet the phenomenon is not a new one for Palestinians, Arabs, or Muslims; the 
capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099 inspired a countercrusade that 
lasted for much of the next two centuries. 
<P>We are back where we began, with rival claims for national self-determination 
in one and the same territory. Precisely <I>this</I> tension is what the liberal 
cosmopolitan alternative aims to dissolve by breaking the link between 
sovereignty and nation while handling cultural prejudice and discrimination 
through the kind of pluralism and tolerance advocated in liberal democratic 
societies. It is sensitive to Tamir's reminder that humans exist only as members 
of particular cultures, never in the abstract, but it procedes as though the 
opposite were true in the allocation of fundamental rights and duties. Cultural 
prejudice may be impossible to eradicate, but its harmful effects can be muted 
by prohibiting official favoritism. A degree of mutual adjustment is inevitable 
for those who live among people of other cultures. Individuals "assimilate" in 
speaking a common language and tolerating different life-styles. Countries 
themselves adapt to the international community just as their citizens and 
corporations conform to global economic standards. To live in a multicultural 
world is to adjust, but by maximizing tolerance and restricting the role of 
special cultures in legislation a cosmopolitan state minimizes the demand of 
uniformity. 
<P>Most Jews are likely to continue to live outside Israel, and even if a 
Palestinian state were created, substantial numbers of Palestinians will remain 
on the outside. Adaptation is their common experience, and it should not be 
forgotten how deeply cosmopolitan the history of both peoples has been, not only 
because of dispersal but also the location of the territory to which both lay 
claim. Tolerance and intercultural exchange have established roots in the Middle 
East (Quandt 1996, 11-12), and this should be a source of optimism. 
<P>For these reasons, it is unfortunate to think that opponents of a nationalist 
creed necessarily bear animosity towards a particular cultural group (for 
example, Bauer 1990, 207, and Fackenheim 1987, 298). The judgment confuses 
criticism of a political movement with cultural prejudice, and is oblivious to 
alternatives that are equally motivated by concerns for the welfare of that 
group. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote: antisemitism is not a problem of the Jews, it is 
<I>our</I> problem (Sartre 1946, 196-97), and so is any discrimination based 
upon the accidents of birth and heritage to which we are even remotely linked. 
The twentieth century has seen what happens when nationalistic forces circle 
their wagons or launch their blitzkriegs; the result has not been pretty. In 
contrast, what I am here calling the <I>cosmopolitan alternative,</I> a state 
that is for its citizens regardless of their cultural heritage, and, therefore, 
actively opposed to both everyday bigotry and official favoritism, seems 
irresistible. Perhaps it has not reached full flower either in reality or 
imagination. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B><I>Tragic Justice</I></B> 
<P>For both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, the presence of the other is 
their most significant and inescapable challenge. Whether we agree that their 
dispute pits "right" against "right," it is no less dramatic by a clash of 
powerful <I>convictions</I>. Perhaps the quest for "absolute justice" in this 
conflict is futile and, consequently, that fixation upon the past must be 
transcended and a "tragic justice" accepted. The Israeli author Amos Oz reminds 
us that tragedies can be resolved in two ways: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>. . . there is the Shakespearean resolution and there is the 
  Chekhovian one. On the one hand, at the end of a Shakespearean tragedy, the 
  stage is strewn with dead bodies and maybe there's some justice hovering high 
  above. A Chekhov tragedy, on the other hand, ends with everybody 
  disillusioned, embittered, heartbroken, disappointed, absolutely shattered, 
  but still alive. And I want a Chekhovian and not a Shakespearean one for the 
  Israeli/Palestinian tragedy (Oz 1994, 16).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>Yet this is not the last word. One generation's heartbreak and 
disillusionment is often fuel for another's cause. What is essential is not only 
<I>that</I> both Israelis and Palestinians remain alive, but <I>how</I> they 
remain alive. The safest normative conclusion is that each must retain enough 
dignity and a capacity for interacting in a manner that is conducive to 
long-term stability throughout the region. Whether this <I>will</I> be achieved 
remains an open question as the conflict enters its second century. <BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Notes</B></CENTER><BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR><BR><BR>
<P>1. An early Zionist, Moshe Lilienblum, described nationalism as a progressive 
trend, but noted that "the drive for national self-determination, is the very 
soil in which anti-Semitism flourishes" (Avineri 1981, 69). 
<P>2. Quoted in Avineri 1981, 76. Pinsker insisted that antisemitism "as a 
psychic aberration is hereditary, and as a disease transmitted for two thousand 
years it is incurable" (77). Against this pathological hatred of Jews, "an 
inherited aberration of the human mind," polemics are useless (Vital 1975, 129). 

<P>3. Avi Erlich (1995) puts the point more strongly: "Had not Zionism been 
complete and intellectually satisfying in ancient times, and had the ancient 
Hebrews not bequeathed the idea, modern Israel would never have reemerged, no 
matter what later Zionists thought or did. In any case, Zionism is not a modern 
invention, nor is it an idea still trying to define itself, as some of Israel's 
friends and enemies imagine" (11-12). 
<P>4. The Cohen-Buber debate is excerpted in Mendes-Flohr &amp; Reinharz 1980, 
458-462). Responding to Buber, Hermann Cohen acknowledged that while Palestine 
is the Holy Land of Jewish heritage, the future and "true homeland" of Judaism 
was in the entire evolving historical world. Writing in 1945, Morris Cohen 
remained steadfast in his opposition to tribalism "whether it bears the label of 
Zionism, Aryanism, Anglo-Saxon America, or Pan-Islam" (1946, 333). 
<P>5. The term 'Arab' is primarily a linguistic, not an ethnic, designation. The 
Arab inhabitants of Palestine are partly descended from ancient Semitic peoples, 
and there was no displacement of population when conquered by the Muslims from 
the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century. 
<P>6. See Garfinkle 1991, 543 on the origins of this slogan. One of the 
persistent problems in studying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the 
abundance of myth and distortion. The infamous <I>Protocols of the Elders of 
Zion</I> comes to mind, and more recently Peters 1984 which argues that a large 
segment of Palestinian Arabs immigrated to Palestine at the same time as 
European Jews. Peters' book was immediately debunked by critics such as Yehoshua 
Porath, Edward Said, and Albert Hourani, and more recently in McCarthy 1990 and 
Finkelstein 1995. Forty years earlier, arguments similar to Peters' were 
presented in Frankenstein 1944, 128-130. 
<P>7. A similar view was favored by Albert Einstein in 1938: "I should much 
rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together 
in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. . . . I am afraid of the inner 
damage Judaism will sustain--especially from the development of a narrow 
nationalism within our own ranks (Einstein 1967, 237-8). Lilienthal (1982, 
342-3) writes of Einstein's continued opposition to Jewish nationalism even 
after WWII. 
<P>8. There is debate about what was promised to Arabs in the Hussein-McMahon 
letters. Two days after the agreement, McMahon wrote that the only areas 
excluded from Arab independence were "portions on the Northern Coast of Syria" 
(Porath 1974, 322). However, in a 1937 letter by MacMahon to the <I>Times,</I> 
he claimed that Palestine "was not or was not intended to be included in the 
territories in which the independence of the Arabs was guaranteed in my pledge" 
and that this was understood by Sheriff Hussein (Stone 1981, 146-7). This 
interpretation did not agree with Lord Curzon's view, nor with the description 
of Hussein's views by Lloyd-George who wrote that MacMahon himself was then (in 
1915) "very reluctant" to discuss boundaries despite the insistence of Hussein 
to include all the area along the eastern Mediterranean coast up to Mersina, an 
area which incorporates Palestine even though it was not mentioned by name 
(Lloyd-George 1939, 660-2). See also the discussions in Antonius 1965, chap. 9 
and Smith 1996, 43-49, 56-59. On the interpretation of the agreement as a treaty 
see Porath 1974, 46. 
<P>9. This argument was made in a report by the Executive Committee of the Arab 
Palestine Congress presented to Winston Churchill on March 28, 1921. 
<P>10. Crawford reports that self-determination applies mainly to mandated and 
trust territories (1979, 92-6), while Bassiouni and Fisher speak more broadly of 
"non-self-governing territories" (1974, 647). In application to established 
states the principle is primarily a doctrine of non-intervention (thus, 
Brilmayer 1989, 105). Buchanan (1991a) describes the principle as inherently 
vague and suggests that its main value is as a "placeholder for a range of 
possible principles specifying various forms and degrees of independence" (50). 
<P>11. The precise status of self-determination in international law is debated 
(see Emerson 1971). Several authors are explicit that self-determination is a 
recognized right of certain collectives, e.g., Suzuki 1976, 828; Ofuatey-Kodjoe 
1977, 160-7; Mallison 1986, 193; and Brilmayer 1989, 105. Paust 1980 observes 
that a case can be made for ranking self-determination as a human right, given 
Article 21 of the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" (adopted by the UN 
General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948). Friedlander (1980, 309), concludes that 
self-determination is a "principle" of international law, language that is also 
used in Crawford 1979, 84-118 and Brownlie 1990, 597. On the other hand, Emerson 
(1964) argues that there is no legal right of self-determination and Pomerance 
(1984, 337), denies that there is any "single right to self-determination in all 
cases." 
<P>12. See the informative discussion of "self-encompassing" groups in Margalit 
and Raz 1990. A "people" is more a historical category than a biological one, 
wrote Buber, whose members are bound together by self-consciousness of their 
difference from other communities and, thus, by a "unity of fate" (Buber 1963, 
217). Kedourie 1961, 31, describes <I>nationalism</I> as the doctrine of 
national self-determination. 
<P>13. It was with just this regional emphasis that the principle was utilized 
in the Peace Conference--though its application was contested precisely in the 
"unsettled" regions of Alsace-Lorraine, Upper Silesia, and Palestine due to 
<I>nationalistic</I> pressures. The regional interpretation of 
self-determination prevails in many discussions of international law (for 
instance, Crawford 1979, 84-106, and Ofuatey-Kodjoe 1977, chap. 7). 
<P>14. A fuller version of Lord Balfour's text appears in Khalidi 1971, 201-11. 
See also the discussion in Lloyd George 1939, 750. 
<P>15. Emir Feisal, son of Sheriff Hussein of Mecca and a leader of the Arab 
resistance in 1915-1918, represented the Arab kingdom of the Hejaz and appealed 
to self-determination in advocating Arab independence. In a 1919 agreement with 
Chaim Weizmann, Feisal consented to Jewish immigration into Palestine provided 
that the rights of Arab farmers be protected and "no religious test shall ever 
be required for the exercize of civil or political rights" (Antonius 1965, 438). 
Feisal added that the agreement shall be void unless the Arabs achieve 
independence as promised by the British, and subsequently argued that Arabs 
would accept only a possible Jewish province in a larger Arab state (Khoury 
1976, 12). There was no popular representation of, nor support by, Palestinian 
Arabs in the making of this agreement (Khalidi 1971, 502); to the contrary, 
there was outright opposition (Muslih 1988, chp.5). In 1925, the lawyer, Quincey 
Wright, wrote that the terms of the Mandate constituted, "a gross violation of 
the principle of self-determination proclaimed by the Allies" (Quigley 1990, 
18). 
<P>16. Porath (1974, 44) writes that Wadi al-Bustani was among the first 
Palestinian Arabs to publicize the apparent incompatibility of the Mandate with 
Article 22. In 1948 the Palestinians' Arab Higher Committee cited this article 
in justifying enterance of Arab states into Palestinian territory. For 
contrasting interpretations see Cattan 1972, 65-68 and Feinberg 1970, 41-44. 
<P>17. Ben-Gurion echoed this argument: "The conscience of humanity ought to 
weigh this: where is the balance of justice, where is the greater need, where is 
the greater peril, where is the lesser evil and where is the lesser injustice?" 
(Jewish Agency 1947, 325). In 1937 Jabotinsky made the same point in contrasting 
Arab preference with Jewish need: "it is like the claims of appetite versus the 
claims of starvation" (Hertzberg 1977, 562). 
<P>18. There is evidence that a large segment of the Eastern European Jews are 
descended from the Khazars, a central Asian people who adopted Judaism as their 
religion and fled westward to escape the Mongol invasions (see the sources cited 
in Quigley 1990, 70-71 and 259). Wexler (1996) argues that Sephardic Jews 
descend from converts to Judaism in Asia, north Africa and the Iberian 
Peninsula. Thus, any constancy of historical presence or of right to "return" 
belongs, at best, to a cultural unit, not to an ethnic community united by 
historical ancestry. 
<P>19. This point was made in the 1946 Anglo-American Committee's report (Esco 
Foundation 1947, 1225). The American philosopher William Ernest Hocking wrote 
that the Zionist territorial demands were "like asking for a microscopic section 
across one wrist" (Hocking 1945, 222). 
<P>20. This statement was made by Mr. Asaf Ali, Delegate to the United Nations 
from India in 1947 (Robinson 1947, 201). 
<P>21. The figure of 770,000 is given by Flapan (1987, 216), whereas Morris sets 
it from anywhere between 600,000 and 760,000 (1987, 298), and Khalidi at 
727,700-758,300 (1992, 582). For many years, defenders of Israel propagated the 
notion that the Arab refugees left their homes at the behest of Arab 
authorities, for example Abba Eban in a 1958 speech (Laqueur 1976, 151-164). 
This myth has since been exposed (see Childers 1961, Flapan 1987, Morris 1988, 
and Finkelstein 1995). The refugees and their descendents currently number over 
3.5 million. 
<P>22. A statement by Ben-Gurion in 1956 is revealing: "Why should the Arabs 
make peace? If I was an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. That 
is natural: we have taken their country . . . Why should they accept that?" 
(Goldman 1978, 99). 
<P>23. Emil Fackenheim writes that the Law of Return is next in importance to 
the Jewish essence of Israel as the Return itself (1988, 14). Michael Rice, on 
the other hand, finds the law to be "a nakedly racialist concept" since it 
allows any Jew, from the Hungarian Banker to the Yemenite farmer, a right to 
immigrate to and become a citizen while denying the same to Palestinian 
indigenes to whom it stands as "a most cruel affront" (Rice 1994, 41-2). See the 
brief but interesting defense of the law in Margalit and Halbertal 194, 509-510. 

<P>24. There is a debate about whether this was a just war. According to Walzer 
(1977), Israel's existence was imperiled by Egypt's military build-up making its 
anticipatory strike a "clear case of legitimate anticipation" (85). However, 
there is little to support the charge that Nasser was preparing an invasion 
which justified Israel's strike. U.S. intelligence reports to Israelis in late 
May indicated that Egypt had no plans for attack and that Israel would prevail 
in any case, an assessment subsequently confirmed by Israeli Generals Yitzhak 
Rabin, Matetiyahu Peled, and Ezer Weizmann (Lilienthal 1982, 557-558). 
<P>25. The Israeli Defense Minister at the time, Moshe Dayan, was one of the 
sponsors of Israeli settlement in the territories. He argued that "there is 
nothing sacred about the previous map from 1948," and that settlements are 
important in contributing to the creation of "a new psychological reality" 
(Lustick 1993, 357-8). 
<P>26. See Moore 1991, 729-34. Stone (1981, 167-182) has defended Israel's 
position, and so has Rostow (1990) who speaks of settlers as "volunteers" not 
"transferees" and argues that the Jewish right of settlement in the territories 
is conferred by the British Mandate. Others have criticized Israel's refusal to 
accept applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention, see, for example, Mallison 
and Mallison 1986, chapter 6; Quigly 1990, chapter 24; and Roberts 1990. See 
also the discussion in Benvenisti 1993, chapter 5. 
<P>27. Recourse to violence by Jews and Arabs produced comments from curious 
quarters, putting advocates of peace such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Buber at 
loggerheads. Writing in 1938, Gandhi emphasized that it is "wrong and inhumane 
to impose the Jews on the Arabs" and that "according to the accepted canons of 
right and wrong, nothing can be said against the Arab resistance in the face of 
overwhelming odds" (Gandhi 1938, 367-69). Responding in a 1939 letter, Buber 
wrote: "in view of the accepted canons you cast a lenient eye on those who carry 
murder into our ranks every day without even noticing who is hit" (Mendes-Flohr 
1983, 120). Gandhi did not reply, nor did he waver from his opposition to 
Zionism and to the activities of the Jewish underground in the 1940s (Jansen 
1971, 179). 
<P>28. This was how the International Commision chaired by Sean MacBride 
described Israel's responsibility for what occurred at Sabra and Shatilla 
(Mallison &amp; Mallison 1989, 400). 
<P>29. A similar view was expressed by Israel's Environmental Minister Yossi 
Sarid <I>(Chicago Tribune</I>, 23 January, 1996). However, it was not shared by 
then Prime Minister elect, Benjamin Netanyahu, who responded to Arafat's claim 
of a Palestinian state with "never" (<I>Chicago Tribune </I>6 June, 1996). 
<P>30. Many Jewish religious thinkers have carried on the tradition of Ahad 
Ha'am and Martin Buber in their sensitivity to Palestinian aspirations. Though a 
committed Zionist, Yeshayahu Leibowitz found the worship of the land of Israel 
as a form of idolatry, and argued that religion forbids regard for state and 
nation as absolute or religious values (1992, 210, 227). Israel's physical 
survival depends upon its moral survival and continued settlement will add fuel 
to the flames and render dialogue with Palestinians impossible: "Honest dialogue 
is not possible between rulers and ruled: it is possible only between equals" 
(240). David Hartman has stressed that the <I>Gush Emunim</I> is not the only 
voice drawing upon Jewish theological tradition (Hartman 1990, 241). Warning the 
Jewish extremism is a threat to Israel, he cautions that permanent control over 
Palestinians will destroy the centrality of Israel for world Jewry: "We will not 
heal our own rage and frustration through military control over the 
Palestininans but only through dealing constructively with their will for 
self-determination (Hartman 1990, 227). Among Palestinians religious thinkers, 
Sheikh Akrimeh Sabri, a member of the Supreme Muslim Council, states that no one 
of the three religions has an exclusive claim to Palestine and that, 
consequently, peace requires "mutual respect, a recognition of rights on all 
sides" (Bergen et al 1991, 121). Reverend Naim Ateek (1989) reaches into the 
Christian tradition of compassion and forgiveness in calling for mutual 
recognition of Israelis and Palestinians and for a "dynamic, healthy federation" 
of states in the Near East (172). 
<P>31. The two-state solution comes in different forms, one calling for an 
independent Palestine in the territories, the other for a federation of the 
Palestinian state with Jordan, and yet another for a Palestinian state only in 
Jordan. The latter shares most of the drawbacks of one of the maximalist 
approaches. <BR>&nbsp; </P></BODY></HTML>
