<P>
<DIV class=fr_body><I>Samuel Huntington is a mild-mannered man whose sharp 
opinions—about the collision of Islam and the West, about the role of the 
military in a liberal society, about what separates countries that work from 
countries that don't—have proved to be as prescient as they have been 
controversial. Huntington has been ridiculed and vilified, but in the decades 
ahead his view of the world will be the way it really looks</I>
<P>he most memorable review that Samuel Phillips Huntington, the Albert J. 
Weatherhead III University Professor at Harvard, ever got was a bad one. 
"Imagine," Huntington recalled recently, sitting in his home on Boston's Beacon 
Hill. "The first review of my first book, and the reviewer compares me 
unfavorably to Mussolini." He blinked and squinted shyly through his eyeglasses. 
Huntington, seventy-four, speaks in a serene and nasal voice, the East Bronx 
modified by high Boston. He described how the reviewer, Matthew Josephson, 
writing in the left-wing opinion magazine The Nation, had ridiculed the 
militarism and "brutal sophistries" of The Soldier and the State and had sneered 
that Mussolini's sentiments had been similar though his words had more panache: 
"Believe, obey, fight!" 
<P>The review was published on April 6, 1957. The Cold War was scarcely a decade 
old. <U>The Soldier and the State</U> constituted a warning: <B>America's 
liberal society, Huntington argued, required the protection of a professional 
military establishment steeped in conservative realism. In order to keep the 
peace, military leaders had to take for granted—and anticipate—the 
"irrationality, weakness, and evil in human nature."</B> Liberals were good at 
reform, not at national security. "Magnificently varied and creative when 
limited to domestic issues," Huntington wrote, "liberalism faltered when applied 
to foreign policy and defense." <B>Foreign policy, he explained, is not about 
the relationship among individuals living under the rule of law but about the 
relationship among states and other groups operating in a largely lawless realm. 
The Soldier and the State concluded with a rousing defense of West Point, which, 
Huntington wrote, "embodies the military ideal at its best ... a bit of Sparta 
in the midst of Babylon."</B>
<P>The book enraged many of Huntington's colleagues in Harvard's Department of 
Government, and the following year the department denied him tenure. With his 
close friend Zbigniew Brzezinski (whom Harvard also did not promote), Huntington 
went off to teach at Columbia University. Four years later, in 1962, Harvard 
invited both Huntington and Brzezinski back, as tenured professors. Carl J. 
Friedrich, the German-born professor who had led the opposition to Huntington, 
met with him at Columbia. Friedrich talked of his admiration for the younger 
professor, until Huntington gently reminded him of his earlier hostility. It had 
become obvious to Friedrich and others that both Huntington and Brzezinski were 
rising stars in political science, and Harvard prided itself on its domination 
of the field. Brzezinski chose to stay at Columbia, but Huntington returned to 
Harvard, where he joined another rising star in the Department of Government, 
Henry A. Kissinger. 
<P><U>The Soldier and the State</U>, now in its fourteenth printing, went on to 
become an academic classic. Telford Taylor, the chief American prosecutor at the 
Nuremberg trials, had this to say about the book when it was first published: 
"Civilian control" [of the military] has become a piece of cant that politicians 
mouth worshipfully but with little understanding. This is an area where 
iconoclasm is badly needed; Professor Huntington's store of this commodity seems 
virtually inexhaustible, and it is refreshing to follow his trail of destructive 
exposure. In recent decades scholarly commentary has focused less on one aspect 
of Huntington's book and more on another—less on the need for the military's 
sense of realism and more on the threat a military may pose to civilian 
authority. Because democracies lack the disciplined political cadres that 
dictatorships produce, they are especially prone to subtle manipulation by 
powerful militaries. The Founding Fathers, Huntington observed, while providing 
for a separation of powers within civilian government, did not foresee the 
potential encroachment on civilian government of a gigantic defense 
establishment over time. 
<P><U>The Soldier and the State</U> initiated what has become a familiar pattern 
in Huntington's long career: his work has not immediately earned brilliant 
reviews and academic awards but, rather, has garnered mixed reviews and harsh 
denunciations that ultimately yield to widespread if grudging acceptance. Even 
Huntington's enemies unwittingly define and worry about the world in ways and in 
phrases that originated with Huntington. Roger Hilsman, a specialist on 
Southeast Asia and a Huntington critic, complained in 1957 that many parts of 
The Soldier and the State "are noisy with the sounds of sawing and stretching as 
the facts are forced into the bed that has been prepared for them." Well, maybe. 
Nonetheless, The Soldier and the State put the issue of civil-military relations 
on the map. 
<P>The subject that Huntington has more recently put on the map is the "clash of 
civilizations" that is occurring as Western, Islamic, and Asian systems of 
thought and government collide. His argument is more subtle than it is usually 
given credit for, but some of the main points can be summarized. 
<P>• The fact that the world is modernizing does not mean that it is 
Westernizing. The impact of urbanization and mass communications, coupled with 
poverty and ethnic divisions, will not lead to peoples' everywhere thinking as 
we do. 
<P>• Asia, despite its ups and downs, is expanding militarily and economically. 
Islam is exploding demographically. The West may be declining in relative 
influence. 
<P>• Culture-consciousness is getting stronger, not weaker, and states or 
peoples may band together because of cul tural similarities rather than because 
of ideological ones, as in the past. 
<P>• The Western belief that parliamentary democracy and free markets are 
suitable for everyone will bring the West into conflict with 
civilizations—notably, Islam and the Chinese— that think differently. 
<P>• In a multi-polar world based loosely on civilizations rather than on 
ideologies, Americans must reaffirm their Western identity. 
<P>The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon highlight 
the tragic relevance not just of Huntington's ideas about a clash of 
civilizations but of his entire life's work. Since the 1950s he has argued that 
American society requires military and intelligence services that think in the 
most tragic, pessimistic terms. He has worried for decades about how American 
security has mostly been the result of sheer luck—the luck of geography—and may 
one day have to be truly earned. He has written that liberalism thrives only 
when security can be taken for granted—and that in the future we may not have 
that luxury. And he has warned that the West may one day have to fight for its 
most cherished values and, indeed, physical survival against extremists from 
other cultures who despise our country and who will embroil us in a 
civilizational war that is real, even if political leaders and polite punditry 
must call it by another name. While others who hold such views have found both 
happiness and favor working among like-minded thinkers in the worlds of the 
corporation, the military, and the intelligence services, Huntington has 
deliberately remained in the liberal bastion of Ivy League academia, to fight 
for his ideas on that lonely but vital front. 
<P><B>II.</B>
<P>The history of the intellectual battles surrounding American foreign policy 
since the early Cold War can be told, to an impressive degree, through 
Huntington's seventeen books and scores of articles. Kissinger and Brzezinski 
have also produced distinguished works of scholarship, but these men will be 
remembered principally for their service in government—Kissinger as National 
Security Advisor under Richard Nixon and Secretary of State under Nixon and 
Gerald Ford, and Brzezinski as National Security Advisor under Jimmy Carter. 
Huntington, though he served briefly in the Administrations of Lyndon Johnson 
and Carter, is a man of the academy to a far greater extent than his two 
friends. His ideas emerge from seminars and lectures, not from sudden 
epiphanies. If he couldn't teach, he probably couldn't write. And unlike many 
professors, he values his undergraduate students more than he does his graduate 
students. Graduate students, he told me, "are more reluctant to challenge this 
or that professor" and have often been "captured by the jargon and orthodoxy of 
the discipline." 
<P>One of his former undergraduates observes, "Other academics want to ram down 
your throat what they know, and then go on to the next victim. Huntington never 
dominates classroom discussions, and he listens intensely." Huntington disdains 
"rational-choice theory," the reigning fad in political science, which assumes 
that human behavior is predictable but which fails to take account of fear, 
envy, hatred, self-sacrifice, and other human passions that are essential to an 
understanding of politics. In an age of academic operators he is an 
old-fashioned teacher who speculates historically and philosophically on the 
human condition. His former students include Francis Fukuyama, the author of the 
famous post-Cold War anthem The End of History and the Last Man (1992), and 
Fareed Zakaria, the former managing editor of Foreign Affairs and the current 
editor of Newsweek International. 
<P>You aren't likely to see Huntington on C-SPAN, let alone on The McLaughlin 
Group. He is a worse than indifferent public speaker: hunched over, reading 
laboriously from a text. His status and reputation have come the hard way: 
through writing books that, though often publicly denounced, have had a 
pervasive influence among people who count. Although he is the classic insider 
(a former president of the American Political Science Association and a 
co-founder of Foreign Policy magazine), he writes as an outsider, someone 
willing to enrage the very experts who will ultimately judge him. "If a scholar 
has nothing new to say he should keep quiet," Huntington wrote in 1959. "The 
quest for truths is synonymous with intellectual controversy." 
<P><B>In many ways Samuel Huntington represents a dying breed: someone who 
combines liberal ideals with a deeply conservative understanding of history and 
foreign policy. Huntington is a lifelong Democrat. He was a speechwriter for 
Adlai Stevenson in the 1950s (and met his wife, Nancy, during the 1956 
campaign), a foreign-policy adviser to Hubert Humphrey in the 1960s, and one of 
the authors of Jimmy Carter's speeches on human rights in the 1970s. This same 
Huntington, though, is the founder of Harvard's John M. Olin Institute for 
Strategic Studies, a redoubt of foreign-policy realism that has been financed by 
a triad of conservative philanthropies: the John M. Olin Foundation, the Smith 
Richardson Foundation, and the Bradley Foundation.</B>
<P>When I suggested to Huntington that he is "an old-fashioned Democrat, the 
kind that no longer exists," he indulged in a rare display of emotional 
animation. He snapped in reply, "That's it—that's what I am. As Arthur 
Schlesinger would say, I am a child of Niebuhr." Reinhold Niebuhr was the 
leading Protestant theologian of twentieth-century America—a devout Christian 
who believed that men are sufficiently wicked to require tough methods for the 
preservation of order. Huntington, an Episcopalian, was attracted to what he 
describes as Niebuhr's "compelling combination of morality and practical 
realism." Though an ardent Cold Warrior, Niebuhr never succumbed to moral 
triumphalism, believing that history was more profoundly characterized by irony 
than by progress. Even if the United States were to win the Cold War, Niebuhr 
wrote in 1952, this outcome might only cause the nation to overextend itself, 
dissipating its power in an excess of righteousness. Niebuhr's tragic 
sensibility constitutes a thread connecting all of Huntington's major works. It 
is the key to Huntington's definition of conservatism. 
<P>In the June, 1957, edition of The American Political Science Review, 
Huntington published a monograph titled "Conservatism as an Ideology." 
Liberalism, he wrote, is an ideology of individualism, free markets, liberty, 
and the rule of law. "Classic conservatism," in contrast, has no particular 
vision: it is a rationale, "high and necessary," for ensuring the survival of 
liberal institutions. Conservatism, Huntington observed, is the "rational 
defense of being against mind, of order against chaos." In England, he 
explained, Edmund Burke mounted a conservative defense of a "commercial society 
and a moderate, liberal constitution." Real conservatism is about conserving 
what is, rather than crusading abroad for what is not or proposing radical 
changes at home. In the United States, Federalists like John Adams and Alexander 
Hamilton expounded conservative principles to defend a liberal constitution. 
"The American political genius," Huntington wrote, "is manifest not in our ideas 
but in our institutions." And in his view, "The greatest need is not so much the 
creation of more liberal institutions as the successful defense of those which 
already exist." 
<P><B>III.</B>
<P>Samuel Huntington was born in 1927 in New York City and grew up in 
middle-class housing projects in the Astoria section of Queens and in the East 
Bronx. He was the only child of Richard Thomas Huntington, a publisher of hotel 
trade journals, and Dorothy Sanborn Phillips, a short-story writer, and he was 
the grandson of John Sanborn Phillips, the co-editor of the muckraking magazine 
McClure's. Huntington was a prodigy. He went to Yale from Peter Stuyvesant High 
School at age sixteen and graduated with "exceptional distinction" after two and 
a half years. He served in the U.S. Army and then earned a master's degree in 
political science from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from Harvard. He 
believes that the strain of writing his Ph.D. dissertation over the course of 
four grueling months in 1950 is what precipitated the diabetes he suffers, which 
has necessitated six daily blood tests and three daily insulin injections ever 
since. (He interrupted our conversation to test his blood-sugar level and to jab 
himself with a syringe. After looking at the blood-sugar number, he said, "Good, 
I can have a salad and a glass of wine for lunch.") His doctoral dissertation, 
"Clientalism," carried on in the muckraking tradition of his grandfather. It 
described how federal agencies, notably the Interstate Commerce Commission, get 
taken over by the very industries that they are supposed to regulate. "We were 
all liberals, and Franklin Roosevelt was God," Huntington told me. "I couldn't 
imagine that anyone thought differently." Psychologically, Huntington's world at 
this time bore the imprint of the New Deal. Still, Harvard manifested an 
occasional irregularity. <B>"There was one student who vigorously opposed 
collective bargaining, the minimum wage—all the conventional wisdom, in fact. It 
was quite a shock for all of us." This student, William Rehnquist, eventually 
left for Stanford Law School.</B>
<P>Two towering intellectual figures then ruled Harvard's Department of 
Government: Carl Friedrich and William Yandell Elliott. Friedrich, the more 
liberal of the two, had helped to write the constitution for the Federal 
Republic of Germany (that is, the old West Germany). Huntington gravitated 
toward Elliott, an Oxford-educated southerner and a conservative philosopher 
with much experience in Washington. Elliott believed in a vigorous stance 
against the Soviet Union and loathed moral relativism. "Elliott would travel to 
Cambridge once a week from Washington to meet with his graduate students," 
Huntington recalled. Among those profoundly influenced by Elliott was 
Huntington's contemporary Henry Kissinger. "We would wait in [Elliott's] outer 
office as the minutes went by, incensed that he was running late because of the 
time he took mentoring this one student, whom Elliott had identified as showing 
particular promise. Then the door would open and this chubby student would walk 
out." Kissinger dedicated his first book to Elliott: <U>A World Restored</U> 
(1957), which described Metternich's creation of a stable, post-Napoleonic world 
order. "Elliott was no great theorist," Kissinger told me, "but a good teacher 
is someone who sees talents in you that you didn't know you had. After I had 
written a paper on Kant, Elliott told me, 'You have a fine mind, but now you 
have to read novelists, like Dostoyevsky.' And so I read Dostoyevsky. This is 
how he helped his students grow." 
<P>Sweeping and icy statements dominate Huntington's books. These blunt 
judgments contrast sharply with Huntington's unimposing physical presence and 
unaffected demeanor. He looks like a character from a John Cheever story, 
someone you might forget that you had ever met. He blinks. He plays nervously 
with keys. He is balding, and stares intently at his palms as he talks. The 
fragile exterior conceals a flinty core. "Sam is very shy," Brzezinski says. 
"He's not one of those guys who can shoot the breeze at a bar. But get him into 
a debate and he is confident and tenacious." A former student says, "Sam is a 
geek with a backbone of steel." Another of his students demurs: "Sam isn't a 
geek. He's a quintessential Victorian man of honor—very quiet and contained, yet 
extraordinarily tough when the occasion demands." 
<P>In the early 1980s, walking home one night from a Cambridge dinner party with 
his wife and Francis Keppel, the retired dean of the Harvard Graduate School of 
Education, Huntington was approached by three young men who demanded his money. 
"What?" Huntington asked. "We're not fucking around, we want your cash," one of 
the young men said before attacking him. Huntington repulsed him and wrestled 
him to the ground, calling for help. Then he took on a second, who was on top of 
Keppel. Ultimately the three men ran off. Huntington did not volunteer this 
story: I learned about it from one of his former students, and then had to get 
the details from Nancy. When I asked Huntington himself about it, he said, "A 
week before there had been an article in one of the newsmagazines recommending 
that you shouldn't fight with a mugger. But my immediate impulse was to fight 
back." 
<P><B>IV.</B>
<P>From the outset Huntington's thinking has been focused on the big issues of 
the modern world; he was always interested in applying intellectual rigor to 
real-life concerns. Henry Kissinger's first book was largely inspired by 
early-nineteenth-century European history. Huntington's first book was inspired 
by what was going on in America when he was a graduate student. As Robert D. 
Putnam, of Harvard, has written in an essay on Huntington, <U>The Soldier and 
the State</U> was inspired by President Harry Truman's firing of General Douglas 
MacArthur for insubordination, in 1951. MacArthur's political generalship had 
disturbed Huntington, in part because it undermined the idea of a professional 
military. The military—and the U.S. Senate, another conservative 
institution—would later prove to be the most effective bulwarks against Senator 
Joseph McCarthy's assault on America's liberal values. <U>The Soldier and the 
State</U> was no apologia for militarism, as some simplistic critiques have 
claimed, but, rather, a penetrating analysis of the relationship between the 
military and society. 
<P>The most telling passage in The Soldier and the State is in the preface, 
where the twenty-nine-year-old Huntington came to a conclusion that formed the 
template of an entire career. On the one hand, he conceded that "actual 
personalities, institutions, and beliefs do not fit into neat logical 
categories." But on the other, he argued passionately that "neat logical 
categories are necessary if man is to think profitably about the real world in 
which he lives and to derive from it lessons for broader application and use." A 
scholar, in order to say anything significant, is "forced to generalize." The 
true measure of a theory is not that it accounts for all the relevant facts but 
that it accounts for those facts "better than any other theory." Without 
abstraction and simplification there can be no understanding, Huntington 
maintained. Those who concentrate on the imperfections of a theory, without 
coming up with a better alternative, are helping no one. Thus begins a book of 
relentless, empirical generalizations. 
<P>From the end of the War of 1812 through the attack on Pearl Harbor, 
Huntington wrote, Americans had little reason to worry about foreign threats. 
National security was taken for granted—an inheritance of geographical 
circumstance, rather than a creation of wise policy. With neither security nor 
economic expansion on a resource-rich continent in doubt, the liberal ideology 
that Americans acquired from their English forebears could be firmly established 
without contradiction. In the absence of any threat to the nation's liberal 
institutions, there was little need to defend them, and thus little need for 
real conservatism. Conservatives like Hamilton and Adams could thrive only 
because during the first years of the Republic it was surrounded by French, 
English, and Spanish territory, and was hampered by the British fleet. But for 
many decades thereafter no foreign threats existed on any significant scale, and 
the "low view of man" cultivated by conservatives entered a state of dormancy. 
Indeed, when President Woodrow Wilson read in the Baltimore Sun in 1915 that his 
general staff was preparing pragmatically for the possibility of war with 
Germany, he was "trembling and white with passion," and insisted to his aides 
that if the story was true, the staff officers should be fired. <B>"Liberalism," 
Huntington observed, "does not understand and is hostile to military 
institutions and the military function."</B>
<P>Of course, the early twentieth century did witness a brief rebirth of 
Hamiltonian realism and interventionism, identified with the aggressive foreign 
policy of President Theodore Roosevelt. But the aversion to power politics was 
so deeply ingrained in the American psyche that Wilson's foreign-policy failures 
in the aftermath of World War I led to "abandoning intervention altogether and 
returning to liberal isolationism." With no one left to carry the torch of 
Hamilton, whose realist philosophy could reconcile the military to the rest of 
society, the American military in the interwar period withdrew into itself. It 
did so just as it was undergoing intensive professionalization and 
specialization, near the climax of the Industrial Revolution. 
<P>Huntington reminded us that the modern officer is a professional, whose job 
is the management of violence and whose client is the state. Although war is as 
old as humankind, a professional military essentially began with the Napoleonic 
Wars. The Founding Fathers put their uniforms on and off as the occasion 
demanded, and saw little distinction between soldiers and civilians. The 
Constitution does not provide for "objective civilian control" of government, 
which came about, again, because of the accident of geography: without a foreign 
threat, our standing army long remained small and politically weak, and could be 
reduced in size after every war. But the advance of technology that culminated 
in World War II, with Pearl Harbor and the atomic bomb, meant that geography was 
no longer a barrier. Security might at times have to take precedence over 
liberal values. 
<P>The liberal values that a democracy holds dear, Huntington explained, are 
also the values that can undermine a professional officer corps. "The heart of 
liberalism is individualism," he wrote. "It emphasizes the reason and moral 
dignity of the individual." But the military man, because of the nature of his 
job, has to assume irrationality and the permanence of violent conflict in human 
relations. "The liberal glorifies self-expression" because the liberal takes 
national security for granted; the military man glorifies "obedience" because he 
does not take that security for granted. A democracy may fight better than a 
dictatorship, because its middle-level officers are more inclined to make risky 
decisions; that is one reason for our success on the beaches of Normandy, and 
for the success of the Israelis over Arab armies. Nevertheless, a truly liberal 
military would lack the lethal effectiveness required to defend a liberal 
society threatened by technologically empowered illiberal adversaries. 
<P>Existing institutions; and its goals are limited. It eschews grand designs, 
because it has no universal value system that it seeks to impose on others. The 
conservative mind, like the military one, believes that human beings learn only 
from human experience, which leads to an accent on the study of history. History 
forms the centerpiece of war-college curricula. 
<P>But don't assume, Huntington said, that the conservatism of the military is 
inherently reactionary, in an ideological sense. In nineteenth-century Europe 
the professionalization of militaries allowed men of all backgrounds to advance 
in the ranks; militaries challenged the aristocratic basis of society. In 
egalitarian America the dynamic between the military and society was bound to be 
different. The United States was already democratic, and under no threat. The 
military was more isolated, and over time it developed an ethos that was 
markedly more aristocratic than that of society. The more a liberal society 
isolates and reproaches the military, Huntington implied, the more conservative 
the military may become in response. 
<P>Now here is where the young Huntington really got interesting. Our very 
greatness, he said, is what makes it difficult for the American liberal mind to 
deal with the outside world. <B>"American nationalism," he wrote, "has been an 
idealistic nationalism, justified, not by the assertion of the superiority of 
the American people over other peoples, but by the assertion of the superiority 
of American ideals over other ideals."</B> French foreign policy can be whatever 
the French decide it is, provided it is in their momentary self-interest. But 
American foreign policy is judged by the criteria of universal principles. 
According to Huntington, this leads to a pacifist strain in American liberalism 
when it comes to defending our hard-core national interests, and an aggressive 
strain when it comes to defending human rights. Although the professional 
soldier accepts the reality of never-ending and limited conflict, "the liberal 
tendency," Huntington explained, is "to absolutize and dichotomize war and 
peace." Liberals will most readily support a war if they can turn it into a 
crusade for advancing humanistic ideals. That is why, he wrote, liberals seek to 
reduce the defense budget even as they periodically demand an adventurous 
foreign policy. It came as no surprise to readers of <U>The Soldier and the 
State</U> that the same intellectuals and opinion-makers who consistently 
underappreciated NATO in the 1970s and 1980s, when the outcome of the Cold War 
remained in doubt, demanded aggressive NATO involvement in the 1990s, in Bosnia 
and Kosovo, when the stakes for our national security were much lower, but the 
assault on liberal principles was vivid and clear-cut. 
<P>The only way to preserve a liberal society, Huntington wrote, is to define 
the limits of military control. And the only way to do that across the uncertain 
decades and centuries ahead is to keep the military and the advice it offers 
strictly professional. Therefore, a soldier should recommend battle only in the 
case of national interest. If he is to fight for other reasons, even 
humanitarian ones, the pressure to do so must come from his civilian superiors. 
<P><B>In 1993 General Colin Powell, then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, expressed opposition to U.S. military involvement in Bosnia and was 
branded a "political general" by some. But a reader of Huntington might think a 
little differently about Powell. If his client's territory is under no direct 
danger, the professional officer cannot recommend "the involvement of the state 
in war except when victory is certain,"</B> as Huntington wrote. Powell's 
opposition to war in a case where the impact on our national interest was 
inconclusive and where victory appeared unsure was not so much a "Powell 
doctrine" as it was the age-old dictum of the military professional, who seeks 
to avoid becoming "political" and refuses to promote moral crusades, however 
justified they may be. (Of course, the military's ability to intimidate our 
civilian leadership into inaction in Bosnia points up Huntington's other 
realization: about how democracies are encroached on by overbearing defense 
establishments.) 
<P>The first decade of the Cold War indicated to Huntington that although 
tension would persist between a liberal society and a vast new defense 
establishment, the two would find ways to coexist. He saw Truman as a harbinger 
of this emerging order: liberal at home, but profoundly conservative in foreign 
affairs. It was the civilian business community, Huntington observed, that was 
now providing a bridge between the military and the rest of society. For many of 
us, big business embodies conservative pragmatism and what is known as the 
military-industrial complex. But Huntington exposed this image as a Cold War 
artifact. "Business pacifism" is how he describes the capitalist's view of the 
world through most of our earlier history. Religious moralism and economic 
liberalism combined to make most American businessmen see international trade 
and multilateral treaties as more important than power politics. The end of the 
Cold War has revived that view of the world. Liberals and neoconservatives who 
now worry about the American business community's growing economic involvement 
with an authoritarian China are revisiting an old Huntington argument. 
<P><B>V.</B>
<P>By the mid-1960s Samuel Huntington had settled into the life of a Harvard 
professor, quietly raising a family in the Boston area. This life was briefly 
interrupted by an assignment for the Johnson Administration in 1967: as a State 
Department consultant, he prepared a 100-page report on the Vietnam War that was 
later declassified and used as the basis for an article in the July, 1968, issue 
of Foreign Affairs. The article caused a tremendous furor. It embraced the 
Administration's objective of defeating the North Vietnamese, but explained why 
the Administration's methods for achieving that objective were all wrong. 
<P><B>Huntington rejected the significance of the Johnson Administration's claim 
that the proportion of the South Vietnamese population under government control 
(rather than under Viet Cong control) had risen from 40 percent to 60 percent. 
"This change," he wrote, is "the result of the movement of the population into 
the cities rather than the extension of the Government's control into the 
countryside"—where the Viet Cong were as strong as ever. But although the 
Johnson Administration was guilty of "unwarranted optimism," the critics of the 
Administration, he asserted, were guilty of "misplaced moralism." Huntington 
pointed out that the question Whom does the majority of the population really 
support? was relevant only in a stable constitutional democracy like America's, 
not amid the mounting chaos and violence of a country like Vietnam. Further, 
winning popular support by promoting rural development would achieve nothing; it 
wasn't rural poverty that drove people into the arms of the Viet Cong but, 
rather, "the absence of an effective structure of authority."</B> And where such 
a strong authority existed, Huntington wrote, "even though it be quite 
hierarchical and undemocratic, the Viet Cong make little progress." The one 
third of the rural population that had withstood Viet Cong infiltration had done 
so because of tough ethnic and religious communal organizations that were often 
as inimical to Western values as the Viet Cong were. "Even back then we were 
nation-building," Huntington told me, with disapproval. "We rejected religious 
and ethnic loyalties as counterweights to the Viet Cong because we wanted a 
modern, democratic nation-state with a national army. One problem with Vietnam 
was our idealism." 
<P>uch idealism, he says, now characterizes other American involvements 
overseas: "The media appeal to our national egotism, which assumes our values 
and political structures are those the rest of the world wants; and if it 
doesn't want them, it ought to." <B>tington believes that we should proclaim our 
values abroad in ways that allow us to take advantage of our adversaries but do 
not force us to remake societies from within.</B>s in the late 1970s he helped 
Zbigniew Brzezinski and Jimmy Carter to implement a human-rights policy designed 
to embarrass the Soviet Union, but he has remained skeptical about putting 
troops on the ground to build Western-style democracy in places with no 
tradition of it. 
<P>tington's analysis of Vietnam derived from his newly emerging world view. In 
the 1950s and 1960s the big issue in social science was political modernization. 
The conventional academic wisdom was that new countries in Africa and elsewhere 
would develop democracies and legal systems similar to ours. Huntington would 
have none of this. His insight about Vietnam—that the kind of authority that 
worked there was not at all like ours—fit into the larger theme elaborated in 
his book <U>itical Order in Changing Societies</U>68). Political Order is a 
study of how states are formed, and perhaps Huntington's most important book. In 
the fourteenth century the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun described in his 
Muqaddimah how desert nomads, in aspiring to the comforts of a sedentary life, 
created the dynamic for urbanization that was then captured by powerful 
dynasties. Huntington continued the story. He described how development leads to 
new patterns of instability, including upheavals and revolutions, which result 
in the building of more-complex institutions. Political Order in Changing 
Societies, though written three and a half decades ago, is still the clearest 
road map to what developing countries face in their attempts to establish stable 
and responsive governments in an era of globalization. The book opens with a 
bold assertion. <B>most important political distinction among countries concerns 
not their form of government but their degree of government. The differences 
between democracy and dictatorship are less than the differences between those 
countries whose politics embodies consensus, community, legitimacy, 
organization, effectiveness, [and] stability, and those countries whose politics 
is deficient in these qualities.</B>
<P>statement that the distinction between democracies and dictatorships is less 
important than it seems will come as no surprise to those who have experienced 
the social chaos in, say, Nigeria and Ghana, despite the elections that those 
countries hold, and have also experienced the relative openness and civil 
stability of more-autocratic societies such as Jordan, Tunisia, and Singapore. 
More than other academics, Huntington pays attention to ground-level realities. 
Throughout his career he has displayed an academically atypical fondness for 
quoting on-the-scene observers (as well as academics) in his footnotes. "There 
are no academic sources for recent events," he told me. "There is only academic 
opinion." "Americans believe in the unity of goodness," Huntington wrote. They 
"assume that all good things go together"—social progress, economic growth, 
political stability, and so on. But consider India, he suggested. India had one 
tenth the per capita income of Argentina and Venezuela in the 1950s, yet it was 
politically more stable. Why? Part of the answer is something "bad": India's 
illiteracy. Illiteracy in India fostered democratic stability, because rural 
illiterates make fewer demands on government than a newly literate urban 
proletariat. Illiterates or semi-literates merely vote; literate people 
organize, and challenge the existing system. India, Huntington contended, was 
stable and democratic for decades despite its poverty because of an unusual 
combination of factors: a poorly educated electorate and a highly educated elite 
large enough to administer modern governmental institutions. Now that a newly 
literate lower-middle class is emerging in India, the nation's politics have 
become far nastier. 
<P>The problem for American thinking, Huntington continued, <B>that our history 
has taught us how to limit government, not how to build it from scratch.<B>As 
our security, a product of geography, was largely unearned, so were our 
governing institutions and practices, an inheritance from seventeenth-century 
England. The Constitution is about controlling authority; throughout Asia, 
Africa, Latin America, and the formerly communist world the difficulty is to 
establish authority. "The problem," Huntington wrote, "is not to hold elections 
but to create organizations." </B></B>
<P>Poltically advanced states loyalty is to institutions, not to groups. States 
like ours are the result of a long process of urbanization and enlightenment, 
but this process can be destabilizing in its own right. "The faster the 
enlightenment of the population, the more frequent the overthrow of the 
government," he observed. The French and Mexican Revolutions were preceded not 
by poverty but by sustained social and economic development. The economic growth 
that the global elite now champions around the world will lead to instability 
and upheaval before it leads to politically advanced societies. 
<P>Xprts frequently wring their hands about corruption. Political Order 
demonstrates that the very modernization they champion causes corruption in the 
first place. The eighteenth century saw unprecedented levels of corruption in 
England, owing to the onset of the Industrial Revolution; the same can be said 
of nineteenth-century America. But corruption at this stage of development can 
be useful, Huntington wrote, and should not be high-mindedly disparaged. 
Corruption provides the means for assimilating new groups into the system. The 
selling of parliamentary seats, for example, is typical of an emerging 
democracy, and preferable to armed attacks against Parliament itself. 
Corruption, Huntington pointed out, is a less extreme form of alienation than 
violence: "He who corrupts a system's police officers is more likely to identify 
with the system than he who storms the system's police stations." In 
late-nineteenth-century America legislatures and city councils were corrupted by 
utilities, railway companies, and new industrial corporations—the same forces 
that were spurring economic growth and helping to make the United States a world 
power. In India many economic activities would be paralyzed without baksheesh. 
Corruption in moderate doses can overcome unresponsive bureaucracy and be an 
instrument of progress. 
<P>the same time, Huntington explained, the hurly-burly of modernization and 
corruption invites a puritanical reaction. The seamy trade-offs necessary for 
growth and stability are denounced by zealots, delegitimizing the political 
process. This happened in Iran a decade after Political Order was published. 
<P>United States, Huntington said, has trouble understanding revolutionary 
ferment in the rest of the world because it never experienced a real revolution. 
Instead it went through a war of independence—and not even one "of natives 
against alien conquerors," like that of the Algerians against the French, but 
one of settlers against the home country. Real revolutions are 
different—bad—Huntington made clear. Fortunately, they are rare. Even as the 
proletariat in Third World slums continues to radicalize, the middle classes 
become increasingly conservative and more willing to fight for the existing 
order. Writing in the late 1960s, Huntington was describing the world of the 
early twenty-first century. When a revolution does occur, continued economic 
deprivation "may well be essential to its success." The idea that food shortages 
and other hardships caused by economic sanctions will lead to the overthrow of a 
revolutionary regime like Saddam Hussein's or Fidel Castro's is nonsense, in 
Huntington's view. Material sacrifices, although intolerable in a normal 
situation, are proof of ideological commitment in a revolutionary one: 
<B>Revolutionary Gvmtsndermined by affluence; but they are never overthrown by 
poverty."</B>Spanish and Canadian developers now uilding hotels in Havana may 
know better than the American government does how to undermine a revolutionary 
regime. 
<P>tington portrayed the problem of revolutions, monarchies, praetorian regimes, 
and feudal states by drawing on a wealth of examples from all over the world. He 
offered a panorama of the messiness, intractability, and complexity of our 
times, even as he efficiently distilled and summarized. In one sentence (in 
itical Order) he laid out the different roles played by militaries throughout 
the twentieth century: "In the world of oligarchy, the soldier is a radical; in 
the middle class world, he is a participant and arbiter; as the mass society 
looms ... he becomes the conservative guardian of the existing order." A better 
description of the changing role of the Turkish army over the decades, or of the 
evolving status of the Egyptian army, has never been written. Indeed, the more 
backward the society, the more progressive the role of the military may be—and 
the more cautious the West should be about wanting to replace it with civilian 
politicians. 
<P>rica's confidence in "democratic" reform for its own sake is misplaced. 
"Reform can be a catalyst of revolution," Huntington wrote, "rather than a 
substitute for it ... great revolutions have followed periods of reform, not 
periods of stagnation and repression." In any case, reform in underdeveloped 
societies is effected not by transparency and greater public participation but, 
as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk showed in Turkey, by "celerity and surprise—those two 
ancient principles of war." If a reform program is revealed gradually, a free 
press will dissect it and create opposition to it. Because one sector of society 
will support one reform but not another, a reformer must work by stealth, 
isolating one set of issues from the next, and often relying not on the media 
but on the gaps in communication that exist within a society. 
<P>mass communications work their own magic, as Huntington admitted in a long 
coda to Political Order that he published later,<U>e Third Wave </U>. This book, 
subtitled "Democratization in the Late 20th Century," has been called 
"universalist and militantly pro-democracy" by the French scholar and otherwise 
harsh Huntington critic Pierre Hassner. Huntington has always been a liberal, 
but one who refuses to retreat into easy platitudes for the sake of a carefully 
constructed reputation. His books illustrate what academic tenure is supposed to 
be about but often isn't: the freedom, provided by occupational security, to 
express views that are (at least in the academy) unpopular, unconventional, 
unwelcome, and bold. 
<P>VI. 
<P>1960s presented Huntington with some trying moments. He was followed through 
Harvard Yard by chanting demonstrators, who had read in the Harvard Crimson 
about his association with the Johnson Administration. The Center for 
International Affairs, where Huntington worked, was occupied and then 
fire-bombed. Huntington's young son awoke one morning to find the words "War 
Criminal Lives Here" painted on the front door. 
<P>tington was not deterred from further government service. As noted, he joined 
the Carter Administration, and helped President Carter to craft a foreign policy 
that was an expression of our human-rights ideals. This was not a matter of soft 
sanctimony but a hard-edged tool that posed severe political problems for the 
Soviets. As the coordinator for security planning, a job created for him by 
Brzezinski, Carter's National Security Advisor, Huntington also wrote 
"Presidential Directive 18," a comprehensive overview of U.S.-Soviet relations 
that helped to galvanize the National Security Council against accommodation 
with Moscow. At a time when pessimism was widespread, after Soviet advances in 
Angola and Ethiopia, and with leftist Third World majorities dominating the 
United Nations, Huntington created a battalion of task forces to evaluate where 
the Soviets and the Americans stood with regard to weapons production, 
intelligence gathering, economics, diplomacy, and other areas. He and his team 
concluded that the Soviet advantage was temporary, and that the West would 
eventually move out ahead. They strongly recommended that the United States 
commence a military buildup and create a Persian Gulf rapid-reaction force. The 
last two years of Carter's presidency and the eight years of Ronald Reagan's 
presidency would see those recommendations become reality. 
<P>y in 1981 did Huntington get around to publishing a book about the 1960s, 
American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony. Most generations in history have 
been organizational ones, preferring to motor along in their daily grooves, 
directed by others. Why, Huntington asked, are some generations different? His 
answer was that the 1960s constituted a "creedal passion period," something that 
erupts every few generations in Anglo-Saxon culture, and has its roots in 
England's seventeenth-century Civil War; the New World experienced something 
similar in the Protestant Great Awakening of the 1740s. 
<P><B>all the drugs and sex, Huntington viewed the 1960s demonstrators as 
essentially Puritans, upset that our institutions were not living up to our 
ideals. It is the very promise of those ideals—which cannot possibly be 
fulfilled in any age—that accounts for the "central agony" in American 
politics.</B>
<P>e America in the 1950s and 1960s, early-seventeenth-century England was in 
the throes of rapid economic development and social change—even as the peers and 
the gentry became frustrated with an increasingly impersonal government. The 
result was a Puritan uprising against the Crown in the hopes of erecting a 
morality-based society. It culminated in the conservative Restoration. The Great 
Awakening, a century later, was another Puritan revival, as American 
evangelicals, imbued with pioneer optimism and impatient with the status quo, 
fanned out over New England in a contest for souls. 
<P>Great Awakening, Huntington wrote, "bequeathed to the American people the 
belief that they were engaged in a righteous effort to insure the triumph of 
good over evil"—which resulted in what Huntington and others called the American 
Creed. The creed became the touchstone of our national identity, because for the 
first few decades of our country's history there was little else to separate us 
from our English cousins. Allegiance to the creed would allow one generation of 
immigrants after another to Americanize rapidly while retaining elements of 
their ethnic cultures. Unlike other national creeds, ours is universalistic, 
democratic, egalitarian, and individualistic. The Jacksonian age of the 1820s 
and 1830s was a creedal-passion period, and so were the Populist-Progressive 
years at the turn of the twentieth century. 
<P>position to power, and suspicion of government as the most dangerous 
embodiment of power, are the central themes of American political thought," 
Huntington wrote. And it is true: just look at our extremist groups. Whereas 
both the right and the left in Europe have traditionally favored a strong state, 
both right-wing and left-wing radicals in America have always demanded more 
"popular control." Indeed, the very institutions required to deal with foreign 
enemies were excoriated by the 1960s militants. "The arrogance of power was 
superseded by the arrogance of morality," Huntington wrote. The Old Left was 
identified with the working class and the labor unions, but the New Left 
"eschewed the working class and stressed moralism rather than ideology." The New 
Left, explained a leader of the Students for a Democratic Society whom 
Huntington quoted, "begins from moral values, which are held as 
absolute"—Puritanism in its most unadulterated form. 
<P>aftermath of creedal passion is cynical indifference followed by the return 
of conservatism; creedal passion holds government and society to standards that 
they simply cannot meet. Nevertheless, Huntington believes, creedal passion is 
at the core of America's greatness. By holding officials and institutions to 
impossible standards in a way no other country does, the United States has 
periodically reinvented itself through evolution rather than revolution. What 
will the next creedal-passion period be about? "Power is now seen as corporate. 
So the next outburst of creedal passion may be against hegemonic corporate 
capitalism." 
<P>VII. 
<P>early 1990s were a time of optimism and even triumphalism in the West. The 
Cold War had just been won. Neoconservatives assumed that democratic elections 
and the unleashing of market forces would improve life everywhere. Liberals 
assumed that power politics and huge defense budgets were relics of the past. 
News stories heralded the growing clout and effectiveness of the United Nations. 
A new transnational elite was emerging, composed of prominent academics and 
business leaders who believed that the world was on the verge of creating a 
truly global culture. 
<P>n Samuel Huntington published an article titled "The Clash of Civilizations?" 
The article, which appeared in Foreign Affairs in 1993, was partly conceived in 
one of Huntington's seminars, where the paradigm of a world unified by 
globalization was challenged in classroom discussion. There was little evidence 
that any sort of universal civilization existed outside the confines of a small, 
highly educated elite. The fact that the United States and China, for example, 
could communicate with each other more easily did not mean that they were any 
more likely to agree with each other. Indeed, the global media spotlight in 
places like the West Bank and Northern Ireland often magnified 
misunderstandings. Considering the contrarian nature of Huntington's previous 
ideas—corruption can sometimes be good; the difference between democracy and 
dictatorship is less than we think; the sixties radicals were puritanical—"The 
Clash of Civilizations?" should not have caused much of a stir. In light of 
subsequent events Huntington's thesis may even seem unremarkable—the ironic fate 
of true prescience. 
<P>is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world 
will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions 
among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation 
states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal 
conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different 
civilizations ... Conflict between civilizations will be the latest phase of the 
evolution of conflict in the modern world. 
<P>these words did indeed stir passions. An angry response was instantaneous. So 
was the sheer interest in what Huntington had to say. "The Clash of 
Civilizations?" was translated into twenty-six languages; scholarly conferences 
were organized around the world to debate the article. "Unlike Sam's previous 
works," Brzezinski told me, "the title of this one said it all. So people 
reacted to a captivating title without reading the interesting nuances in the 
text itself." Huntington's statement that beyond the universities, luxury 
hotels, and spanking new suburbs the world was being coarsened with new social 
and cultural tensions—feeding new political conflicts—was immensely threatening 
to an elite whose cosmopolitan lifestyle was insulated from the realities that 
Huntington was describing. For elites in the Third World especially, to 
acknowledge the truth of Huntington's points would have been to acknowledge the 
fragility of their own status in their respective societies. 
<P>se who thought that the end of the Cold War meant a less dangerous world, 
this sort of thinking was an insult. Many of the criticisms of "The Clash" 
amounted to mere value judgments—"morally dangerous," "a self-fulfilling 
prophecy"—rather than substantive disputation. 
<P>there was an attack on grounds of substance, too. The central charge: 
Huntington was being simplistic. The Islamic world, for example, wasn't uniform. 
Individual Muslim states often fought or denounced one another. Huntington 
answered his critics in a second Foreign Affairs article, later in 1993, 
maintaining that simplicity was the very point: "When people think seriously, 
they think abstractly; they conjure up simplified pictures of reality called 
concepts, theories, models, paradigms. Without such intellectual constructs, 
there is, William James said, only 'a bloomin' buzzin' confusion.'" The paradigm 
of the Cold War, Huntington pointed out, did not account for many of the 
conflicts and other developments from 1945 to 1989; nevertheless, it summed up 
reality better than other paradigms did. In an age when so many academics and 
intellectuals, fearful of attacks from other academics and intellectuals, prefer 
the safety of mutually canceling subtleties, Huntington was asserting—and 
defending—the scholar's duty to say what he actually thinks in stark and general 
terms. 
<P>the book that emerged from his article, The Clash of Civilizations and the 
Remaking of World Order (1996), Huntington offered a wealth of other insights. 
He showed that whereas the West has generated ideologies, the East has generated 
religions—and explained that religion is now the more menacing force on the 
international scene. He pointed out, counterintuitively, that because communism 
was a Central European ideology, the Soviet Union was philosophically closer to 
the West than is the Eastern Orthodox Russia that has succeeded it. He reminded 
us that the Cold War was a fleeting event compared with the age-old struggle 
between the West and Islam. In the Middle Ages, Muslim armies advanced through 
Iberia as far as France, and through the Balkans as far as the gates of Vienna. 
A similar process of advance, demographically rather than militarily, is now 
under way in Europe. "The dangerous clashes of the future," Huntington wrote, 
"are likely to arise from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic 
intolerance, and Sinic [Chinese] assertiveness." 
<P>the years since his article and book were published, NATO has expanded into 
three Protestant-Catholic countries while leaving out several Eastern Orthodox 
countries, so that the map of NATO, with some exceptions, resembles that of 
medieval Western Christendom. Meanwhile, Christians continue to flee the Middle 
East as the specter of Islamic oppression rises in Lebanon, Syria, and the 
Palestinian territories. American church groups, liberal and conservative alike, 
have united to support Christians fighting for human rights in China, and 
against Muslims slaughtering Christians in Sudan. Huntington's ability to 
account for these and so many other phenomena within a general theory points up 
the lasting importance of his work. Meanwhile, where are the Kremlinologists who 
during the Cold War told us that the Soviet system was basically stable; or the 
Africanists who in the 1960s and 1970s predicted growth and development in 
places that have since been torn apart by war? 
<P>do Huntington's ideas apply to the current crisis stemming from the terrorist 
attacks in New York and Washington? He speaks with reluctance about specific 
policies the United States ought to pursue. Huntington has warned in the past 
that it is pointless to expect people who are not at all like us to become 
significantly more like us; this well-meaning instinct only causes harm. "In the 
emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash, Western belief in 
the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false, it is 
immoral, and it is dangerous." In the incipient war being led by the United 
States, the utmost caution is required to keep the focus on the brute fact of 
terrorism. He observes that Osama bin Laden, for his part, clearly hopes to 
incite civilizational conflict between Islam and the West. The United States 
must prevent this from happening, chiefly by assembling a coalition against 
terrorism that crosses civilizational lines. Beyond that, the United States must 
take this opportunity to accomplish two things: first, to draw the nations of 
the West more tightly together; and second, to try to understand more 
realistically how the world looks through the eyes of other people. This is a 
time for a kind of tough-minded humility in our objectives and for an implacable 
but measured approach in our methods. 
<P>he adds this coda, about the world in which we live: "It is a dangerous 
place, in which large numbers of people resent our wealth, power, and culture, 
and vigorously oppose our efforts to persuade or coerce them to accept our 
values of human rights, democracy, and capitalism. In this world America must 
learn to distinguish among our true friends who will be with us and we with them 
through thick and thin; opportunistic allies with whom we have some but not all 
interests in common; strategic partner-competitors with whom we have a mixed 
relationship; antagonists who are rivals but with whom negotiation is possible; 
and unrelenting enemies who will try to destroy us unless we destroy them 
first." 
<P>VIII 
<P>ington has never confused good intentions with clarity of analysis. He knows 
that the job of a political scientist is not necessarily to improve the world 
but to say what he thinks is going on in it—and then to prescribe a course of 
action that serves the interests of his government. In an article for Foreign 
Affairs in 1997, "The Erosion of American National Interests," he wrote, "At 
some point in the future, the combination of security threat and moral challenge 
will require Americans once again to commit major resources to the defense of 
national interests." Such a renewed mobilization, he continued, is easier to 
accomplish when it proceeds from "a low base" than when it is redirected from 
entrenched foreign-policy enterprises that are less vital to our security. Thus 
a restrained approach to the world might allow us in case of emergency to 
mobilize more quickly than if we were involved too deeply in too many places, in 
the service of either "particularistic" lobbies or some grand conception of 
human rights or how to organize the world. Real conservatism cannot aspire to 
lofty principles, because its task is to defend what already exists. The 
conservative dilemma is that conservatism's legitimacy can come only from being 
proved right by events, whereas liberals, whenever they are proved wrong, have 
universal principles to fall back on. Samuel Huntington has always held liberal 
ideals. But he knows that such ideals cannot survive without power, and that 
power requires careful upkeep. 
<P>American political science leaves any lasting intellectual monument, the work 
of Samuel Huntington will be one of its pillars. A passage in the conclusion of 
American Politics has always seemed to me to capture the essence of Huntington's 
enduring judgment and political sensibility: "Critics say that America is a lie 
because its reality falls so far short of its ideals. They are wrong. America is 
not a lie; it is a disappointment. But it can be a disappointment only because 
it is also a hope."</P></DIV><BR clear=all>
