    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Part of the shock that followed
the terrorist attacks of September 11th, was</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">the surprise, the unexpectedness.
America's citizenry were almost totally</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">unprepared, in their minds, for
the terrible reality.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">There's much to be said in this
context. But if we go deeper we see that</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">there was something missing in the
public, and general, understanding of the</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">possibilities. Above all, there
was little established background of</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">knowledge about the mental world
of those outside the American, or Western,</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">experience, and in particular, about
the mental world of the enemies of the</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">democratic way of life. One result
was the assumption that the enemies of</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">the Western culture can be won over
by goodwill; and that the West is to</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">blame if such approaches do not
work.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">This was not just the natural parochialism
of an apathetic population. It</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">pervaded the media and the educated
strata in general. Is there, or was</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">there, some specific fault in the
general presentation here of the outside</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">world in our books, our schools,
our debates? Clearly, the answer is "yes."</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">For many years, one can find two
main faults in the presentation to the</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">American mind of major elements
in the world. First, too little information</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">about those alien cultures and attitudes
was inculcated. Second, much of</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">what was inculcated was erroneous.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">The man in the street, with less
access to study, is still often better</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">served by his common sense than
the expert is by his expertise. Yet, the</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">general atmosphere is pervaded by
assumptions or preoccupations with little</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">empirical basis.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">How can a citizen be called educated
if he has been trained to misunderstand</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">the world?</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Let me specify. Our educational
system, which, Thomas Jefferson said, should</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">be "chiefly historical" for an adult
citizenry, was — to put it mildly — not</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">so. If we look at schools and universities
we must surely admit that. As a</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">result, a large section of our supposedly
educated class are only so</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">describable if we omit what Jefferson
thought to be the most vital point.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">On the one hand this affected our
whole culture; on the other, it resulted,</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">even in "higher" education, with
the substitution of various theorizings</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">that diverted attention from the
real world. In his inaugural lecture as</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Regius Professor of Modern History
at Oxford (quoted in my recent</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Reflections on a Ravaged Century),
Sir Michael Howard remarked of the "real</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">lessons of history" that these apply
to "people often of masterful</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">intelligence, trained usually in
law or economics or perhaps political</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">science, who have led their governments
into disastrous miscalculations</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">because they have no awareness whatever
of the historical background, the</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">cultural universe of the foreign
societies with which they have to deal. It</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">is an awareness for which no amount
of strategic or economic analysis, no</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">techniques of crisis management
or conflict resolution "can provide a</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">substitute."</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">And, if that is often so among the
foreign-policy elite, how much more so in</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">the academic circles where intrusive
facts can be even more easily kept out</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">of the mind</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">It is also the case that even in
the restricted area where "history" was</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">practiced, the academic (and other)
understanding of the earlier, Stalinist,</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Maoist, Ho-ist anti-Americanism,
was fatally distorted in the late 1960s,</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">probably as a result, or partly
so, of anti-Vietnam War atmospheres, so</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">that — even to this day — there
is much "in denial" about Stalinism and its</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">unappeasable hatred of the West.
It seems in part due to the fact that young</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Viet Cong groupies who went into
academe are now in high positions. But one</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">should not neglect the other academic
trope — the idea of being</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">non-judgmental; the intrusion of
suitable mind-blocking theory. All this,</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">moreover, still infects the glossy
media, as with the grotesquely falsified</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">CNN series on the Cold War.</span></p>
 <br>
 <br>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">So? First, back to Jefferson. We
cannot understand the world without the</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">study and understanding of real
history and real politics and beliefs. A</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">supposedly educated or academic
output that misses this is unreal. The</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">specialists, or theoreticians, who
have no such background are, in effect,</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">uneducated, and much more academic
attention should go to general realities.</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">Academics already established in
these fields need a good deal of</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">reeducation. Not that they are uninstructed,
but that they were instructed</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">in often-sophisticated theory and
formula, rather than in the empirical</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">realities. A double problem for
us in fact. We need more history, and better</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">history. We need less formula, and
less anti-Americanism. Not the only</span></p>
 
    <p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); ">problems, but big ones and long-term
ones.</span></p>
