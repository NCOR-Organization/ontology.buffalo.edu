      <P align=center><FONT face=Haettenschweiler size=5>A War Like No Other? 
      You Bet! By David Graham Du Bois </FONT></P><BR>
      <P align=left><FONT face=Verdana size=2>This "war against terrorism" is in 
      fact an open declaration of war <BR>against the peoples of the developing 
      world; initially the peoples of <BR>the Middle East and Africa, and 
      ultimately the peoples of South and <BR>Central America and the Caribbean, 
      all Asia, the South Pacific and the <BR>islands of the Seas - - some 
      four-fifths of humanity. <BR><BR>It is a desperate attempt to meet and 
      overcome this developing world's growing challenge to the continuation of 
      four centuries of European and American hegemonic domination, 
      exploitation, suppression, insult and injury by its executors in America 
      and Europe. <BR><BR>In pursuit of this objective the events of September 
      11 are being used to justify the imposition of a wide range of military 
      and socio-political measures gravely endangering democracy <BR>as we know 
      it; measures that have as their objective the emergence of an 
      <BR>authoritarian, military/corporate state in the U.S.A. This gives rise 
      <BR>to serious question as to who really planned and executed the 
      September <BR>11 events. <BR><BR>The fact that the overwhelming majority 
      of the peoples of the developing <BR>world are peoples of color, or are 
      perceived of as peoples of color, <BR>explains the ease with which support 
      among the majority populations of <BR>Europe and North America is being 
      generated behind the myth of a "war <BR>against terrorism". Four centuries 
      of the European African slave trade <BR>and the cruel exploitation of the 
      human and natural resources of the <BR>African continent have been and are 
      today justified by the myth of an <BR>inherent white superiority facing an 
      inherent black inferiority. <BR><BR>The church, the State, the academy and 
      the corporate boardroom led the effort, meeting with little resistance. 
      <BR><BR>Today hated Pakistanis and Indians in the U.K are called "blacks" 
      and hated Chechens in Russia are called "blacks". <BR><BR>The immediate 
      danger facing the world today is the conviction among <BR>white Americans, 
      including leaders in government, business and the <BR>military, that 
      peoples of color globally are inherently inferior to <BR>whites and are 
      therefore capable of committing, indeed eager to commit, <BR>the most 
      heinous of crimes against "the hated and envied European/American" This 
      widely held conviction, that has dominated US foreign policy from the 
      country's' earliest days, undermines reason and sanity in the execution of 
      this "war against terrorism". And, it also inhibits resistance. 
      <BR><BR>There is widespread wariness and considerable resistance to this 
      "war <BR>against terrorism" throughout the world of peoples of color, 
      although the media and government spokespersons minimize or ignore it. 
      And, although it is in great measure muted, confused and uninformed, there 
      is also widespread wariness and resistance to this "war against terrorism" 
      among peoples of color in the U.S. and throughout Europe. <BR><BR>In this 
      context consider the deafening silence of the TV pundits and the media 
      <BR>generally regarding the largest, most easily identifiable, homegrown 
      body of Moslems in the country, the black Nation of Islam and its leader 
      Minister Louis Farrakhan. The most strident and the most consistent voice 
      in America in support of the rights of the Palestinian people has been the 
      voice of Minister Farrakhan. <BR><BR>That black people in the U.S. listen 
      to his voice was dramatically demonstrated by the turn out for the 
      Million-Man March held on the Mall in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 16, 1995. 
      Anyone conversant with the-man/woman-on-the street in the black urban 
      community today knows the extent and the character of the guarded respect 
      in which "The Nation" is held in those communities across the country. At 
      the same time the pro-Israeli, Zionist establishment in the U.S. count 
      Minister Farrakhan as domestic enemy number one. And, no black leader that 
      refuses to condemn and castigate Minister Farrakhan can curry favor from 
      that establishment. <BR><BR>The drive to justify religious profiling in 
      order to seek out terrorists, a result of the September 11 events, opens 
      up the Nation of Islam to a major assault on two fronts: racial and 
      religious profiling. That assault has already begun and black communities 
      across the country know it. <BR><BR>Peoples of color around the world, but 
      particularly African peoples, <BR>were stung by the behavior of the U.S. 
      at the United Nations Conference <BR>Against Racism held in Durban, South 
      Africa recently. <BR><BR>In one grand, arrogant gesture, withdrawal, the 
      U.S. refused even to consider the charge that Israeli practice in the 
      Occupied Territories constitutes racism, and that reparations and 
      compensation for four centuries of African slavery, natural and human 
      exploitation and humiliation is justified. And yet, in answer to the 
      question: "Why do they hate us <BR>so?" comes the repeated matra over and 
      over and over: "It's not what <BR>we do. It's what we are." <BR><BR>How 
      does that jibe with the U.S. action in Durban and the current feeble 
      effort to convince the Palestinian and <BR>Arab masses that the U.S. is 
      now suddenly serious in its desire for the <BR>creation of a Palestinian 
      state? <BR><BR>The U.S. may be losing the propaganda battle on the Arab 
      speaking front <BR>to "the CNN of the Arab world", the Qatar-based Al 
      Jazeera satellite TV <BR>station, but domestically it's winning hands down 
      the propaganda battle <BR>for the minds of the American people. 
      <BR><BR>Efforts to convince us that life <BR>should "get back to normal", 
      to go out and "buy, buy, buy" as a patriotic duty, to return to the 
      airways without fear, love everybody, return to family stands in sharp 
      contrast with the content of popular media news and information programs. 
      <BR><BR>These bombard us with in depth reports on the anthrax scare, small 
      pox and other bioterrorism speculations, repeated reports of nuclear 
      capabilities in the hands of <BR>foreign terrorists, of deadly pollution 
      attacks on vulnerable air systems in office buildings and homes, 
      terrorists crop spraying planes, truck tankers of toxic materials ramming 
      buildings and on and on. <BR><BR>We are faced with airports swarming with 
      armed, uniformed soldiers and daily security lapses, all driving us into a 
      frenzy to "kill, kill, kill <BR>the terrorists and end this madness!" 
      <BR><BR>Strange to some, the most vociferous practitioner in this 
      propaganda <BR>effort is National Public Radio (NPR). <BR><BR>It would 
      appear the decision was <BR>made at the top of the corporate media 
      hierarchy to target that "sophisticated" American audience least accepting 
      of network TV news and <BR>analyses and the mainstream media; the 
      searchers for "alternative" sources that they believe NPR represents. 
      <BR><BR>As a practicing journalist for more than forty years, thirty of 
      which were spent working out of North <BR>and West Africa and the Middle 
      East, I know something about the news and <BR>analyses the American people 
      are provided from those parts of the <BR>developing world. <BR><BR>We are 
      not told the truth. And, of the little we are told most is a distortion of 
      the truth to make the U.S. look like "the good guys". <BR><BR>What we're 
      getting today from Afghanistan and environs is no different. How can 
      anyone expect the American people to know "why they <BR>hate us so"? 
      <BR><BR>The fact is they do not hate the American people. They hate the 
      <BR>policies of succeeding U.S. administrations. <BR><BR>Yes, they are 
      politically sophisticated enough to make that important distinction. The 
      war being waged against Afghanistan today is a monstrous act of State 
      terrorism. <BR><BR>If allowed by the peoples of the world it will be 
      extended to Iraq, and <BR>later to the other "rogue states" of U.S. 
      determination, opening the <BR>floodgates to a devastating race war 
      divided along the global color <BR>line. <BR><BR>In 1915 W. E. B. Du Bois 
      wrote: "Most men in this world are colored. A belief in humanity means a 
      belief in colored men. The future world will, in all reasonable 
      probability be what colored men make it." <BR><BR>It is this "reasonable 
      probability" the "war against terrorism" is intended to prevent. But, it 
      will only delay the inevitable. <BR><BR><I>David Graham Du Bois
