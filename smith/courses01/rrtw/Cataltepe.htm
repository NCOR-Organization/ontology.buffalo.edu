<P>An important article on the "New World Order" was published in <I><A 
href="http://www.enews.com/magazines/foreign_affairs/">Foreign Affairs</A></I> 
this past summer [<I>Foreign Affairs</I>, Summer 1993]. In the article, titled 
<B><I>The Clash of Civilizations?</I></B>, Harvard professor Samuel P. 
Huntington clearly articulated the perception of the world that had been taking 
shape since the breakdown of the Soviet Union. 
<P>The journal <I>Foreign Affairs</I> and its publisher are quite interesting in 
themselves: <I>Foreign Affairs</I> is a publication of the influential <B><A 
href="http://www.enews.com/magazines/foreign_affairs/welcome.html">Council on 
Foreign Relations</A></B>. This organization and its publications are the 
debating grounds for the American policy-making elite. The Council was 
established at the end of the World War I as a non-governmental think-tank. It 
represented the concerns of the various factions of the power elite in the 
formulation of the United States' foreign policy. The previous paradigm of the 
American foreign policy was based on the ideological competition between the U. 
S. and the Soviet Union. The article outlining the essentials of this policy was 
also originally published in the <I>Foreign Affairs</I>. Judging from the 
response and discussion it generated, Huntington's article can be considered as 
a similarly important document providing context for policies in the post Cold 
War world. 
<P>To begin with, the title of the article is quite interesting <I>The Clash of 
Civilizations?</I>. This expression, without the question mark, is one of the 
section headings in the infamous orientalist Bernard Lewis' 1990 article 
<B><I>The Roots of Muslim Rage</I></B> [<I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, September 
1990]. (This fact has been noted by most Muslim commentators of Huntington's 
article.) What is interesting to me in this title is the plural use of the word 
"civilization." The typical Eurocentric thinking usually spoke of one single 
civilization, namely the Western Civilization. The other civilizations were 
considered to be subjects of history. The acknowledgment of plurality of 
civilizations at our time indicates an important shift in thinking. Again, as 
many commentators observed, the first well-known attempt at the reformulation of 
the post Cold War Western world view was the declaration of the <B><I>End of 
History</I></B> by Francis Fukuyama, an official of the U. S. State Department, 
in 1988. Fukuyama was essentially talking about the ultimate triumph of the 
Western liberal capitalism in the whole world; sort of along the lines of 
millenarian Christian and Marxist traditions. He nevertheless noted the threat 
of "Islamic Fundamentalism" as the only --minor-- threat to this ultimate 
victory. But the immediate developments put Fukuyama's rosy picture into 
question. Then came the recycled Orientalists like Bernard Lewis who served the 
"Next Threat to West" which turned out to be the old one, Islam. Huntington 
starts with a broader perspective; he identifies seven or eight civilizations. 
However he also identifies Islamic civilization as the main threat to the 
Western civilization. 
<P>Huntington defines civilization as "highest cultural grouping of people and 
the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which 
distinguishes humans from other species." Then he goes on to identify the major 
civilizations that exist today, "Western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, 
Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African civilization." His major 
claim is that "the most important conflicts of the future will occur along the 
cultural fault lines separating these civilizations from one another." 
<P>Western critics of Huntington's thesis focused on the primacy of the nation 
state [<I>Foreign Affairs</I>, September/October 1993]. They claim that the 
nation state is still the primary actor on the world stage. Huntington does not 
deny this but adds that "civilization" will be the paradigm in which these 
primary actors are going to operate [<I>Foreign Affairs</I>, November/December 
1993]. The recent flare-ups of ethnic/religious conflicts were enough reason for 
many people to question the continued validity of the nation-state model. 
Huntington is proposing a paradigm in which to explain most of these conflicts 
rather than a solution to them. 
<P>Muslim critics of Huntington [Chaudry Muzaffar of Malaysia in <I>Third World 
Network Features</I>, Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey in <I>Izlenim</I>, October 1993] 
saw his article as a diversion in the service of West. As these critics 
rightfully note, Huntington paints an aggressive picture of the non-Western 
civilizations --particularly Islam-- while ignoring the (mis)deeds of the 
Western civilization whose dominance is being challenged. 
<P>However, the important issue is not whether Huntington is honest about the 
non-Western civilizations. The point is that the policy formulation for the U. 
S. will most likely take place within the paradigm that Huntington offers. 
Therefore whether one agrees with him or not, it is probably going to be a 
self-fulfilling prophecy. Huntington mentions "torn countries" which he defines 
as those countries "that have a fair degree of cultural homogeneity but are 
divided over whether their society belongs to one civilization or another." He 
particularly mentions Turkey in this group. Of course as anyone from Turkey 
would know, the debate on our Westernness versus Easternness is a familiar one. 
But it is critical for Islamic world in general and Turkey in particular to 
understand this new paradigm because the specific policies of the West can be 
decoded accurately only if we know the general framework that has generated 
them. As it is taking shape today, West is already conceptualizing --at least 
for public consumption-- the world in terms of an Islamic threat. In this case, 
Turkey as a "torn country" becomes a critical policy tool for them. Obviously 
Turkey is not of the Western civilization, but they would not want it to be of 
the Islamic civilization either. In this new "clash of civilizations" game, 
Turkey would best serve the Western interests as an element that is always on 
the edge, thus an unstabilizing element. We can be sure that the upcoming local 
elections in Turkey will be watched very closely in this context. 
<P>It should also be noted that the torn-country syndrome prevents Turkey from 
generating a useful paradigm for policy formulation, and as a result future does 
not look very bright. <!-- -- -->
