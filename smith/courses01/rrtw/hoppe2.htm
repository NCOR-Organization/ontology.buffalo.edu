            size=3>The classical argument in favor of free immigration runs as 
            follows: Other things being equal, businesses go to low-wage areas, 
            and labor moves to high-wage areas, thus affecting a tendency toward 
            the equalization of wage rates (for the same kind of labor) as well 
            as the optimal localization of capital. An influx of migrants into a 
            given-sized high-wage area will lower nominal wage rates. However, 
            it will not lower real wage rates if the population is below its 
            optimum size. To the contrary, if this is the case, the produced 
            output will increase over-proportionally, and real incomes will 
            actually rise. Thus, restrictions on immigration will harm the 
            protected domestic workers qua consumers more than they gain qua 
            producers. Moreover, immigration restrictions will increase the 
            "flight" of capital abroad (the export of capital which otherwise 
            might have stayed), still causing an equalization of wage rates 
            (although somewhat more slowly), but leading to a less than optimal 
            allocation of capital, thereby harming world living standards 
            all-around. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>In addition, traditionally labor unions, and nowadays 
            environmentalists, are opposed to free immigration, and this should 
            prima facie count as another argument in favor of a policy of free 
            immigration. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left></P>

            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>As it is stated, the above argument in favor of free 
            immigration is irrefutable and correct. It would be foolish to 
            attack it, just as it would be foolish to deny that free trade leads 
            to higher living standards than does protectionism. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>It would also be wrongheaded to attack the above case for 
            free immigration by pointing out that because of the existence of a 
            welfare state, immigration has become to a significant extent the 
            immigration of welfare-bums, who, even if the United States, for 
            instance, is below her optimal population point, do not increase but 
            rather decrease average living standards. For this is not an 
            argument against immigration but against the welfare state. To be 
            sure, the welfare state should be destroyed, root and branch. 
            However, in any case the problems of immigration and welfare are 
            analytically distinct problems, and they must be treated 
            accordingly.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The problem with the above argument is that it suffers from 
            two interrelated shortcomings which invalidate its unconditional 
            pro-immigration conclusion and/or which render the argument 
            applicable only to a highly unrealistic – long bygone – situation in 
            human history.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The first shortcoming will only be touched upon. To 
            libertarians of the Austrian school, it should be clear that what 
            constitutes "wealth" and "well-being" is subjective. Material wealth 
            is not the only thing that counts. Thus, even if real incomes rise 
            due to immigration, it does not follow that immigration must be 
            considered "good," for one might prefer lower living standards and a 
            greater distance to other people over higher living standards and a 
            smaller distance to others. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Instead, a second, related shortcoming will be the focus 
            here. With regard to a given territory into which people immigrate, 
            it is left unanalyzed who, if anyone, owns (controls) this 
            territory. In fact, in order to render the above argument 
            applicable, it is – implicitly – assumed that the territory in 
            question is unowned, and that the immigrants enter virgin territory 
            (open frontier). Obviously, this can no longer be assumed. If this 
            assumption is dropped, however, the problem of immigration takes on 
            an entirely new meaning and requires fundamental 
            rethinking.</FONT></P>

            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>For the purpose of illustration, let us first assume an 
            anarcho-capitalist society. Though convinced that such a society is 
            the only social order that can be defended as just, I do not want to 
            explain here why this is the case. Instead, I will employ it as a 
            conceptual benchmark, because this will help clear up the 
            fundamental misconception of most contemporary free immigration 
            advocates.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>All land is privately owned, including all streets, rivers, 
            airports, harbors, etc.. With respect to some pieces of land, the 
            property title may be unrestricted; that is, the owner is permitted 
            to do with his property whatever he pleases as long as he does not 
            physically damage the property owned by others. With respect to 
            other territories, the property title may be more or less severely 
            restricted. As is currently the case in some housing developments, 
            the owner may be bound by contractual limitations on what he can do 
            with his property (voluntary zoning), which might include 
            residential vs. commercial use, no buildings more than four stories 
            high, no sale or rent to Jews, Germans, Catholics, homosexuals, 
            Haitians, families with or without children, or smokers, for 
            example.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Clearly, under this scenario there exists no such thing as 
            freedom of immigration. Rather, there exists the freedom of many 
            independent private property owners to admit or exclude others from 
            their own property in accordance with their own unrestricted or 
            restricted property titles. Admission to some territories might be 
            easy, while to others it might be nearly impossible. In any case, 
            however, admission to the property of the admitting person does not 
            imply a "freedom to move around," unless other property owners 
            consent to such movements. There will be as much immigration or 
            non-immigration, inclusivity or exclusivity, desegregation or 
            segregagtion, non-discrimination or discrimination based on racial, 
            ethnic, linguistic, religious, cultural or whatever other grounds as 
            individual owners or associations of individual owners 
            allow.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Note that none of this, not even the most exclusive form of 
            segregationism, has anything to do with a rejection of free trade 
            and the adoption of protectionism. From the fact that one does not 
            want to associate with or live in the neighborhood of Blacks, Turks, 
            Catholics or Hindus, etc., it does not follow that one does not want 
            to trade with them from a distance. To the contrary, it is precisely 
            the absolute voluntariness of human association and separation – the 
            absence of any form of forced integration – that makes peaceful 
            relationships – free trade – between culturally, racially, 
            ethnically, or religiously distinct people possible. </FONT></P>

            size=3>In an anarcho-capitalist society there is no government and, 
            accordingly, no clear-cut distinction between inlanders (domestic 
            citizens) and foreigners. This distinction comes into existence only 
            with the establishment of a government, i.e., an institution which 
            possesses a territorial monopoly of aggression (taxation). The 
            territory over which a government's taxing power extends becomes 
            "inland," and everyone residing outside of this territory becomes a 
            foreigner. State borders (and passports), are an "unnatural" 
            (coercive) institution. Indeed, their existence (and that of a 
            domestic government) implies a two-fold distortion with respect to 
            peoples' natural inclination to associate with others. First, 
            inlanders cannot exclude the government (the taxman) from their own 
            property, but are subject to what one might call "forced 
            integration" by government agents. Second, in order to be able to 
            intrude on its subjects' private property so as to tax them, a 
            government must invariably take control of existing roads, and it 
            will employ its tax revenue to produce even more roads to gain even 
            better access to all private property, as a potential tax source. 
            Thus, this over-production of roads does not involve merely an 
            innocent facilitation of interregional trade – a lowering of 
            transaction costs – as starry-eyed economists would have us believe, 
            but it involves forced domestic integration (artificial 
            desegregation of separate localities). </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Moreover, with the establishment of a government and state 
            borders, immigration takes on an entirely new meaning. Immigration 
            becomes immigration by foreigners across state borders, and the 
            decision as to whether or not a person should be admitted no longer 
            rests with private property owners or associations of such owners 
            but with the government as the ultimate sovereign of all domestic 
            residents and the ultimate super-owner of all their properties. Now, 
            if the government excludes a person while even one domestic resident 
            wants to admit this very person onto his property, the result is 
            forced exclusion (a phenomenon that does not exist under private 
            property anarchism). Furthermore, if the government admits a person 
            while there is not even one domestic resident who wants to have this 
            person on his property, the result is forced integration (also 
            non-existent under private property anarchism).</FONT></P>

            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>It is now time to enrich the analysis through the 
            introduction of a few "realistic" empirical assumptions. Let us 
            assume that the government is privately owned. The ruler literally 
            owns the entire country within state borders. He owns part of the 
            territory outright (his property title is unrestricted), and he is 
            partial owner of the rest (as landlord or residual claimant of all 
            of his citizen-tenants real estate holdings, albeit restricted by 
            some kind of pre-existing rental contract). He can sell and bequeath 
            his property, and he can calculate and "realize" the monetary value 
            of his capital (his country).</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Traditional monarchies – and kings – are the closest 
            historical examples of this form of government. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>What will a king's typical immigration and emigration policy 
            be? Because he owns the entire country's capital value, he will, 
            assuming no more than his self-interest, tend to choose migration 
            policies that preserve or enhance rather than diminish the value of 
            his kingdom.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>As far as emigration is concerned, a king will want to 
            prevent the emigration of productive subjects, in particular of his 
            best and most productive subjects, because losing them would lower 
            the value of the kingdom. Thus, for example, from 1782 until 1824 a 
            law prohibited the emigration of skilled workmen from Britain. On 
            the other hand, a king will want to expell his non-productive and 
            destructive subjects (criminals, bums, beggars, gypsies, vagabonds, 
            etc.), for their their removal from his territory would increase the 
            value of his realm. For this reason Britain expelled tens of 
            thousands of common criminals to North America and Australia. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>On the other hand, as far as immigration policy is concerned, 
            a king would want to keep the mob, as well as all people of inferior 
            productive capabilities, out. People of the latter category would 
            only be admitted temporarily, if at all, as seasonal workers without 
            citizenship, and they would be barred from permanent property 
            ownership. Thus, for example, after 1880 large numbers of Poles were 
            hired as seasonal workers in Germany. A king would only permit the 
            permanent immigration of superior or at least above-average people; 
            i.e., those, whose residence in his kingdom would increase his own 
            property value. Thus, for example, after 1685 (with the revocation 
            of the Edict of Nantes) tens of thousands of Huguenots were 
            permitted to settle in Prussia; and similarly Peter the Great, 
            Frederick the Great, and Maria Theresia later promoted the 
            immigration and settlement of large numbers of Germans in Russia, 
            Prussia, and the eastern provinces of Austria-Hungary. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>In brief, while through his immigration policies a king might 
            not entirely avoid all cases of forced exclusion or forced 
            integration, such policies would by and large do the same as what 
            private property owners would do, if they could decide who to admit 
            and who to exclude. That is, the king would be highly selective and 
            very much concerned about improving the quality of the resident 
            human capital so as to drive property values up, not 
down.</FONT></P>

            size=3>Migration policies become predictably different, once the 
            government is publicly owned. The ruler no longer owns the country's 
            capital value, but only has current use of it. He cannot sell or 
            bequeath his position as ruler; he is merely a temporary caretaker. 
            Moreover, "free entry" into the position of a caretaker government 
            exists. Anyone can, in principle, become the ruler of the 
            country.</FONT></P>

            size=3>What are a democracy's migration policies? Once again 
            assuming no more than self-interest (maximizing monetary and psychic 
            income: money and power), democratic rulers tend to maximize current 
            income, which they can appropriate privately, at the expense of 
            capital values, which they cannot appropriate privately. Hence, in 
            accordance with democracy's inherent egalitarianism of 
            one-man-one-vote, they tend to pursue a distinctly egalitarian – 
            non-discriminatory – emigration and immigration policy.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>As far as emigration policy is concerned, this implies that 
            for a democratic ruler it makes little, if any, difference whether 
            productive or unproductive people, geniuses or bums leave the 
            country. They have all one equal vote. In fact, democratic rulers 
            might well be more concerned about the loss of a bum than that of a 
            productive genius. While the loss of the latter would obviously 
            lower the capital value of the country and loss of the former might 
            actually increase it, a democratic ruler does not own the country. 
            In the short run, which most interests a democratic ruler, the bum, 
            voting most likely in favor of egalitarian measures, might be more 
            valuable than the productive genius who, as egalitarianism's prime 
            victim, will more likely vote against the democratic ruler. For the 
            same reason, a democratic ruler, quite unlike a king, undertakes 
            little to actively expell those people whose presence within the 
            country constitutes a negative externality (human trash, which 
            drives individual property values down). In fact, such negative 
            externalities – unproductive parasites, bums, and criminals – are 
            likely to be his most reliable supporters.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>As far as immigration policies are concerned, the incentives 
            and disincentives are likewise distorted, and the results are 
            equally perverse. For a democratic ruler, it also matters little 
            whether bums or geniuses, below or above-average civilized and 
            productive people immigrate into the country. Nor is he much 
            concerned about the distinction between temporary workers (owners of 
            work permits) and permanent, property owning immigrants (naturalized 
            citizens). In fact, bums and unproductive people may well be 
            preferable as residents and citizens, because they cause more 
            so-called "social" problem," and democratic rulers thrive on the 
            existence of such problems. Moreover, bums and inferior people will 
            likely support his egalitarian policies, whereas geniuses and 
            superior people will not. The result of this policy of 
            non-discrimination is forced integration: the forcing of masses of 
            inferior immigrants onto domestic property owners who, if they could 
            have decided for themselves, would have sharply discriminated and 
            chosen very different neighbors for themselves. Thus, the United 
            States immigration laws of 1965, as the best available example of 
            democracy at work, eliminated all formerly existing "quality" 
            concerns and the explicit preference for European immigrants and 
            replaced it with a policy of almost complete non-discrimination 
            (multi-culturalism). </FONT></P>

            size=3>Indeed, though rarely noticed, the immigration policy of a 
            democracy is the mirror image of its policy toward internal 
            population movements: toward the voluntary association and 
            dissociation, segregation and desegregation, and the physical 
            distancing and approximating of various private property owners. 
            Like a king, a democratic ruler will promote spatial 
            over-integration by over-producing the "public good" of roads. 
            However, for a democratic ruler, unlike a king, it will not be 
            sufficient that everyone can move next door to anyone else on 
            government roads. Concerned about his current income and power 
            rather than capital values and constrained by egalitarian 
            sentiments, a democratic ruler will tend to go even further. Through 
            non-discrimination laws – one cannot discriminate against Germans, 
            Jews, Blacks, Catholics, Hindus, homosexuals, etc. – the government 
            will want to open even the physical access and entrance to 
            everyone's property to everyone else. Thus, it is hardly surprising 
            that the so-called "Civil Rights" legislation in the United States, 
            which outlawed domestic discrimination on the basis of color, race, 
            national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, 
            disability, etc., and which thereby actually mandated forced 
            integration, coincided with the adoption of a non-discriminatory 
            immigration policy; i.e., mandated inter-national desegregagtion 
            (forced integration).</FONT></P>

            size=3>The current situation in the United States and in Western 
            Europe has nothing whatsoever to do with "free" immigration. It is 
            forced integration, plain and simple, and forced integration is the 
            predictable outcome of democratic – one-man-one-vote – rule. 
            Abolishing forced integration requires a de-democratization of 
            society, and ultimately the abolition of democracy. More 
            specifically, the authority to admit or exclude should be stripped 
            from the hands of the central government and re-assigned to the 
            states, provinces, cities, towns, villages, residential districts, 
            and ultimately to private property owners and their voluntary 
            associations. The means to achieve this goal are decentralization 
            and secession (both inherently un-democratic, and un-majoritarian). 
            One would be well on the way toward a restoration of the freedom of 
            association and exclusion as it is implied in the idea and 
            institution of private property, and much of the social strife 
            currently caused by forced integration would disappear, if only 
            towns and villages could and would do what they did as a matter of 
            course until well into the nineteenth century in Europe and the 
            United States: to post signs regarding entrance requirements to the 
            town, and once in town for entering specific pieces of property (no 
            beggars or bums or homeless, but also no Moslems, Hindus, Jews, 
            Catholics, etc.); to kick out those who do not fulfill these 
            requirements as trespassers; and to solve the "naturalization" 
            question somewhat along the Swiss model, where local assemblies, not 
            the central government, determine who can and who cannot become a 
            Swiss citizen.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>What should one hope for and advocate as the relatively 
            correct immigration policy, however, as long as the democratic 
            central state is still in place and successfully arrogates the power 
            to determine a uniform national immigration policy? The best one may 
            hope for, even if it goes against the "nature" of a democracy and 
            thus is not very likely to happen, is that the democratic rulers act 
            as if they were the personal owners of the country and as if they 
            had to decide who to include and who to exclude from their own 
            personal property (into their very own houses). This means following 
            a policy of utmost discrimination: of strict discrimination in favor 
            of the human qualities of skill, character, and cultural 
            compatibility.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>More specifically, it means distinguishing strictly between 
            "citizens" (naturalized immigrants) and "resident aliens" and 
            excluding the latter from all welfare entitlements. It means 
            requiring as necessary, for resident alien status as well as for 
            citizenship, the personal sponsorship by a resident citizen and his 
            assumption of liability for all property damage caused by the 
            immigrant. It implies requiring an existing employment contract with 
            a resident citizen; moreover, for both categories but especially 
            that of citizenship, it implies that all immigrants must demonstrate 
            through tests not only (English) language proficiency, but 
            all-around superior (above-average) intellectual performance and 
            character structure as well as a compatible system of values – with 
            the predictable result of a systematic pro-European immigration 
            bias. </FONT></P>
