      <P><I>San Francisco</I> </P>
      <P>As a former <I>Nation</I> contributor and a longtime <I>Nation</I> 
      reader, I congratulate you for running Richard Falk's "<A 
      href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20011029&amp;s=falk">Ends and 
      Means: Defining a Just War</A>" [Oct. 29]. It is a powerful antidote to 
      some of the confused and retro thinking that has beset a certain segment 
      of the left since September 11. Just as old generals want to fight the 
      last war all over again, some veterans of the peace movement have a 
      knee-jerk tendency to think this is Vietnam all over again, or even the 
      Gulf War. But it's not. The Gulf of Tonkin attack never happened. 
      September 11 did, with gruesome results. The world has changed. </P>
      <P>Like Falk, for the first time in my adult life, I find myself 
      supporting a war against a very real enemy--what Christopher Hitchens 
      correctly calls "Islamic fascism." I appreciate the fact that Falk's 
      endorsement of war against "apocalyptic terrorism" was nuanced, measured 
      and admitted all the possible pitfalls. </P>
      <P>I also agree that in retrospect the NATO bombing of Kosovo looks like 
      not such a bad thing. Milosevic is gone, and the United States and the 
      West helped to stop, albeit belatedly, the ethnic cleansing of 
      Muslims--something bin Laden and the Taliban seem to have overlooked. 
      Wars, even just wars like World War II, are inherently awful, but 
      sometimes they are necessary, and sometimes, as in Kosovo, bombing 
      actually works.</P>

      <P>Richard Falk (a friend whom I admire and respect for his long advocacy 
      of peace and justice) has said this is "the first truly just war since 
      World War II." I have puzzled over this. How can a war be "truly just" 
      that involves the daily killing of civilians; that is terrorizing the 
      people of Afghanistan, causing hundreds of thousands to leave their homes 
      to escape the bombs; that has little chance of finding those who planned 
      the September 11 attacks (and even if found, no chance that this would 
      stop terrorism); and that can only multiply the ranks of people who are 
      angry at this country, from whose ranks terrorists are born? The stories 
      of the effects of our bombing are beginning to come through, in bits and 
      pieces: the wounded children arriving across the border, one barely two 
      months old, swathed in bloody bandages; the Red Cross warehouses bombed, 
      the use of deadly cluster bombs, a small mountain village bombed and 
      entire families wiped out. </P>
      <P>That is only a few weeks into the bombing, The "war against terrorism" 
      has become a war against innocent men, women and children, who are in no 
      way responsible for the terrorist attack on New York. I believe the 
      supporters of the war have confused a just cause with a just war. A cause 
      may be just--like ending terrorism. But it does not follow that going to 
      war on behalf of that cause, with the inevitable mayhem that follows, is 
      just. </P>
      <P>Falk talks of "limited military action." But the momentum of war rides 
      roughshod over limits. Atrocities are explained by the deceptive language 
      of "accident," "military targets," "collateral damage." Killing innocent 
      people in war is not an "accident." It is an inevitability. The moral 
      equation in Afghanistan is clear. Civilian casualties are certain. The 
      outcome is uncertain. Use the money allotted our huge military machine to 
      combat starvation and disease around the world. One-third of our military 
      budget would provide water and sanitation facilities for the billion 
      people worldwide who have none. </P>
      <P>Let us be a more modest nation. The modest nations of the world don't 
      face the threat of terrorism. Let us pull back from being a military 
      superpower and become a humanitarian superpower. We, and everyone else, 
      will then be more secure.</P>

      <P>Here is bad news indeed: Our friend Richard Falk, speaker of truth to 
      power, guru to activists, antiestablishmentarian par excellence, has 
      cloned himself. We now have the old Falk, on October 8 calling for "A Just 
      Response" in his prophetic voice and on October 29 the new Falk "Defining 
      a Just War" in tones of neorealism. </P>
      <P>Those who took to heart the old Falk's admonition that this is "above 
      all, a war without military solutions" are now chastised by the new Falk 
      for being "irrelevant to meeting the central challenge of restoring some 
      sense of security among our citizenry." The old Falk told us that 
      "reliance on the rule of law," possibly through a due process trial under 
      UN authority, "would be a major step in seeking to make the struggle 
      against terrorism enjoy the genuine support of the entire organized 
      international community." The new Falk says this is pie in the sky, since 
      the United States would never agree to such a trial, which in any case 
      would only offer Osama bin Laden an opportunity to have himself declared a 
      bona fide legal martyr. </P>
      <P>The old Falk declares "the only way to win this 'war' (if war it 
      is)...is with a credible commitment to the global promotion of social 
      justice." Correction from the new Falk: "Global suffering and 
      injustice...cannot be addressed so long as this movement of global 
      terrorism is at large." True enough, both the old and the new Falk call 
      for limited ends and means. But, given the precedents of US behavior in 
      Central America, Serbia and Iraq, how realistic is that demand? We are 
      bombing a country in which there was nothing left to bomb to begin with. 
      </P>
      <P>In dealing with this greatest of contemporary crimes against humanity, 
      a judicious use of force cannot be ruled out altogether. But perhaps the 
      real realist is Donald Rumsfeld, who warns that bin Laden may never be 
      found and that the Taliban are not about to roll over and play dead. We 
      can all hope that this prediction will turn out to be wrong. In the 
      meantime what is needed is better security, better intelligence, better 
      communication and that commitment to global justice, both criminal and 
      social. Easier said than done, but absolutely necessary. Will the old Falk 
      please stand up? We need you, Richard! </P>

      <P>Richard Falk does not bother to tell us on what evidence he bases his 
      assertion that "a response that includes military action is essential to 
      diminish the threat of repetition" of the terrorist acts, though this is 
      the major premise for his conclusion that a war in Afghanistan might be 
      just. Falk thinks that invoking the well-known "extremism" and 
      "fanaticism" of bin Laden's brand of Islam is enough to assure us that he 
      and his adherents will strike and strike again unless they are 
      eliminated--liquidated, to use the apt if archaic terminology of a certain 
      brand of Marxism--as if such a feat were either easy or sufficient. Though 
      Falk's call for carefully limited ends and means is a welcome one, if 
      utopian under the current circumstances, his major premise invites the 
      very excesses he warns against. </P>
      <P>The Bush Administration lost the "war against terrorism" the moment it 
      began bombing Afghanistan, and the longer the bombing continues the more 
      serious the loss. Military action in Afghanistan has already inflamed 
      Muslims around the world. Pakistanis are reportedly crossing the border to 
      join the Taliban, while support for the US effort melts away among 
      moderates in that country. Each new instance of "collateral damage" feeds 
      the fires. But, more profoundly, the improbability of achieving anything 
      like a consensual government in Kabul in the wake of the US adventure 
      insures that Afghanistan will continue to be the festering sore nurturing 
      the pathology we are combating. </P>
      <P>The military campaign, moreover, has only the remotest chance of 
      capturing bin Laden and the major leaders of Al Qaeda. Even were it to do 
      so, there is no reason to suppose that terror directed at US and other 
      targets would stop. On the contrary, the operation that succeeded in 
      shaking the United States to its roots on September 11 was an amateur 
      affair, guided and financed on a minor scale by Al Qaeda, if we are to 
      believe the intelligence released so far, but scarcely dependent upon such 
      backing. Only determined police work--of the sort being carried out 
      now--by competent and coordinated agencies of law enforcement (something 
      we still lack in this country) could be expected to meet this threat. 
      Military action is irrelevant to it. </P>
      <P>We have lost the war. Now it is up to what remains of the left and to 
      religiously based opposition movements to try to moderate the scale of the 
      damage by insisting that the Administration refuse the next step urged by 
      Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and others, who have openly 
      advocated carrying the war to Iraq and beyond. And we must insist, as 
      well, that the United States reverse course in the Middle East, starting 
      with its unconditional support for Israel and extending to its broad 
      tolerance for the despotic regimes that protect Israel's flanks while 
      helping to slake our insatiable thirst for oil.</P>

      <P>After asserting that the war in Afghanistan is just, Richard Falk 
      undermines his conclusion by explaining how the campaign fails to meet his 
      requirements for a just war. He declares that legitimacy must be based on 
      the adoption of "goals that seem reasonably connected with the attack," 
      yet points out that "goals have not been clarified, and US leaders have 
      used grandiose language about ending terrorism and destroying the global 
      terrorist network." He states that a just war must avoid damage to 
      civilians, yet air campaigns almost inevitably involve serious casualties 
      to civilians and civilian infrastructure. He states that "force must not 
      be greater than that needed to achieve an acceptable military result," but 
      the war in Afghanistan is not based on achieving any specific military 
      result. </P>
      <P>He states that the force employed "must not be greater than the 
      provoking cause," but the force applied to Afghanistan quickly exceeded 
      the force used by the suicide bombers. He states that "force must not be 
      directed even against enemy personnel if they are subject to capture, 
      wounded or under control," yet George W. Bush's "wanted dead or alive" 
      declaration violates that requirement. And he states that "force should be 
      used only if nonviolent means to achieve military goals are unavailable," 
      yet the absence of military goals in this instance makes an analysis of 
      this requirement impossible. </P>
      <P>If the goal is to bring terrorists to justice in court, history 
      illustrates that nonmilitary approaches work. If the goal is to counter 
      Islamic extremism, recent developments in Iran, for example, demonstrate 
      that nonviolent means can moderate apparently intractable regimes. </P>
      <P>Eliminating the underlying causes that fuel terrorism would provide 
      more security in the long run. Patience is necessary, but not passivity. 
      Law enforcement agencies would still vigorously arrest and prosecute 
      criminals. As Falk himself points out, "Excessive reliance on the military 
      will backfire badly, further imperiling the security of Americans and 
      others, spreading war and destruction far afield, as well as emboldening 
      the government to act at home in ways that weaken US democracy.... the 
      militarist fallacy involves an excessive reliance on military force in a 
      manner that magnifies the threat it is trying to diminish or eliminate." 
      And he acknowledges that the Administration is deeply committed to 
      unilateralism, which is characterized by a "determination to achieve 
      security for the United States by military means." Given this recognition, 
      how he believes the United States can wage a just war against terrorism 
      boggles my mind. </P>
      <P>By accepting the US prerogative to "destroy and restructure regimes" 
      like the Taliban, Falk puts himself on a slippery slope. Whatever the 
      options may be for dealing with oppressive regimes, vesting that power in 
      the hands of the United States is not the answer. Perhaps Bush will limit 
      the war to trying to overthrow the Taliban, as Falk prefers. But I suspect 
      Falk is deluding himself if he believes that the West can destroy the Al 
      Qaeda network and similar networks that emerge. Such counterproductive 
      reliance on force resembles the effort to stop violence in the United 
      States by beefing up police forces, building more prisons and resorting to 
      capital punishment.</P>

      <P>Richard Falk's endorsement of a limited war is fraught with 
      immeasurable harm. Thousands of refugees are fleeing daily; the United 
      Nations is predicting the death of 100,000 children; and hate for 
      Americans is pouring into the streets of Pakistan, Indonesia and other 
      Muslim countries. We are creating the terrorists that will visit terror 
      upon our children. Pakistan, with its nuclear arsenal, may be 
      destabilized. Innocents have been killed, and we may face a fractionalized 
      and warfaring post-Taliban Afghanistan. </P>
      <P>There was another way. Treat the attacks on September 11 as a crime 
      against humanity (mass or systematic killing of civilians), establish a UN 
      tribunal, extradite or, if that fails, capture the suspects with a UN 
      force and try them. The US experience with Libya demonstrates both the 
      perils of a military response and the possibilities for international 
      justice. US officials believed that the 1986 bombing of Libya led to the 
      downing of Pan Am 103 and that more bombing would lead to a spiraling 
      cycle of violence. The United States turned to the UN, which applied 
      international pressure; eventually the Libyans extradited the suspects for 
      trial. </P>
      <P>The objections Falk makes to such a tribunal revolve primarily around 
      his belief that Washington would not accept such a court, in part because 
      the court might not be authorized to give the death penalty. But since 
      when should respected international legal experts like Falk, who generally 
      favor peaceful resolutions of conflicts, shy away from arguing what is 
      right simply because they believe the United States will not listen? Falk 
      says that it is "unreasonable to expect the US government to rely on the 
      UN to fulfill its defensive needs." But Falk did not think that it was 
      unreasonable for the Kuwaitis to rely on the UN to counteract Iraqi 
      aggression in 1990. Is Falk bowing to US exceptionalism--the UN is good 
      for everybody else, but not for the only superpower? </P>
      <P>It is remarkable that Falk, while recognizing that the global role of 
      the United States has given rise to widespread resentment that fuels the 
      terrorist impulse, claims that this role "cannot be addressed so long as 
      this movement of global terrorism is at large." But it is now that we must 
      examine this resentment: our tilt in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the 
      use of the Persian Gulf as a US base and support for corrupt, 
      authoritarian regimes. We must do so not to "give in to terrorists" but to 
      promote a more just and peaceful world and to enhance our long-term 
      security. To do so only when the global terrorist movement is no longer 
      "at large" insures that such an examination will never occur. </P>
      <P>Developing a proper response to terrorism is incredibly difficult, and 
      no short-term solution seems particularly attractive. Only by taking the 
      road toward creating a more equal, democratic and just world can we create 
      conditions of security from terrorism for our children. Bombing 
      Afghanistan--whatever the justness of the cause--seems the wrong way to 
      start down that path.</P>

      <P>Richard Falk deftly analyzes the inadequacies of the 
      "antiwar/pacifist," "legalist/UN" and "militarist" approaches to the war 
      on terrorism. As someone who has made a career in conflict emergency 
      response in the UN, I don't entirely disagree with Falk's pointing out the 
      UN's difficulties under its charter in dealing effectively with Al Qaeda, 
      a "transnational actor that cannot be definitively linked to a state," 
      which is "more the sponsor of the state rather than the other way around." 
      Nevertheless, the UN has an important role in defining the <I>casus 
      belli</I> that was the September 11 attack and certifying the armed 
      response now under way, and Falk misses that point. Mary Robinson, the UN 
      High Commissioner for Human Rights, has issued a statement that the 
      attacks involved "a widespread, deliberate targeting of a civilian 
      population" and constituted a crime against humanity. She then noted that 
      all countries have a responsibility under international law to help bring 
      the attackers to justice, but that in the absence of ratification of the 
      1998 International Criminal Court by the required number of countries, 
      there was no appropriate venue for prosecution. This is where I had hoped 
      that Falk's synthesis at the end of his piece was heading, arguing for 
      appropriate "limited means and ends." For there are now dozens if not 
      scores of venues for the prosecution of, <I>inter alia</I>, war crimes, 
      torture, genocide, slavery and piracy: the national courts of countries 
      that are signatories of the Geneva Conventions, the torture and genocide 
      conventions. In fact, under the concept of universal jurisdiction, which 
      has evolved steadily if quietly in the past few years, no less than nine 
      European countries have brought prosecutions. (It was the 1998-99 
      extradition hearings in Britain of Gen. Augusto Pinochet that revealed the 
      extent of this evolution.) </P>
      <P>Limited means and ends. US intelligence locates terrorist 
      concentrations; aircraft attack training and administrative centers and 
      suppress air defenses; special operations forces surgically attack the 
      concentrations, arresting those who surrender and killing those who resist 
      violently. Then, the terrorists are brought before national courts in 
      Europe for prosecution in cases brought by relatives of the dead or by the 
      governments in the countries concerned. Austria, Belgium, France and Spain 
      have already prosecuted foreign individuals, under the aegis of universal 
      jurisdiction, for crimes of murder, arson, assault, disappearance and 
      crimes against humanity, all of which occurred on September 11. It is 
      precisely the enormity of the attacks that might make the Administration 
      and Congress more amenable to ratification of the International Criminal 
      Court statute, and to support of the concept of universal jurisdiction. 
      </P>
      <P>Falk is a strong proponent of universal jurisdiction and was one of the 
      organizers of a panel of international legal scholars in January 2001 that 
      produced the "Princeton Principles on Universal Jurisdiction," an attempt 
      to clarify the concept and to address the practical problems of bringing 
      prosecutions. He apparently didn't see universal jurisdiction as an 
      important component of a limited and appropriate US response to September 
      11.</P>

      <P>I have admired Richard Falk's writing over the years, but his article 
      on a "just war" misses the mark. To label the September 11 attacks 
      "apocalyptic terrorism" is ludicrous--worthy of Bush Administration 
      propaganda. So also is his point that Osama bin Laden's "proclaimed goal" 
      is a genocidal war of "Islam against the West." That's nonsense right out 
      of the odious Samuel Huntington's <I>Clash of Civilizations</I>. Isn't a 
      war to rid the world of evil apocalyptic? </P>
      <P>Falk should take some time to read bin Laden's proclamations rather 
      than impose Huntington's words on him. He'll see that the number-one 
      driving force behind bin Laden is the US occupation and corruption of 
      Saudi Arabia. On this point bin Laden is correct, and Falk is wrong in 
      saying that his "persisting threat [is] well outside any framework of 
      potential reconciliation or even negotiation." The United States has only 
      to agree to leave Saudi Arabia and bin Laden would give up his war on the 
      United States. That's a negotiable proposition, except for the fact that 
      the United States would never consider giving up its occupation of Saudi 
      Arabia. It would destroy all Islamic nations with nuclear weapons before 
      considering that. Who is apocalyptic? </P>
      <P>It is well to remember that the United States is at war with Arab 
      nationalism and has been for years. The only new thing is that a major 
      attack occurred on US soil. If Falk and others don't like being attacked, 
      they need to find a way of putting an end to war, not of legitimizing it. 
      Let's face it: The United States has been dealing out terror on a huge 
      scale for a century. That is what should make us outraged.</P>

      <P>Richard Falk wrote an edifying gift to those who make a distinction 
      between anti-Americanism and anti-imperialism. The former means a priori 
      rejection of whatever position Washington takes on a given international 
      issue. Anti-imperialism, on the other hand, is a normative critique of the 
      context, purpose and implications of particular policies. Falk is on solid 
      ground in characterizing the current military action "against apocalyptic 
      terrorism" as a just war. The point I wish to add to Falk's analysis is 
      that the primary victims of the Taliban have been and will be the people 
      of Afghanistan. Mullah Omar and company might soon conclude that the 
      pathological crime of September 11 was unwise, but the chances are nil 
      that they will come to admit their role in the destruction of Afghanistan 
      and the decimation of its people. </P>
      <P>It is therefore possible that at the end of the ongoing war in 
      Afghanistan Osama bin Laden will be out of the picture, but the Taliban 
      under a new leadership will be allowed to stay on in exchange for severing 
      its alliance with global terrorists. What will not change, however, is the 
      theocratic regime's cruelty toward the Afghans who disagree with it. For 
      the <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre </I>of the Taliban, representing a radical version of 
      puritanical Islam, is denial of human rights and suppression of the idea 
      of political equality. Events in the Islamic Republic of Iran illustrate 
      the point. The militant puritans controlling the Iranian state and society 
      are trying to normalize, in the hope of reviving the country's depressed 
      economy, their diplomatic and trade relations with nearly all nations of 
      the world, but they continue to brutalize their secular critics at 
      home.</P>

      <P>Professor Falk has been a clear voice in opposition to many of the 
      worst crimes of the century, and I am sad to hear him speaking out in 
      defense of any kind of killing. The modern way of waging war renders the 
      abstractions of just-war theory obsolete. I was most disturbed by Falk's 
      statement, "Whatever the global role of the United States...it cannot be 
      addressed so long as this movement of global terrorism is at large and 
      prepared to carry on with its demonic work." Does this mean that 
      paramilitaries in Colombia, killer soldiers in Israel or pilots dropping 
      bombs on Iraq should be given free rein to terrorize people while we focus 
      our energies on opposing global terrorism? People are suffering now in 
      Afghanistan, in Colombia, in Palestine, in Iraq and so many other places 
      as a result of our government's violence. Perhaps, if we can make the 
      world more just there will be fewer people angry enough to commit the 
      kinds of unspeakable crimes we witnessed on September 11.</P>

      <P>Falk ends his excellent analysis with a call to action: It is "only the 
      vigilance of an active citizenry" that will lead to victory. Americans 
      must understand, however, that it is not just in America that people are 
      terrified; and it is not just here that the potential for "apocalyptic 
      terrorism" exists, although we are certainly the preferred target. A sense 
      of foreboding has descended, worldwide; our collective future hangs in the 
      balance, and at this juncture it is not at all clear that the United 
      States will preserve it by observing the four principles of 
      discrimination, proportionality, humanity and necessity. What does seem 
      clear, however, along with our greatly narrowed access to information 
      since September 11, is that no one at higher levels of government is 
      willing to listen. Where and when and how will this "active citizenry" be 
      heard?</P>

      <P>With each passing day, my assessment shifts to reach the conclusion 
      that the United States is waging an unjust war in Afghanistan, and it is 
      doing so in a manner that is likely to have severe blowback consequences. 
      I was misled by the language of George W. Bush, Colin Powell and others, 
      which seemed at the time to exhibit an understanding that this was a 
      drastically different kind of war that required a core reliance on 
      nonmilitary approaches. I accepted the claim that it was necessary to make 
      some selective use of force so as to displace the Taliban and to disable 
      to the extent possible the Al Qaeda network. I also proceeded from the 
      premise that the threat posed was of an unprecedented magnitude, both 
      because it successfully used weapons of mass destruction against US 
      civilian society in a gruesome manner that revealed its pervasive 
      vulnerability, and because there was every likelihood of efforts to repeat 
      the attack in even more devastating forms in the future. </P>
      <P>Particularly in response to Howard Zinn, with whom I cannot imagine 
      ever disagreeing on any core issue, my initial reference to the 
      Afghanistan war as a just war was a technical matter. It qualified as a 
      just war because the scope of the military response seemed initially to be 
      proportional to the gravity of the attack and the continuing threat of 
      further attacks, but as with World War II, the prospect of significant 
      civilian casualties is consistent with such a conclusion, and an 
      inevitable effect of any recourse to war, however justified the cause. 
      War, even as a necessary instrument to restore security, is inherently 
      cruel in its effects on innocent civilians, creating an urgent moral 
      imperative that we work for nonviolent forms of global governance and 
      conflict resolution. Tragically, we are not there yet and must adopt the 
      least bad available alternative, which I had hoped (falsely, it turns out) 
      would be a limited war with primary reliance on nonmilitary solutions. 
      And, of course, I am ready to join Zinn and others in seeking to make our 
      country "a humanitarian superpower," but in the meantime nothing is 
      possible until the Al Qaeda sword dangling above our collective existence 
      is removed. </P>
      <P>To clarify, the September 11 attack was a criminal, warlike assault on 
      this country that engaged the right of self-defense under international 
      law and morality. How to exercise this right under such unprecedented 
      circumstances, in which the main adversary is a nonstate actor, challenged 
      the imagination to combine effectiveness with legitimacy. I can now say, 
      as some of my critics perceived from the outset, that our government seems 
      incapable of learning from its past moral and political disasters, 
      especially the excessive reliance on bombing to achieve political goals. 
      Any satisfactory US recourse to war had to make every reasonable effort to 
      minimize civilian casualties. The use of cluster bombs, the reliance on 
      B-52 carpet-bombing, the failure to adapt tactics in light of targeting 
      errors, combine to produce disastrous results from a moral, legal and 
      political perspective. The political impact of relying on indiscriminate 
      and cruel high-tech military tactics while shielding one's own forces from 
      serious risk of casualty confirms the worst images of the US role in the 
      world, especially in the Islamic portions of the Third World. The 
      predictable result is to inflame anti-Americanism around the world and to 
      sow seeds of doubt and despair among our like-minded European allies. </P>
      <P>But having acknowledged this much does not imply an acceptance of 
      several lines of criticism. I can assure Peter Weiss that my values and 
      worldview did not shift in a matter of a couple of weeks but that the 
      nature of the challenge required a response that had some reasonable 
      prospect of being effective. We must start with the world as it is, not as 
      we would like it to be, although we should act to make our hopes and 
      dreams come true. The nonstate, multistate locus of this terrorist 
      adversary does not fit the existing structures of law and authority. In 
      dealing with warlike attacks on major countries, the UN is not entrusted 
      with either the capabilities or the mandate to fashion a response. 
      International society is still based on a self-help system as far as major 
      states are concerned, a fact acknowledged by the veto power given to the 
      permanent members of the Security Council. </P>
      <P>Where should we go from here? I agree very much with Mansour Farhang 
      that the removal of the Taliban is an independently beneficial goal, 
      especially for the Afghan people, and should have been stressed by the US 
      government. Ample justification for "humanitarian intervention" exists, 
      but its humanitarian character is lost if the means relied upon abandon 
      the constraints of law and morality and do not exhibit a credible 
      commitment to the protection of the Afghan people. Such a commitment 
      requires interveners to take casualty risks to the extent needed to avoid 
      killing large numbers of civilians and damaging their social 
      infrastructure. If the tactics contradict the mission, as now seems the 
      case in Afghanistan, the case for humanitarian intervention is undermined. 
      </P>
      <P>Is it "ludicrous," as Robert Merrill suggests, to label the September 
      11 attacks as "apocalyptic terrorism"? I think not. Some have tried other 
      labels to express their distinctiveness: Michael Ignatieff has referred to 
      "nihilistic terrorism" and others to "megaterrorism." I think 
      "apocalyptic" captures best the horizons of destructive violence and 
      purifying religious salvation that animate Osama bin Laden and his 
      followers. The point is to find language that distinguishes these attacks 
      from prior instances of terrorism associated with ongoing conflicts over 
      national self-determination. I have read the utterances of bin Laden, and 
      they express an unmistakable genocidal intention, backed up by fanatical 
      views and practices. The presence of US forces near Islam's holiest sites 
      may have pushed bin Laden over the edge, but the whole tenor of Al Qaeda, 
      its attitude toward the totality of "Crusaders," "Jews" and "Americans," 
      and its training programs and tactics suggests a commitment to 
      intercivilizational warfare. To understand such operations as preparing 
      the ground for negotiations I find implausible. Besides, it is not a 
      breach of any fundamental code for a government, as in Saudi Arabia, to 
      seek a foreign military presence to safeguard its security. We may not 
      like the regime in Riyadh, but it is playing by the international rules of 
      the game of world politics. </P>
      <P>We find ourselves trapped between a severe continuing threat to our 
      security and a government that is acting in such a way as to aggravate 
      that threat. At the same time, it is not obvious what can and should be 
      done. It is clear that the roots of terrorism are intermingled with unjust 
      policies, and that these should be abandoned as early as possible for both 
      pragmatic and intrinsic reasons. Pushing for a viable Palestinian state is 
      now finally surfacing on the Western agenda in an explicit manner. 
      Recognizing the need to address poverty, oppression and corruption in the 
      Islamic world is clearly essential if the underlying needs of human 
      security are to be satisfied. Even more ambitious, it should be part of 
      the progressive discourse to propose the sort of UN--and accompanying 
      arrangements like independent peacekeeping and enforcement capabilities, 
      an international criminal court and police force--that is needed to 
      overcome the deficiencies of a self-help system of world order that treats 
      war as the ultimate arbiter. To reach these results, however, will require 
      that the militarist political culture here at home be challenged and 
      transformed. These undertakings are urgent, but they cannot be undertaken 
      successfully in the midst of the atmosphere of fear and foreboding that 
      currently grips the vast majority of Americans, a mood accentuated by the 
      anthrax ordeal. </P>
      <P>Finally, the disorienting character of September 11 underscores the 
      relevance of discussion and debate. <I>The Nation</I> has been an 
      admirable forum for the expression of diverse views, and I hope that this 
      role will be maintained. I would also hope that all of us who take part 
      exhibit the realization that we would benefit from listening to those with 
      whom we disagree, and that no one has any plausible basis for certitude or 
      condescension.</P>
