                  <P><!-- If you see this comment there should be an image displayed with this section --><!-- Obj position=R--><BR>WE 
                  OUGHT TO FACE squarely the origins of the Palestinian descent 
                  into barbarism. In July 2000, Israeli prime minister Ehud 
                  Barak made a peace offer that stunned Israel and the world: 
                  Israel would re-divide Jerusalem--would turn over large pieces 
                  of its ancient capital to the same people who had destroyed 
                  its synagogues, desecrated its cemeteries, and banned Jews 
                  from entering when they last ran the show. Arafat rejected the 
                  offer. Then in September 2000 the new wave of murderous 
                  violence began, supposedly triggered by Ariel Sharon's visit 
                  to the Temple Mount. <BR><BR>In short, the Palestinian 
                  response to Israel's generous peace offer was, "Drop dead." 
                  How could that possibly have happened? A trick 
                  question--because the obvious but wrong answer is so close to 
                  the right one that it's hard to tune the right one in. You 
                  have to fiddle the dial back and forth. Yet the difference 
                  between the two is crucial. The "lesson of appeasement" is not 
                  that appeasement is futile. Appeasement is not futile, it is 
                  dangerous. Israel's enemies claim that Israel herself provoked 
                  the ongoing Palestinian pogrom, and in a sense they might well 
                  be right. Outlaws interpret an openhanded offer as weakness, 
                  not generosity. They interpret weakness as an incitement to 
                  violence. You can goad a dangerous animal to attack by 
                  threatening or by shrinking back. Unless you want to fight, 
                  the only safe maneuver is to stand still. <BR><BR>Everyone 
                  knows about Munich, September 1938: Britain and France 
                  generously donate a big slice of Czechoslovakia to Hitler, in 
                  exchange for "peace with honor," "peace in our time," and the 
                  Brooklyn Bridge. Many people know about the Kristallnacht 
                  pogrom, November 1938: Germany's approach to the Jews turns 
                  from mere oppression to bloodthirsty violence. Kristallnacht 
                  was "triggered" by the murder of a German diplomat by a 
                  deranged Jew. But some (not all) historians point out the 
                  obvious: A leading cause of Kristallnacht was Munich itself. 
                  Hitler read the Munich agreements as a proclamation by England 
                  and France stating: "We are weak; you have nothing to fear; do 
                  what you like." <BR><BR>The analogy is not close, just close 
                  enough. Israel is no Czechoslovakia and was not sold down the 
                  river. Barak made his offer freely and in good faith. But to a 
                  significant number of Palestinians, the offer obviously said: 
                  "We are weak; you have nothing to fear; attack." Appeasement 
                  doesn't merely fail to prevent catastrophe, it provokes 
                  catastrophe. <BR><BR>Now everything has changed, and we are 
                  only gradually coming to grips with the implications. 
                  Evidently the whole world is outraged by Israeli settlements 
                  on the West Bank. Even before the new violence, the world's 
                  outrage was hard to swallow. Some Israelis live among Arabs in 
                  settlements on the West Bank, some Arabs live among Jews in 
                  "settlements" (otherwise known as towns and cities) in Israel 
                  proper. What's the difference? The Israeli settlements are 
                  new, the Arab ones old. But if old settlements are legitimate 
                  and new ones aren't, what are all those mosques doing on the 
                  Temple Mount? Some European journalists refer to the great 
                  Temple Mount plaza as the "supposed" site of ancient Israel's 
                  holy temple--as in, "that beat-up white shell on the hill in 
                  mid-Athens is supposedly the 'Parthenon.'" The plaza was 
                  expanded to its current enormous size by King Herod of Judea 
                  during the final years of the last century B.C.E. During the 
                  peace talks two thousand years later, in July 2000, a 
                  Palestinian negotiator helpfully explained why Barak's offer 
                  of control but not legal sovereignty over the Mount had been 
                  rejected: "We can't sell our Haram to the Jews," even though 
                  (he forgot to add) they built it. (Arabs refer to the Temple 
                  Mount as the Haram.) <BR><BR>"New" and "old" depend on your 
                  point of view. Jews have as much right as anyone to settle on 
                  the West Bank. But it long seemed to me (as to many other 
                  American Jews) that, leaving right and wrong out of it, the 
                  settlements were causing Israel more grief than they were 
                  worth and ought to be stopped. But everything has changed. Who 
                  in his right mind could still believe today that to stop 
                  building new settlements (or even to abandon old ones) would 
                  appease the Palestinians? On the contrary: Such a move is 
                  likely to be dangerous, as Barak's offer turned out to be. 
                  <BR><BR>We now know what Palestinians want, and what they 
                  think of Israelis. After all, what exactly is the point of 
                  sending killers to massacre children at random? What do you 
                  accomplish? You impose hatred. You ask Israel, in effect: What 
                  do we need to do to make you all (not some of you; everyone) 
                  hate us? To make you unable to look at a Palestinian without 
                  revulsion? To force you eventually to take the terrible step 
                  of setting up enclaves where Arabs are banned? Palestinians 
                  don't want to live peaceably among Israelis; the natural 
                  conclusion is that they think about Israelis as they choose 
                  for Israelis to think about them. <BR><BR>Everything has 
                  changed, including (for many of us) our ideas about Islam. We 
                  ought to have paid more attention to the latest developments. 
                  We now learn that suicide bombers are told to expect a heaven 
                  full of comely virgins as their next assignment. To the 
                  suicide-murderers, those waiting virgins are real as dirt. The 
                  killers call themselves "martyrs," but in their own minds they 
                  are the next thing to sex criminals. "Pardon me, sir or madam, 
                  do you know why I plan to murder your child? Because the 
                  authorities are offering me great sex--and, after all, I don't 
                  get many opportunities." <BR><BR>People who think this way are 
                  shielded from view, up to a point, by their own sheer evil. 
                  They are painful to contemplate. We instinctively look away, 
                  as we do whenever we are confronted with monstrous deformity. 
                  Nothing is harder or more frightening to look at than a fellow 
                  human who is bent out of shape. And moral deformity is the 
                  most frightening kind by far. How can Muslims of good faith 
                  allow such people to call themselves Muslim? But they do allow 
                  it. What does that mean? And is it possible that we have 
                  located here, in this inspiring vision of heaven as a 
                  whorehouse, the most loathsome idea in the history of human 
                  thought? This is the civilization that condemns "licentious" 
                  America? <BR><BR>And what is Israel to do? Kill terrorists? 
                  Lock up incipient terrorists? Fine, but not enough. Develop 
                  the Palestinian opposition also. People who say there is none 
                  can't be serious. Among all those mothers and fathers of 
                  children who have become suicide-murderers, not one? Not one 
                  who believes: "The 'leaders' who did this to my child must be 
                  stopped"? Of course you don't dare say such things in the 
                  territories. But surely (one optimistically assures oneself), 
                  Israeli intelligence could locate a few such families if it 
                  tried, and if they were removed to safe ground and protected. 
                  . . ."Safe ground" couldn't be Israel or America, or the 
                  credibility of this new opposition would be fatally 
                  compromised. But it could be Europe. (Khomeini preached the 
                  Iranian revolution from France.) Those few families would be 
                  mere people, not "leaders," not politicians. But prospective 
                  leaders and politicians would come. Being (as a rule) without 
                  passion themselves, they are drawn by passion. The Palestinian 
                  leadership would try hard to silence these families and their 
                  followers, but the message would get through: Our barbaric 
                  leadership is destroying us. <BR><BR>But what of Europe? Not 
                  long ago I picked up a copy of Le Monde, which reports on the 
                  recent meeting where work was started on a constitution for 
                  Europe--the goal being to allow Europe to campaign, as the 
                  equal of any great power, "pour affirmer ses valeurs," to 
                  assert its values; and you can't help but wonder, exactly what 
                  "valeurs" are we talking about? Indifference? Complacency? 
                  Spiritual exhaustion? "European values" (certainly "French 
                  values") has come to sound like "Palestinian moderates"--a 
                  contradiction in terms. To any instance of Western 
                  man--American or not, Jew or gentile, male or female--Europe's 
                  spiritual collapse is heartbreaking. It is strange but true 
                  that the only European country one can picture (by the 
                  remotest stretch of the imagination) cooperating on the sly 
                  with Israel to help create a Palestinian opposition is 
                  Germany--or maybe, if the United States made an issue of it, 
                  Britain. <BR><BR><BR><BR>THERE ARE LARGER questions about 
                  Israel's role in the world that have been pressing for years, 
                  but nowadays seem to grow more acute by the hour. The axioms 
                  that underpinned Zionism have been turned inside out. Modern 
                  Israel was conceived as a safe haven for Jews. It had other 
                  reasons for existing--but safety, and the dignity that only 
                  comes with safety, were Zionism's emotional mainsprings. In 
                  recent decades, though, especially since the end of Soviet 
                  tyranny, the safe-haven idea has lost cogency like an unwound 
                  watch running down. In the last few years, Israel has started 
                  to look (on the contrary) like the most dangerous place for 
                  Jews in the world--if we exclude the small Jewish communities 
                  that still exist in Arab countries. Israel must change the way 
                  in which it explains itself. (Yoram Hazony made essentially 
                  this claim in his seminal "The Jewish State" of 2000.) 
                  <BR><BR>When we look at Israel today, it is crucial that we 
                  not allow Palestinian barbarism to distract us from another 
                  part of this picture: the everyday heroism that lights the 
                  whole place up from end to end. A large proportion of Israelis 
                  have relatives or connections abroad, mainly in the United 
                  States, and they could run to safety if they wanted to. Who 
                  would blame them? Who would even have the theoretical right to 
                  blame them? But overwhelmingly they have chosen to stay and 
                  stand fast. The whole population, man, woman, and child, is 
                  holding (is refusing to abandon) a dangerous forward position 
                  under fire. It's hard for Israelis to praise Israeli courage, 
                  but Americans ought to. <BR><BR>Why do they do it? Partly for 
                  powerful negative reasons. It isn't easy to leave home; and 
                  many Israelis are determined that Jews will never again be 
                  driven from their homes into alien lands by thug mobs. But 
                  there is more to Israel than resolve in the face of a uniquely 
                  tragic history. Israel still pays its way using the world's 
                  only emotional currency denominated entirely in negative 
                  numbers. It needs a new currency with positive markings. 
                  <BR><BR>Israeli thinkers ought to speak less about the tragedy 
                  (or the ordinariness) of Israel's 3,000-year history, and more 
                  about its luminous greatness; ought to talk up the nation's 
                  brilliant prospects, and the central role it has played from 
                  Moses to Wittgenstein in creating and molding Western 
                  civilization. They don't like to talk this way, but they ought 
                  to steel themselves and do it anyway. "The Jew is a desert 
                  region," Wittgenstein wrote, "but underneath its thin layer of 
                  rock lies the molten lava of spirit and intellect." Israeli 
                  thinkers have talked enough desert; it is time to talk lava. 
                  Much of the world is at a spiritual lowpoint right now, 
                  dragging its belly on the ground. Israel has known before what 
                  to do about that. Israel has addressed the whole world and 
                  wrought spiritual revolutions, and ought to do it again now.
