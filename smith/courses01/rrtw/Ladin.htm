<P>
<DIV class=body><!--being text--><B>... What is the meaning of your call for 
Muslims to take arms against America in particular, and what is the message that 
you wish to send to the West in general?</B>
<P>The call to wage war against America was made because America has 
spear-headed the crusade against the Islamic nation, sending tens of thousands 
of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and above its meddling in 
its affairs and its politics, and its support of the oppressive, corrupt and 
tyrannical regime that is in control. These are the reasons behind the singling 
out of America as a target. And not exempt of responsibility are those Western 
regimes whose presence in the region offers support to the American troops 
there. We know at least one reason behind the symbolic participation of the 
Western forces and that is to support the Jewish and Zionist plans for expansion 
of what is called the Great Israel. Surely, their presence is not out of concern 
over their interests in the region. ... Their presence has no meaning save one 
and that is to offer support to the Jews in Palestine who are in need of their 
Christian brothers to achieve full control over the Arab Peninsula which they 
intend to make an important part of the so called Greater Israel. ...<BR><IMG 
height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>Many of the Arabic as 
well as the Western mass media accuse you of terrorism and of supporting 
terrorism. What do you have to say to that?</B>
<P>There is an Arabic proverb that says "she accused me of having her malady, 
then snuck away." Besides, terrorism can be commendable and it can be 
reprehensible. Terrifying an innocent person and terrorizing him is 
objectionable and unjust, also unjustly terrorizing people is not right.<TR>

      hspace=0 src="Ladin_files/w1pq1a.gif" width=275 align=right vspace=15> 
      Whereas, terrorizing oppressors and criminals and thieves and robbers is 
      necessary for the safety of people and for the protection of their 
      property. There is no doubt in this. Every state and every civilization 
      and culture has to resort to terrorism under certain circumstances for the 
      purpose of abolishing tyranny and corruption. Every country in the world 
      has its own security system and its own security forces, its own police 
      and its own army. They are all designed to terrorize whoever even 
      contemplates to attack that country or its citizens. The terrorism we 
      practice is of the commendable kind for it is directed at the tyrants and 
      the aggressors and the enemies of Allah, the tyrants, the traitors who 
      commit acts of treason against their own countries and their own faith and 
      their own prophet and their own nation. Terrorizing those and punishing 
      them are necessary measures to straighten things and to make them right. 
      Tyrants and oppressors who subject the Arab nation to aggression ought to 
      be punished. The wrongs and the crimes committed against the Muslim nation 
      are far greater than can be covered by this interview. America heads the 
      list of aggressors against Muslims. The recurrence of aggression against 
      Muslims everywhere is proof enough. For over half a century, Muslims in 
      Palestine have been slaughtered and assaulted and robbed of their honor 
      and of their property. Their houses have been blasted, their crops 
      destroyed. And the strange thing is that any act on their part to avenge 
      themselves or to lift the injustice befalling them causes great agitation 
      in the United Nations which hastens to call for an emergency meeting only 
      to convict the victim and to censure the wronged and the tyrannized whose 
      children have been killed and whose crops have been destroyed and whose 
      farms have been pulverized. ...
      <P>In today's wars, there are no morals, and it is clear that mankind has 
      descended to the lowest degrees of decadence and oppression. They rip us 
      of our wealth and of our resources and of our oil. Our religion is under 
      attack. They kill and murder our brothers. They compromise our honor and 
      our dignity and dare we utter a single word of protest against the 
      injustice, we are called terrorists. This is compounded injustice. And the 
      United Nations insistence to convict the victims and support the 
      aggressors constitutes a serious precedence which shows the extent of 
      injustice that has been allowed to take root in this land. ...<BR><IMG 
      height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>What is your 
      relationship with the Islamic movements in various regions of the world 
      like Chechnya and Kashmir and other Arab countries? </B>
      <P>Cooperation for the sake of truth and righteousness is demanded from 
      Muslims. A Muslim should do his utmost to cooperate with his fellow 
      Muslims. But Allah says of cooperation that it is not absolute for there 
      is cooperation to do good, and there is cooperation to commit aggression 
      and act unjustly. A Muslim is supposed to give his fellow Muslim guidance 
      and support. He (Allah) said "Stand by your brother be he oppressor or 
      oppressed." When asked how were they to stand by him if he were the 
      oppressor, He answered them, saying "by giving him guidance and counsel." 
      It all goes to say that Muslims should cooperate with one another and 
      should be supportive of one another, and they should promote righteousness 
      and mercy. They should all unite in the fight against polytheism and they 
      should pool all their resources and their energy to fight the Americans 
      and the Zionists and those with them. They should, however, avoid side 
      fronts and rise over the small problems for these are less detrimental. 
      Their fight should be directed against unbelief and unbelievers. 
      ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>We 
      heard your message to the American government and later your message to 
      the European governments who participated in the occupation of the Gulf. 
      Is it possible for you to address the people of these countries?</B>
      <P>As we have already said, our call is the call of Islam that was 
      revealed to Mohammed. It is a call to all mankind. We have been entrusted 
      with good cause to follow in the footsteps of the Messenger and to 
      communicate his message to all nations. It is an invitation that we extend 
      to all the nations to embrace Islam, the religion that calls for justice, 
      mercy and fraternity among all nations, not differentiating between black 
      and white or between red and yellow except with respect to their 
      devotedness. All people who worship Allah, not each other, are equal 
      before Him. We are entrusted to spread this message and to extend that 
      call to all the people. We, nonetheless, fight against their governments 
      and all those who approve of the injustice they practice against us. We 
      fight the governments that are bent on attacking our religion and on 
      stealing our wealth and on hurting our feelings. And as I have mentioned 
      before, we fight them, and those who are part of their rule are judged in 
      the same manner. ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" 
      width=100><BR><B>In your last statement, there was a strong message to the 
      American government in particular. What message do you have for the 
      European governments and the West in general? </B>
      <P>Praise be Allah and prayers and peace upon Mohammed. With respect to 
      the Western governments that participated in the attack on the land of the 
      two Holy Mosques regarding it as ownerless, and in the siege against the 
      Muslim people of Iraq, we have nothing new to add to the previous message. 
      What prompted us to address the American government in particular is the 
      fact that it is on the head of the Western and the crusading forces in 
      their fight against Islam and against Muslims. The two explosions that 
      took place in Riyadh and in Khobar recently were but a clear and powerful 
      signal to the governments of the countries which willingly participated in 
      the aggression against our countries and our lives and our sacrosanct 
      symbols. It might be beneficial to mention that some of those countries 
      have begun to move towards independence from the American government with 
      respect to the enmity that it continues to show towards the Muslim people. 
      We only hope that they will continue to move in that direction, away from 
      the oppressive forces that are fighting against our countries. We however, 
      differentiate between the western government and the people of the West. 
      If the people have elected those governments in the latest elections, it 
      is because they have fallen prey to the Western media which portray things 
      contrary to what they really are. And while the slogans raised by those 
      regimes call for humanity, justice, and peace, the behavior of their 
      governments is completely the opposite. It is not enough for their people 
      to show pain when they see our children being killed in Israeli raids 
      launched by American planes, nor does this serve the purpose. What they 
      ought to do is change their governments which attack our countries. The 
      hostility that America continues to express against the Muslim people has 
      given rise to feelings of animosity on the part of Muslims against America 
      and against the West in general. Those feelings of animosity have produced 
      a change in the behavior of some crushed and subdued groups who, instead 
      of fighting the Americans inside the Muslim countries, went on to fight 
      them inside the United States of America itself. 
      <P>The Western regimes and the government of the United States of America 
      bear the blame for what might happen. If their people do not wish to be 
      harmed inside their very own countries, they should seek to elect 
      governments that are truly representative of them and that can protect 
      their interests. ...
      <P>The enmity between us and the Jews goes far back in time and is deep 
      rooted. There is no question that war between the two of us is inevitable. 
      For this reason it is not in the interest of Western governments to expose 
      the interests of their people to all kinds of retaliation for almost 
      nothing. It is hoped that people of those countries will initiate a 
      positive move and force their governments not to act on behalf of other 
      states and other sects. This is what we have to say and we pray to Allah 
      to preserve the nation of Islam and to help them drive their enemies out 
      of their land. <BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" 
      width=100><BR><B>American politicians have painted a distorted picture of 
      Islam, of Muslims and of Islamic fighters. We would like you to give us 
      the true picture that clarifies your viewpoint ... .</B>
      <P>The leaders in America and in other countries as well have fallen 
      victim to Jewish Zionist blackmail. They have mobilized their people 
      against Islam and against Muslims. These are portrayed in such a manner as 
      to drive people to rally against them. The truth is that the whole Muslim 
      world is the victim of international terrorism, engineered by America at 
      the United Nations. We are a nation whose sacred symbols have been looted 
      and whose wealth and resources have been plundered. It is normal for us to 
      react against the forces that invade our land and occupy it ... .<BR><IMG 
      height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>Quite a number of 
      Muslim countries have seen the rise of militant movements whose purpose is 
      to stand up in the face of the pressure exerted on the people by their own 
      governments and other governments. Such as is the case in Egypt and Libya 
      and North Africa and Algiers and such as was the case in Syria and in 
      Yemen. There are also other militant groups currently engaged in the fight 
      against the unbelievers and the crusaders as is the case in Kashmir and 
      Chechnya and Bosnia and the African horn. Is there any message you wish to 
      convey to our brothers who are fighting in various parts of the Islamic 
      World?</B>
      <P>... Tell the Muslims everywhere that the vanguards of the warriors who 
      are fighting the enemies of Islam belong to them and the young fighters 
      are their sons. Tell them that the nation is bent on fighting the enemies 
      of Islam. Once again, I have to stress the necessity of focusing on the 
      Americans and the Jews for they represent the spearhead with which the 
      members of our religion have been slaughtered. Any effort directed against 
      America and the Jews yields positive and direct results - Allah willing. 
      It is far better for anyone to kill a single American soldier than to 
      squander his efforts on other activities. ...<BR><IMG height=14

      <P><B><A class=no name=miller>You come from</A> a background of wealth and 
      comfort to end up fighting on the front lines. Many Americans find that 
      unusual. </B>
      <P>This is difficult to understand, especially for him who does not 
      understand the religion of Islam. In our religion, we believe that Allah 
      has created us for the purpose of worshipping him. He is the one who has 
      created us and who has favored us with this religion. Allah has ordered us 
      to make holy wars and to fight to see to it that His word is the highest 
      and the uppermost and that of the unbelievers the lowermost. We believe 
      that this is the call we have to answer regardless of our financial 
      capabilities. </P></TD>

      hspace=0 src="Ladin_files/w1pq2a.gif" width=275 align=right vspace=15>This 
      too answers the claims of the West and of the secular people in the Arab 
      world. They claim that this blessed awakening and the people reverting to 
      Islam are due to economic factors. This is not so. It is rather a grace 
      from Allah, a desire to embrace the religion of Allah. And this is not 
      surprising. When the holy war called, thousands of young men from the Arab 
      Peninsula and other countries answered the call and they came from wealthy 
      backgrounds. Hundreds of them were killed in Afghanistan and in Bosnia and 
      in Chechnya. <BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" 
      width=100><BR><B>You have been described as the world's most wanted man, 
      and there is word that the American government intends to put a price on 
      your head - in the millions - when you are captured. Do you think they 
      will do that? And does it bother you? </B>
      <P>We do not care what the Americans believe. What we care for is to 
      please Allah. Americans heap accusations on whoever stands for his 
      religion or his rights or his wealth. ... It does not scare us that they 
      have put a price on my head. We as Muslims believe that our years on this 
      earth are finite and predetermined. If the whole world gets together to 
      kill us before it is our time to go, they will not succeed. We also 
      believe that livelihoods are preordained. So no matter how much pressure 
      American puts on the regime in Riyadh to freeze our assets and to forbid 
      people from contributing to this great cause, we shall still have Allah to 
      take care of us; livelihood is sent by Allah; we shall not want. 
      ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>Mr. <A 
      class=no name=video>bin Laden</A>, you have issued a fatwah calling on 
      Muslims to kill Americans where they can, when they can. Is that directed 
      at all Americans, just the American military, just the Americans in Saudi 
      Arabia? </B>
      <P>Allah has ordered us to glorify the truth and to defend Muslim land, 
      especially the Arab peninsula ... against the unbelievers. After World War 
      II, the Americans grew more unfair and more oppressive towards people in 
      general and Muslims in particular. ... The Americans started it and 
      retaliation and punishment should be carried out following the principle 
      of reciprocity, especially when women and children are involved. Through 
      history, American has not been known to differentiate between the military 
      and the civilians or between men and women or adults and children. Those 
      who threw atomic bombs and used the weapons of mass destruction against 
      Nagasaki and Hiroshima were the Americans. Can the bombs differentiate 
      between military and women and infants and children? America has no 
      religion that can deter her from exterminating whole peoples. Your 
      position against Muslims in Palestine is despicable and disgraceful. 
      America has no shame. ... We believe that the worst thieves in the world 
      today and the worst terrorists are the Americans. Nothing could stop you 
      except perhaps retaliation in kind. We do not have to differentiate 
      between military or civilian. As far as we are concerned, they are all 
      targets, and this is what the fatwah says ... . The fatwah is general 
      (comprehensive) and it includes all those who participate in, or help the 
      Jewish occupiers in killing Muslims. <BR><IMG height=35 
      src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>Ramzi Yousef was a follower 
      of yours. Do you remember him and did you know him?</B>
      <P>After the explosion that took place in the World Trade Center, Ramzi 
      Yousef became a well known Muslim figure. Muslims have come to know him. 
      Unfortunately, I did not know him before this incident. I of course 
      remember who he is. He is a Muslim who wanted to protect his religion 
      jealously from the oppression practiced by America against Islam. He acted 
      with zeal to make the Americans understand that their government was 
      attacking Muslims in order to safeguard the American-Jewish interests. 
      ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>Wali 
      Khan Amin Shah was captured in Manila. American authorities believe he was 
      working for you, funded by you, setting up training camps there and part 
      of his plan was to plan out the assassination or the attempted 
      assassination of President Clinton during his trip to Manila. </B>
      <P>Wali Khan is a Muslim young man; his nickname in Afghanistan was the 
      Lion. He was among the most courageous Muslim young men. He was a close 
      friend and we used to fight from the same trenches in Afghanistan. We 
      fought many battles against the Russians until they were defeated and put 
      to shame and had to leave the country in disgrace. As to what you said 
      about him working for me, I have nothing to say. We are all together in 
      this; we all work for Allah and our reward comes from him. As to what you 
      said about the attempt to assassinate President Clinton, it is not 
      surprising. What do you expect from people attacked by Clinton, whose sons 
      and mothers have been killed by Clinton? Do you expect anything but 
      treatment by reciprocity? <BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif"

      government has thrown in jail in order to please the American government 
      for which they are agents. ... We have communicated their fatwahs and 
      stirred the nation to drive out the enemy who has occupied our land and 
      usurped our country and suppressed our people and to rid the land of the 
      two Holy Mosques from their presence. Among the young men who responded to 
      our call are Khalid Al Said and Abdul Azeez Al... and Mahmud Al Hadi and 
      Muslih Al Shamrani. We hope Allah receives them as holy martyrs. They have 
      raised the nation's head high and washed away a great part of the shame 
      that has enveloped us as a result of the weakness of the Saudi government 
      and its complicity with the American government ... . Yes, we have 
      instigated and they have responded. We hope Allah grants their families 
      solace. <BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" 
      width=100><BR><B>You've been painted in America as a terrorist leader. To 
      your followers, you are a hero. How do you see yourself? </B>
      <P>As I have said, we are not interested in what America says. We do not 
      care. We view ourselves and our brothers like everyone else. Allah created 
      us to worship Him and to follow in his footsteps and to be guided by His 
      Book. I am one of the servants of Allah and I obey his orders. Among those 
      is the order to fight for the word of Allah ... and to fight until the 
      Americans are driven out of all the Islamic countries. <BR><IMG height=35 
      src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>No one expected the 
      mujahedeen to beat the Russians in Afghanistan. It came as a surprise to 
      everyone. What do you see as the future of American involvement in the 
      Middle East, in taking on groups like this? </B>
      <P>... Allah has granted the Muslim people and the Afghani mujahedeen, and 
      those with them, the opportunity to fight the Russians and the Soviet 
      Union. ... They were defeated by Allah and were wiped out. There is a 
      lesson here. The Soviet Union entered Afghanistan late in December of '79. 
      The flag of the Soviet Union was folded once and for all on the 
      25<SUP>th</SUP> of December just 10 years later. It was thrown in the 
      waste basket. Gone was the Soviet union forever. We are certain that we 
      shall - with the grace of Allah - prevail over the Americans and over the 
      Jews, as the Messenger of Allah promised us in an authentic prophetic 
      tradition when He said the Hour of Resurrection shall not come before 
      Muslims fight Jews and before Jews hide behind trees and behind rocks. 
      <P>We are certain - with the grace of Allah - that we shall prevail over 
      the Jews and over those fighting with them. Today however, our battle 
      against the Americans is far greater than our battle was against the 
      Russians. Americans have committed unprecedented stupidity. They have 
      attacked Islam and its most significant sacrosanct symbols ... . We 
      anticipate a black future for America. Instead of remaining United States, 
      it shall end up separated states and shall have to carry the bodies of its 
      sons back to America. <BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" 
      width=100><BR><B>What do you see as the future of the Saudi royal family 
      and their involvement with America and the US military?</B>
      <P>History has the answer to your question. The fate of any government 
      which sells the interests of its own people and, betrays the nation and 
      commits offenses which furnish grounds for expulsion from Islam, is known. 
      We expect for the ruler of Riyadh the same fate as the Shah of Iran. We 
      anticipate this to happen to him and to the influential people who stand 
      by him and who have sided with the Jews and the Christians giving them 
      free reign over the land of the two Holy Mosques. These are grave offenses 
      that are grounds for expulsion from the faith. They shall all be wiped 
      out. ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" 
      width=100><BR><B>Describe the situation when your men took down the 
      American forces in Somalia.</B>
      <P>After our victory in Afghanistan and the defeat of the oppressors who 
      had killed millions of Muslims, the legend about the invincibility of the 
      superpowers vanished. Our boys no longer viewed America as a superpower. 
      So, when they left Afghanistan, they went to Somalia and prepared 
      themselves carefully for a long war. They had thought that the Americans 
      were like the Russians, so they trained and prepared. They were stunned 
      when they discovered how low was the morale of the American soldier. 
      America had entered with 30,000 soldiers in addition to thousands of 
      soldiers from different countries in the world. ... As I said, our boys 
      were shocked by the low morale of the American soldier and they realized 
      that the American soldier was just a paper tiger. He was unable to endure 
      the strikes that were dealt to his army, so he fled, and America had to 
      stop all its bragging and all that noise it was making in the press after 
      the Gulf War in which it destroyed the infrastructure and the milk and 
      dairy industry that was vital for the infants and the children and the 
      civilians and blew up dams which were necessary for the crops people grew 
      to feed their families. Proud of this destruction, America assumed the 
      titles of world leader and master of the new world order. After a few 
      blows, it forgot all about those titles and rushed out of Somalia in shame 
      and disgrace, dragging the bodies of its soldiers. America stopped calling 
      itself world leader and master of the new world order, and its politicians 
      realized that those titles were too big for them and that they were 
      unworthy of them. I was in Sudan when this happened. I was very happy to 
      learn of that great defeat that America suffered, so was every Muslim. 
      ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>Many 
      Americans believe that fighting army to army like what happened in 
      Afghanistan is heroic for either army. But sending off bombs, killing 
      civilians like in the World Trade Center is terrorism. </B>
      <P>... After our victory over the Russians in Afghanistan, the 
      international and the American mass media conducted fierce campaigns 
      against us ... . They called us terrorists even before the mujahedeen had 
      committed any act of terrorism against the real terrorists who are the 
      Americans. On the other hand, we say that American politics and their 
      religion do not believe in differentiating between civilians and military, 
      between infants and animals, or among any human groups. ...
      <P>Our mothers and daughters and sons are slaughtered every day with the 
      approval of America and its support. And, while America blocks the entry 
      of weapons into Islamic countries, it provides the Israelis with a 
      continuous supply of arms allowing them thus to kill and massacre more 
      Muslims. Your religion does not forbid you from committing such acts, so 
      you have no right to object to any response or retaliation that 
      reciprocates your own actions. But, and in spite of this, our retaliation 
      is directed primarily against the soldiers only and against those standing 
      by them. Our religion forbids us from killing innocent people such as 
      women and children. This, however, does not apply to women fighters. A 
      woman who puts herself in the same trench with men, gets what they get. 
      ...<BR><IMG height=35 src="Ladin_files/blank.gif" width=100><BR><B>The 
      American people, by and large, do not know the name bin Laden, but they 
      soon likely will. Do you have a message for the American people?</B>
      <P>I say to them that they have put themselves at the mercy of a disloyal 
      government, and this is most evident in Clinton's administration ... . We 
      believe that this administration represents Israel inside America. Take 
      the sensitive ministries such as the Ministry of Exterior and the Ministry 
      of Defense and the CIA, you will find that the Jews have the upper hand in 
      them. They make use of America to further their plans for the world, 
      especially the Islamic world. American presence in the Gulf provides 
      support to the Jews and protects their rear. And while millions of 
      Americans are homeless and destitute and live in abject poverty, their 
      government is busy occupying our land and building new settlements and 
      helping Israel build new settlements in the point of departure for our 
      Prophet's midnight journey to the seven heavens. America throws her own 
      sons in the land of the two Holy Mosques for the sake of protecting Jewish 
      interests. ...
      <P>The American government is leading the country towards hell. ... We say 
      to the Americans as people and to American mothers, if they cherish their 
      lives and if they cherish their sons, they must elect an American 
      patriotic government that caters to their interests not the interests of 
      the Jews. If the present injustice continues with the wave of national 
      consciousness, it will inevitably move the battle to American soil, just 
      as Ramzi Yousef and others have done. This is my message to the American 
      people. I urge them to find a serious administration that acts in their 
      interest and does not attack people and violate their honor and pilfer 
      their wealth. ...
      <P><B>In America, we have a figure from history from 1897 named Teddy 
      Roosevelt. He was a wealthy man, who grew up in a privileged situation and 
      who fought on the front lines. He put together his own men - hand chose 
      them - and went to battle. You are like the Middle East version of Teddy 
      Roosevelt.</B>
      <P>I am one of the servants of Allah. We do our duty of fighting for the 
      sake of the religion of Allah. It is also our duty to send a call to all 
      the people of the world to enjoy this great light and to embrace Islam and 
      experience the happiness in Islam. Our primary mission is nothing but the 
      furthering of this religion. ... Let not the West be taken in by those who 
      say that Muslims choose nothing but slaughtering. Their brothers in East 
      Europe, in Turkey and in Albania have been guided by Allah to submit to 
      Islam and to experience the bliss of Islam. Unlike those, the European and 
      the American people and some of the Arabs are under the influence of 
      Jewish media. ...</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><!--end text--></P></DIV><BR
