      <P class=ArticleText>Bernard Lewis, professor emeritus at Princeton 
      University, is considered by most of his colleagues as the greatest 
      historian of the Muslim world in our generation. He is Jewish, a native of 
      London, in his 80s. Among his many students are teachers and analysts who 
      work in universities in Israel and the Arab countries. His age hardly 
      shows: he moves easily, exhibits an ironic sense of humor, clearly 
      conscious of his importance. He travels a great deal. He frequently visits 
      Israel as a guest of Tel Aviv University, and he sometimes visits the 
      neighboring countries too, but he understandably refuses to talk about 
      that. Government leaders frequently consult with him and he has been in 
      great demand during the past year. The breadth of his knowledge and his 
      decisive views are aimed to assist the ones in power in the West to shape 
      their policy towards the Muslim world.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText>"The Patriarch of the Islamicists", as he is called 
      in the American press, stands out as a partisan of classic liberal values. 
      He is often attacked because he refuses to comply with the spirit of the 
      times, in which the voice of relativism is strong, which is cautious about 
      judging cultures from the point of view of western culture. In his 
      best-known debate, he faced Edward Said, the well-known Palestinian 
      professor of literature, in whose book "Orientalism" he condemns Lewis and 
      scholars like him. He charges that their studies are another means which 
      the West uses to strengthen its imperialistic rule.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText>One may assume that the following interview will 
      harden his opponents and hearten perplexed Israelis. Ariel Sharon can find 
      in his words encouragement for his position on the need for complete 
      victory before any gesture.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>YOU PEGGED YOUR HOPE ON THE OSLO PROCESS.</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>That would be correct.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>WERE YOU PROVED WRONG?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>To my great regret, I must confess I made a 
      mistake.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>WHAT DID THE ERROR IN YOUR ASSESSMENT STEM 
      FROM?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Historically, the Palestinian leaders have 
      consistently made the wrong choice. It started with their refusing the 
      terms of the Peel Commission and their rejection of the UN Partition Plan. 
      They made mistakes in their choice of friends: during the Second World War 
      they chose the Nazis, during the Cold War they chose the Soviet Bloc and 
      in the Gulf War they joined with Saddam Hussein. Do they have an 
      astonishing instinct that pushes them to the verge of destruction? Indeed 
      not. They turned to the enemies of their enemies and this is natural. 
      After the collapse of the Soviet Bloc, they once again had no super power 
      patron, and after the Gulf War, even most of the Arab governments were 
      disgusted with them, particularly those that could offer them financial 
      aid. Under these circumstances, I thought the Rabin government was correct 
      in moving as it did, but it erred in its choice of its partner for the 
      process."</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>ARAFAT?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Yes, the idea of bringing Arafat from Tunis was a 
      mistake.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>ISRAEL TRIED TO TALK WITH THE PALESTINIAN LEADERS 
      IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, BUT AT THE MADRID CONFERENCE IT WAS PROVEN 
      THAT THEY HAVE NO LEADER BESIDES HIM.</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>It's true that according to the resolution of the 
      Arab League, the PLO is the Palestinians' only representative 
      organization. From this distance in time it is hard for me to judge if it 
      would have been better to insist on finding an alternative to it, or 
      perhaps there was no other choice.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>IN AN INTERVIEW YOU SAID THAT THE ONES WHO 
      CONDUCTED THE NEGOTIATIONS ON BOTH SIDES WERE COMPLETE AMATEURS. WHAT DID 
      YOU MEAN?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>It's clear they were not professional diplomats and 
      they did not have much experience in conducting negotiations.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>WHAT WAS THE BIG MISTAKE OF THE NEGOTIATORS AT 
      CAMP DAVID?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>They forgot that is not just a matter of negotiations 
      between leaders, but between two differing civilizations. It is easy to 
      slip and interpret your adversary according to your worldview. I will give 
      you an example. I think that Israel was right to enter Lebanon, and I well 
      remember how its army was received as an army of liberation, with flowers 
      and music, but from the moment the job was completed, it was necessary to 
      withdraw from there. The late withdrawal, as it was undertaken without 
      agreement, with abandonment of friends and weaponry, was interpreted by 
      the Palestinians and the other Arabs as a sign of weakness. From the 
      experience of Hizbullah they derived that the Israelis are soft, pampered, 
      and if they are hit -- they will surrender. These things have been said 
      explicitly by the Palestinians.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>DO THE TWO CULTURES INTERPRET DIFFERENTLY THE 
      CONCEPTS OF "FAIR COMPROMISE" AND "VIEWING REALITY OUT OF A CONSIDERATION 
      FOR THE ENEMY'S POINT OF VIEW?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Let me be precise: Muslim culture stands out in the 
      generosity of its victors. The victor does not push the face of the 
      vanquished in the dust, but the result of the struggle has to be clear to 
      both sides. A struggle that ends indecisively is an invitation for 
      trouble. The Ottomans provided us with many examples of this conduct: they 
      crushed rebels with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, but did not 
      humiliate the defeated, they showed generosity toward them and even helped 
      them rehabilitate themselves. If the one with the power does not exhaust 
      his ability to bring about such a victory, his conduct is interpreted as 
      cowardice.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Another example of differing interpretations of 
      conduct is the is significance of manners and customs: I visited Jordan 
      some time after the signing of the peace agreement on which the Jordanians 
      bed much hope, and I found the Jordanians agitated over the conduct of the 
      Israeli tourists which they saw as provocative and humiliating. It was 
      difficult for me to explain to them that Israelis behave that way even to 
      each other. The Israelis, who seem to be the least polite people in the 
      world, are not understood by the Arabs, who have the most well-mannered 
      culture in the world. It is not a matter of insignificant etiquette, but 
      of conduct that has a bearing on relations between the peoples. The lack 
      of courtesy of the Israeli solders at the checkpoints has terrible 
      repercussions and something needs to be done about this matter.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>DON'T YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO OVERSTATE THE CLASH 
      OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CULTURES?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>There is tremendous importance in these differences. 
      Look, the Christian world and the Muslim world had friction with each 
      other and fought against each other on many fronts during the course of a 
      millennium. At the end of the 18th century the universities in the west 
      had dozens of departments for eastern studies and hundreds of translations 
      of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish works were printed. The western world 
      longed to know its historic adversary, but a share in this curiosity was 
      not given to the Muslim world. There they did not learn the languages of 
      the West, didn't take an interest in western history and thought and did 
      not translate much literature into Arabic. Things changed somewhat when 
      the power of the threat of the west became clear to them, but even now, if 
      you go into a book store in Israel, you will easily find translations from 
      Arabic literature and books about Arab and Muslim history. In contrast, if 
      you go into a bookstore in an Arab capital and look for books on Israel, 
      on Judaism and even on Christianity, practically all you will find is 
      propaganda. Curiosity about one's fellow is a striking western phenomenon. 
      In all the great cultures, except western culture, the matter of one's 
      fellow arises only in the presence of a threat."</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>IS THIS SITUATION REGARDING CULTURES PERMANENT, OR 
      A RESULT OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>It is definitely not permanent, but it is deeply 
      rooted, more than many people like to think. For example, many point to 
      the fact that only 2 of the 57 Muslim countries have semi democratic 
      governments, but this does not say that Muslims lack the ability to 
      develop their own version of democracy, that will not resemble any western 
      democracy.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>WHICH TWO COUNTRIES DO YOU MEAN?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Turkey and Bangladesh. Turkey is a wonderful example, 
      which proves that it is very difficult to establish a liberal democracy in 
      a culture with an ancient autocratic tradition, but it also proves that it 
      is not impossible.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>THE OUTBREAK OF THE SECOND INTIFADA HAS BEEN 
      INTERPRETED BY MANY ISRAELIS, PERHAPS A MAJORITY, AS DECISIVE EVIDENCE 
      THAT THE PALESTINIANS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN A COMPROMISE, BUT ARE DRIVING 
      TOWARDS A COMPLETE VICTORY. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE INTIFADA?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>I already told you that the withdrawal from Lebanon 
      had a great influence on the decision of the Palestinians to renew the 
      armed struggle. Israel is depicted as a country that resembles America and 
      the Americans, who fled from Vietnam and extracted themselves suddenly 
      from Lebanon and Somalia, proved by this conduct that they are pampered 
      and not adapted to absorb losses. Likewise the Israelis, who became rich 
      and got soft and pampered themselves. America and Israel are close friends 
      and the Palestinians took a page from the conduct of America in analyzing 
      the expected conduct of Israel.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>A FEW YEARS AGO YOU PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE WHICH HAD 
      GREAT RESONANCE: "THE ROOTS OF MUSLIM RAGE". WOULD YOU AGREE TO 
      ENCAPSULATE THE BASIC IDEAS IN THE ARTICLE AND UPDATE THEM IN LIGHT OF 
      WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE IT WAS PUBLISHED.</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>In the whole Muslim world in our day a feeling of 
      frustration and crisis prevails. Everything is mixed up. For more than a 
      thousand years the Muslims became accustomed to the belief, justified in 
      its time, that they represented the most advanced part of the world, and 
      that they are the ones who set the standards in politics, economics and 
      science. In the new age the Muslims came to realize that their power had 
      weakened and that even adopting western technology wasn't any help. The 
      western ideas of socialism and capitalism did not halt the economic 
      deterioration, and then the belief arose that redemption was to be found 
      in adopting the western democratic brand of government. Most unfortunately 
      it was proven that the only western brand that succeeded in taking root in 
      the Muslim world was dictatorship, based on a single party. Political 
      independence did not give rise to freedom. The reaction to these 
      disappointments is resistance to any ideas imported from the west and 
      blaming the west for all the unhealthy evils that stemmed from the failed 
      attempt to imitate its culture.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Now there are two options: some feel that the failure 
      stems from abandonment of the earlier traditions, leaving behind the 
      authentic Islamic culture. The two main versions that have stemmed from 
      this feeling are Wahabi Fundamentalism which is disseminated by the 
      Saudis, and the Iranian-Shiite Fundamentalism. The other option, which 
      adherents to the modern hold, says that the failure stems from the Muslims 
      having adopted the shell of western culture and not its deep content, and 
      therefore it is necessary to introduce western values in their full depth. 
      In all of the Muslim world there are people who think that way, but the 
      dictatorships make it difficult for them to express their opinions 
      openly.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>IS OSAMA BIN LADEN THE EXTREME EXPRESSION OF THE 
      FIRST OPTION?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Of course. But here one must stress the importance of 
      Arab oil. The tremendous profits that the Saudis accumulated have enabled 
      them to develop a network of schools with many branches that cultivates 
      Wahabi Fundamentalism. It is possible that if not for the oil, this 
      movement would have remained an otherworldly phenomenon in a marginal 
      country. In general, the oil is the Arabs' disaster, because it enabled 
      governments to accumulate enormous wealth which strengthens their 
      political and military power and destroys democracy and freedom in the 
      bud. It is no accident that the only countries in which the beginnings of 
      a civilian society are growing are Morocco and Jordan which have no 
      oil.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>IS AMERICA HATED IN THE MUSLIM WORLD BECAUSE IT 
      SUPPORTS ISRAEL, OR IS ISRAEL HATED BECAUSE IT IS PERCEIVED AS A FORWARD 
      STRONGHOLD OF THE WEST IN THE MUSLIM WORLD?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>Both. Of course, the bond with Israel does not help 
      America's popularity, but the Mideast is not the only place in the world 
      in which they loathe this large wealthy empire. It is hated because it is 
      so successful and local figures exploit the resentment for their special 
      needs. For example, for Bin Laden the main problem is his country, Saudi 
      Arabia, which he wants to rid of the presence of infidels. He mentions 
      Israel, if at all, in the third place on his list of targets. In one of 
      his speeches he called it "a lowly little country", in other words not 
      something substantial or very important and in an interview he gave some 
      years ago he said that if the Americans leave Saudi Arabia he would be 
      prepared to sign a peace agreement. Israel is an easy target for 
      propagandists in the Arab world because attacking it does not endanger 
      them, while in some Arab countries they are looking for trouble if they 
      disseminate attacks against America. The propagandists know that in 
      America and Europe there is a willing ear for anti-Israel propaganda and 
      the reason is that directing an assault against Israel eases the burden of 
      the accusations that are spread on them in the west. This is where the 
      aggression towards Israel in the Sabra and Shatila affair comes from, as 
      compared with the leniency towards the deeds of Hafez Assad in the city of 
      Hama, or towards the chemical weapons attack on the Kurds in Halbaja.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>WHAT ARE THE LONG RANGE RESULTS OF THE WAR IN 
      AFGHANISTAN?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>People in the West are accustomed to ask "why don't 
      they like us" and the simple answer is that you can't be wealthy, strong 
      and successful and be liked, especially considering that for a few hundred 
      years you have won every battle. The correct question is: "why have they 
      stopped respecting you, or at least fearing you?" I mentioned earlier that 
      men like Bin Laden believed that the west was pampered and soft. I hope 
      that the war in Afghanistan changed this perception, because it proves 
      that the idea that America and the other western countries are soft is an 
      invention, and that they are afraid to fight when their civilization is 
      attacked. Now there are two possibilities: either the people in the Muslim 
      world, and particularly the Arabs, decide that in order to establish a 
      better society it is necessary to turn to the path of peace and 
      cooperation with the west, or they will believe that the defeat in 
      Afghanistan was a painful episode but they need to continue in the same 
      path. I hope that the first way will win, but I can't exclude the 
      possibility that the second idea will take hold.</P>
      <P class=ArticleText><B>ISRAEL SEES IRAN AS A GREAT MILITARY DANGER. ARE 
      CHANGES HAPPENING IN IT THAT COULD EASE OUR MINDS?</B></P>
      <P class=ArticleText>The Iranian politicians who are depicted as 
      moderates, are nothing but makeup whose purpose is to enable the regime to 
      continue acting as it wants, but many signs indicate that the regime has 
      become very unpopular, and will be thrown out if an opportunity presents 
      itself. Here I want to mention a paradox: the masses in countries that 
      declare their opposition to America love America, while the masses in 
      countries whose governments support America, exhibit resentment towards 
      America. It is no accident that the terrorists who attacked the twin 
      towers and the Pentagon indeed came from Egypt and Saudi Arabia while in 
      Tehran there were large spontaneous, authentic demonstrations, in which 
      people expressed sorrow. It is clear that the hatred for America in Egypt 
      and Saudi Arabia stems, first and foremost, from the hatred for the 
      corrupt regimes there. The demonstrations for joy in Kabul will seem like 
      funeral processions compared to the demonstrations for joy that will break 
      out in Baghdad, Tehran and perhaps even Damascus, if the west brought 
      about the expulsion of the despotic inefficient regimes that rule in these 
      countries.</P>

      2/1/2002<BR><B>Encourages further serious examination</B><BR>Thank you for 
      publishing this excellent article. Professor Lewis is such a serious 
      thinker that I can enjoy reading even those of his thoughts with which I 
      disagree. <BR><BR>For example, Professor Lewis seems to attribute to 
      politics the Palestinian leaders’ habit of making wrong choices – “They 
      turned to the enemies of their enemies and this is natural.” <BR><BR>But 
      “natural” isn’t necessarily right or moral. Joining with gross barbarians 
      like Hitler and Saddam Hussein goes far beyond “making a mistake”. We are 
      endowed by our Creator with the ability to distinguish between right and 
      wrong, and to the extent that we choose wrong, we yield to the evil and 
      unholy forces of barbarianism. The question that I am exploring is whether 
      the Palestinian leaders make immoral choices because they are immoral 
      individuals intentionally allying themselves with evil supporters, or – 
      not entirely alternatively – the Islamicism that bred them is a barbarian 
      culture. <BR>
      <P><B>themelvin@aol.com</B>, 1/29/2002<BR><B>thank you</B><BR>I liked 
      theobjectitivity depth and self criticality of this article. t 
      corroborates what the refuseniks (soldier in the settlements) charge 
      essentially escalatory precipitous rudeness. Coming from this site I 
      believe its valid. It takes 2 sides to make a conflict.I prefer prof Lewis 
      to one sided polemics. There are great rewards I feel by relating 
      empathically as Martin Buber said in I- thou, not I-it. oNE OF OUR GREAT 
      RABBIS SAID the whole torah = what is haeful to us don't do to others
      <P>Anonymous, 1/28/2002<BR><B>very informative</B><BR>as in any fight, the 
      path to victory is knowing your adversary
