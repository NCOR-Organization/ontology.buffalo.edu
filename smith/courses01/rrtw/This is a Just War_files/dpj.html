      terrorist attack on the United States in September will have grave 
      repercussions over the whole world for years to come. The purpose behind 
      the attack was to separate America and its allies from everyone else, and 
      the Muslim world in particular. For the past decade or so, Muslim 
      extremists have been on the march, fighting neighbors of other religions 
      wherever they find them: Hindus in Kashmir, Jews in Israel, Orthodox 
      Russians in Chechnya, animists and Christians in Africa. In the 
      perspective of the suicide bombers, Americans are Westerners but also 
      Christians, therefore the principal legitimate objects of holy war. These 
      Muslim extremists have been trying to open their version of an ideological 
      and armed struggle with global implications: Muslims and as much of the 
      Third World as possible versus democracy. This ambition is now out in the 
      open. 
      <P class=ind>Put in familiar European terms, this attack is the equivalent 
      of the German occupation of the Rhineland in 1936. The failure of Britain 
      and France to rise to that occasion led Hitler to the conclusion that no 
      matter how aggressive he was the democracies would always prefer 
      appeasement to war. A similar failure now to rise to the occasion will 
      place every democratic country in jeopardy. All manner of changes in 
      attitudes towards security, asylum, and human rights have to be envisaged 
      as the open society takes measures to defend itself. 
      <P class=ind>The democracies are not on their own in the coming struggle, 
      but time and intelligence are needed in order to prepare for what lies 
      ahead. The Muslim world does not present a unified bloc. On the contrary, 
      it is split by sectarian and ethnic disputes as well as by internal power 
      struggles. The extremists represent a small—though no doubt 
      growing—minority. Destroying everything before them, they have already 
      provoked civil war in Algeria, Sudan, and Afghanistan, and they have 
      destabilized Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the Palestine Authority, and 
      not least Pakistan. The response of these countries&rsquo; respective leaders is 
      critical to American success. 
      <P class=ind>The terrorist attack on America serves as a last-minute 
      warning to moderate Muslim leaders to mend their ways and join the 
      extremists. Backed into such a corner, the Pakistani President Musharraf 
      has instead dropped the Taliban and sided outright with America. Egypt, 
      far and away the most influential Arab country, is dancing on a tightrope 
      because it too has long been under continuous threat from its extremists. 
      Muammar Qaddafi in Libya and General Omar Bashir in Sudan have similarly 
      decided that they have more to fear from their extremists than from the 
      United States. About a dozen terror groups have bases in or around 
      Damascus, but the young president Bashar Assad may not necessarily protect 
      them. In one of the customary internal power struggles of the Muslim 
      world, Iran is suspicious of the Taliban, and for the first time in years 
      at least some of its leaders are not preaching &ldquo;Death to America&rdquo; in the 
      mosques. A wise America will hold a heavy stick behind its back and in its 
      hand as enticing a bunch of carrots as possible, including remission of 
      debt, trade advantages, and political support against extremists. This is, 
      essentially, a hearts and minds operation. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>A</FONT> fantasy is loose in the world, the fantasy of an 
      Islamic supremacy that is destined to triumph everywhere. Some of its 
      advocates claim that eventually Christian countries will become Muslim, in 
      what would amount to a reverse colonialism. Like Communism before it, this 
      Islamic extremism aims to impose its vision on others and call it 
      universal peace. Here, in an unexpected form, is another totalitarian 
      movement. Like all such movements, it does not hesitate to use violence. 
      True believers in each and every totalitarianism always take their stand 
      on the specious and murderous grounds that the ends justify the means. 
      <P class=ind>The huge majority of Muslims understand only too clearly that 
      the extremists do not speak in their name but are likely to unleash 
      Armageddon on all, and they view this with horror. The escape of so many 
      millions of refugees from Afghanistan, for instance, is a public vote of 
      no-confidence in the Taliban. For some, even unknown Nauru— the world&rsquo;s 
      smallest independant republic— is evidently preferable to home. Untold 
      millions of Muslims long to emigrate to the West, whose freedom and 
      prosperity are the stuff of their dreams. 
      <P class=ind>Needless to say, this Islamic fantasy has nothing to do with 
      Islam proper, a religion like all other great religions, with a genuine 
      vision of justice and equality at its core. Indeed, the damage that the 
      Islamic triumphalist fantasy does to Islam as well as Muslim countries and 
      peoples is at least as severe and dangerous as the damage it does to 
      democracy. The same was true about other totalitarianisms: Nazism utterly 
      ruined Germany, Communism utterly ruined Russia. 
      <P class=ind>To judge by their reported conduct, the recent suicide 
      bombers were living in an atmosphere that had nothing to do with Islam. 
      According to Islamic teaching, whoever commits suicide is condemned to 
      hell. Their central purpose, then, was contrary to their religion. They 
      had shaved off their beards, they spent time in bars, they became drunk, 
      they frequented strip clubs. They carried rolls of hundred dollar bills 
      and spent them ostentatiously. We may suppose that at some level, 
      consciously or unconsciously, they were enjoying the America they were 
      planning to destroy. For it is here, in a most complex relationship of 
      attraction and repulsion, that we must begin to understand the motivations 
      of the terrorists, and so frame our responses. 
      <P class=ind>Each man kills the thing he loves, in the famous words of 
      Oscar Wilde. Premeditated killing of unknown people in an act that 
      simultaneously kills oneself requires a life-denying hate so exceptional 
      that it is in a realm of fanaticism all its own. Such hate signifies a 
      total human failure. This corresponds to the turmoil of the Muslim world 
      today. Each and every Muslim country faces intractable problems of 
      demography, lack of resources and skills, ethnic and religious strife, and 
      selfish government; each and every Muslim suffers from this jumble of 
      assorted ills. 
      <P class=ind>As if that were not enough, Muslim extremists and even some 
      moderates have come to believe that everything wrong with their world is 
      the fault of the Jews. This is partly a relic from the tribal past, and 
      partly another mistaken interpretation of the present. They think in a 
      sort of syllogism. Jews are wicked by definition. America helps Jews. 
      Therefore America is wicked. And yet another false syllogism: Saddam 
      Hussein is an Arab, America wishes to remove Saddam Hussein, therefore 
      America persecutes Arabs. Years will have to pass before the extremists 
      grasp that the humane and democratic values that unite Israel and America 
      serve no conspiratorial anti-Islamic purposes. But that is the context in 
      which America must now operate. 
      <P class=ind>The causes of today&rsquo;s turmoil go deep into the roots of 
      history. The major intellectual developments of the West—the Renaissance 
      with its concept of humanism and the Age of Enlightenment during which 
      scientific principles by and large replaced religious dogma—passed the 
      Muslim world by. Muslims everywhere were in the grip of the absolute 
      system of one-man despotism that they had inherited from their forebears 
      and that they believed protected their religion and identity. Western 
      energy and creativity of which they were unaware duly overwhelmed them, 
      and they could do nothing about it. There were Muslim rulers who resisted, 
      and their names have entered Muslim and Western lore alike: Emir Abdel 
      Kader in Algeria, Shamyl in the Caucasus, the Mahdi with his Sudanese 
      dervishes, the so-called Mad Mullah of Berbera. 
      <P class=ind>A nineteenth-century Muslim philosopher, Jamal al-Din 
      al-Afghani, spoke for all such. He did not hesitate to stigmatize Muslims 
      as backward. He swung between extreme self-pity about their common plight 
      and ferocious insistence that the remedy lay in violence. Putting his 
      finger on what he thought was the crux of the matter, he wrote, &ldquo;It is 
      amazing that it was precisely the Christians who invented Krupp&rsquo;s cannons 
      and the machine gun before the Muslims.&rdquo; The analysis was false; stemming 
      from science, improved weaponry carried no religious connotation. But 
      al-Afghani succeeded in imprinting throughout the Muslim world a sense of 
      inferiority to the West. The Muslim masses, otherwise proud people, came 
      to see the West as an entity deliberately out to shame and humiliate them. 
      Today&rsquo;s Islamic fantasy springs from this mindset in which self-pity and 
      revenge go hand in hand. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>wo alternatives were open to Muslims in practice. 
      One was to retreat into the fortress of Muslim identity and reject the 
      West. Numberless groups and organizations have chosen that course, from 
      the Muslim Brotherhood to Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Hizballah today, as 
      well as the Taliban and their proxy, Osama bin Laden. They see themselves 
      engaged in a war on two fronts, against the West and against opponents who 
      are fellow Muslims. They live out the triumphalist fantasy. 
      <P class=ind>The other alternative was to seek to discover the source of 
      European energy and mastery. In every colonized Muslim country leaders 
      believed that nationalism was the great western secret, and accordingly 
      they formed nationalist movements, and ultimately nationalist states. 
      Islamic extremists and nationalists shared a common need to acquire 
      European weapons. Either way, in order for Muslims to recover their pride, 
      a test of strength with the Europeans was built into the future. 
      <P class=ind>After the Second World War, the colonial powers no longer had 
      interests in the Middle East that they deemed worth a real test of 
      strength, and they retreated. The encounter so far between Muslims and the 
      West had been a profound movement of history with pluses and minuses for 
      both sides. But at least the end of colonialism seemed to absolve Muslims, 
      and in particular Arabs, from the sense of shame tormenting them. 
      <P class=ind>For fifty years and more, the Muslim world has been 
      independent, free to organize as it wishes, and, moreover, several Muslim 
      countries are beneficiaries of a petrodollar bonanza, which they can 
      dispose of for any end they like. Throughout this period Muslim and Arab 
      rulers have plumped for the outward signs of Western life, such as 
      high-rise buildings, hospitals, and colleges. They have imported modernity 
      as though it were a commodity like any other. But once again, in an 
      incomplete and misleading analysis of the position, they did not recognize 
      that the true source of Western strength lay in a democratic political 
      system that liberated people&rsquo;s energies and had nothing to do with 
      nationalism. 
      <P class=ind>Instead, the leaders of nationalist movements lost no time in 
      promoting themselves absolute one-man rulers of their own countries. Gamal 
      Abdel Nasser in Egypt was the model for them all. The result has been a 
      present-day mimicry of the historic despotisms of the past. Nothing like 
      democracy exists in the Muslim world, where Turkey alone has ever 
      experienced a change of government through a free and unrigged election, 
      and there only once. Parliaments exist to rubberstamp the ruler&rsquo;s decrees. 
      There is no freedom of speech or of assembly, no civil rights, but only 
      the dreaded secret police, prisons, torture, and execution. The injustice 
      is flagrant. Corruption is everywhere. Excluded from any say, the masses 
      still have no control over their destiny, but they are able to protest 
      only through a riot. Power changes hands by assassination or coup. In the 
      absence of mechanisms for power-sharing and mediation, every national and 
      international conflict of interest degenerates into a test of strength. 
      <P class=ind>Muslims and Arabs have nobody to blame but themselves for so 
      disastrous a social and political failure. There are intellectuals who 
      point this out, but they are few. It is far more comforting to displace 
      the blame on to others. At the very end of 1978, Ayatollah Khomeini 
      carefully staged a coup in Iran and seized power from the shah. In a large 
      and potentially rich country, he was able to bring up-to-date al-Afghani&rsquo;s 
      expressions of self-pity and revenge. 
      <P class=ind>Muslims, the ayatollah held, were weak because the West had 
      deliberately made them so. It was another self-serving falsehood. In 
      reality the West displays a yawning indifference to all manifestations of 
      religion, but the ayatollah crystallized the contemporary Islamic fantasy 
      that the West is actually out to destroy Islam. In response, Muslims had 
      the duty to unite against the West and all its works, especially in its 
      most salient incarnation, America, dubbed the Great Satan. He advised 
      Mikhail Gorbachev to show the way by converting to Islam. Nationalist 
      rulers, Saddam Hussein for instance, had to be obliged to subscribe to his 
      fantasy, if need be by war to the death. 
      <P class=ind>Muslims everywhere, rich and poor, educated men like Osama 
      bin Laden and illiterate youths, have eagerly absorbed Khomeini&rsquo;s 
      prescriptions and formed an archipelago of conspiratorial groups in half 
      the countries of the world, often clandestinely linked in a manner 
      reminiscent of former Communist cells, volunteering to right the wrongs 
      they believe to have been done to them, and to establish an Islamic 
      utopia. Many of them take advantage of Western medicine, technology, and 
      education, depending on these benefits that they are unable to provide for 
      themselves. The contradiction powers the grievance, impotence, and hate of 
      their fantasy. 
      <P class=ind>The suicide bombers have at last engaged the United States in 
      a test of strength according to their standards. Muslim—and especially 
      Arab—one-man rulers will be watching for signs that the United States 
      understands the stakes and has the resolve to act as it should. If they 
      detect weakness in Washington, they will have no choice but to pay 
      lip-service to the Islamic fantasy and at least pretend to join the 
      ideological war against the West. Anything less leaves them at the mercy 
      of assassination or a coup undertaken by extremists. American strength and 
      determination to see this through, however, will encourage them to join 
      the coalition of Western allies. As was exactly the case in forming the 
      earlier coalition to fight the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein, they and 
      others in their position must be sure to end on the winning side. 
      <P class=ind>For the present, we do not know whether the suicide bombers 
      had ultimate sponsorship from a Muslim or Arab state. Any such state must 
      also be brought to account, if necessary by an outright invasion that 
      leads to a change of regime. This is a just war if ever there was one, in 
      defence of life and liberty against an ideological enemy. If the United 
      States and its allies were to retreat from the test of strength imposed on 
      them, or botch it somehow through inadequate preparation or loss of will, 
      then the extremists will conclude that they have the West on the run. They 
      will strive on for victory. Who can guess how far hate and killing will 
      then spread, or how destructive it will prove for mankind. <!-- Standard Shirttail-->
