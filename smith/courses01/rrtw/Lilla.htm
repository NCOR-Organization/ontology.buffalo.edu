ark Lilla, a professor at the Committee on Social Thought at the  University
of Chicago, recently published "The Reckless Mind: Intellectuals in  Politics,"
about how writers and intellectuals have ended up justifying  communism,
fascism and other tyrannies. Eric Alterman spoke with him. </p>
 
      <p>Is there a special gene among intellectuals that lends itself to
the embrace  of tyranny? Are they less sensible than the general populace?</p>
 
      <p>If by "intellectuals" we mean those devoted to the life of the mind,
we can  see why they face more intensely a problem all human beings face:
that of  negotiating the distance between ideas and social reality. What
intellectuals  are prone to forget is that this distance poses not only conceptual
difficulties  but ethical ones as well. It is a moral challenge to determine
how to comport  oneself simultaneously in relation to abstract ideas and
a recalcitrant  world.</p>
 
      <p>Do you think a philosopher's political mistakes, like Heidegger's
Nazism or  Sartre's infantile Maoism, can destroy the value of their philosophical
 insights? </p>
 
      <p>I do not think the truth or value of Euclid's proofs are affected
by how he  may have treated his servants. But philosophy, when it is not
a merely formal or  symbolic exercise, is ultimately driven by the desire
to find the right way to  live, individually and collectively. We only take
thinkers seriously when we  consider their ideas in terms of their deepest
motivations and most obvious  consequences. We owe it to them, and ultimately
to ourselves, to reflect on  these connections.</p>
 
      <p>Are American intellectuals any more or less likely to embrace tyranny
than  European intellectuals?</p>
 
      <p>Twentieth-century continental and American intellectuals have been
attracted  to tyranny for different reasons. In Europe the issue since the
French  Revolution has been the legitimacy of the modern age: secularity,
democracy,  capitalism, and bourgeois culture. There the intellectual temptation
has been to  seek a return to some imaginary pre- modern idyll or the elimination
of one or  more aspects of modern life, especially bourgeois capitalism.
For 200 years  continental intellectuals flirted with tyrants who promised
radical alternatives  to modern life and heaped contempt on those who engaged
in meliorist reforms of  that life.</p>
 
      <p>American intellectuals are thoroughly modern and bourgeois. When
they embrace  tyranny it is usually out of ignorance and a na&iuml;ve optimism
about human nature.  We Americans find it easy to assume that political cut-throats
are just  misunderstood delinquents and that their tyrannical practices are
expressions of  cultural differences we should tolerate. To read such statements
today about the  fascists, Stalinism, the East bloc, and third-world dictators
is quite chilling.  Our own modern democratic and bourgeois convictions are
so strong that we have  trouble grasping political phenomena not governed
by our rules.</p>
 
      <p>You say Americans have misunderstood Michel Foucault's ideas about
oppression  in everyday institutions and Jacques Derrida's notion about the
linguistic  construction of reality. Why? </p>
 
      <p>The misunderstanding is bred of American optimism and provinciality.
 Americans take legitimacy for granted, so they fail to take seriously the
 illiberal and antimodern implications of certain European ideas they glean
from  translations and domesticate into English. When Foucault speaks darkly
of  "power" and Derrida of "deconstruction," they may very well be right.
But if  they are, that means that most of what their American proponents
believe about  individualism, freedom, democracy and justice is wrong.</p>
 
      <p>Does terrorism lend itself to an intellectual's embrace as well?
      </p>
 
      <p>Certainly there has been a fascination with "purifying" violence
and terror  in 20th-century intellectual life, as we see in the works of
Sorel,  Merleau-Ponty and Foucault. Yet it is also true that certain terroristic
acts  have woken people up, ending their illusions and their romanticization
of the  "other." I think here of the Cambodia massacres, the Munich Olympics,
the  Schleyer killing in Germany in the 70's. [Hanns-Martin Schleyer was
head of the  German business association and was murdered by the Red Army
Faction in the fall  of 1977.]</p>
 
      <p>How is it that intellectuals fall prey to what you call "philotyranny,"
 denying the nature of tyranny by romanticizing or excusing it, or denying
any  fundamental difference between tyrannical and democratic regimes.</p>
 
      <p>Political and intellectual life share a basis not only in reason
but in the  passions. Passion is not necessarily a bad thing: there are healthy
passions for  truth and justice that need to be cultivated. But those passions
also need to be  controlled, since they can make us mistake lies for truth
and tyranny for  justice. </p>
 
      <p>Is there a useful or proper role for intellectuals and philosophers
to  fulfill in politics? </p>
 
      <p>Modern democratic life poses a unique challenge to intellectuals
because it  is prosaic, operates through public institutions, relies on specialized
 knowledge and respects common opinion. Intellectuals, even (perhaps especially)
 those on the left, are aristocrats by nature: they have contempt for ordinary
 opinion and are impatient with technicalities and formalities. Modesty is
the  most difficult virtue for intellectuals to learn, but it is the most
important  one in democratic society.</p>
 
      <p>In studying this topic, which modern writers and thinkers strike
you as  having found the proper balance between thought and action? </p>
 
      <p>The intellectuals of our time I have most admired as models of probity
and  good sense were Raymond Aron and Isaiah Berlin. Aron, because he punctured
the  myth of the intellectual as moral critic "speaking truth to power."
He  understood that thinking responsibly in modern democratic society means
 mastering the complexities of that society and putting oneself in the shoes
of  those who must make decisions. Berlin, because he understood the romantic
 yearnings and discontents of the modern mind, yet also knew that they lay
at the  root of all the political disasters of our time.</p>
 
      <p>Have you ever felt yourself falling prey to any of the dangers you
describe  in your book?</p>
 
      <p>I've been tempted &#8212; if we don't think passionately we are not really
 thinking. And if we are not thinking we are not really alive.</p>
