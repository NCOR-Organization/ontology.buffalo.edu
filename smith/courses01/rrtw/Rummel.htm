<H3>ACKNOWLEDGMENT </H3></CENTER></FONT>I am indebted to the Political Science 
Department, University of Hawaii, for typing the manuscript for this book; 
especially Jeanette Matsuda for coordinating and facilitating all typing and 
duplication. 
<P>As for all my writing and creative activity, my wife Grace has been colleague 
and partner in this effort. Her frank comments, unsettling ability to unravel an 
argument with an "innocent" query, and concern for the underlying logic of my 
writing have contributed much to the coherence and consistency of this book. And 
not least, I owe to her thorough editing whatever polish it may have. 
Again-thanks, sweetheart.

<H3>1.1 THE QUESTION</H3></CENTER></FONT>We can ask about how much violence and 
war have occurred. And why. And about the role of perception and interests, the 
involvement of status and class, the framework of meanings and norms, and the 
function of conflict in the social order. And then, whether violence and war are 
inevitable. Such questions are ontological--they concern the reality of 
conflict. They were my questions in previous volumes, which I attempted to 
answer through empirical propositions and basic principles.<A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE14.HTM#1"><SUP><FONTSIZE=3>1</SUP></FONTSIZE></A> 
In a nutshell, I concluded that violence of some sort is inherent in the social 
process but that intense collective violence and war are not.<A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE14.HTM#2"><SUP><FONTSIZE=3>2</SUP></FONTSIZE></A> 

<P>But there is a second, equally important question transcending this reality 
and entering the kingdom of ends.<I> It asks what we should do, given the nature 
of conflict.</I> It goes beyond engineering or instrumental questions. It 
concerns the Good, the Just, the Right. That is, it involves ethical questions. 
And it focuses this final volume. 
<P>Put simply, I am asking this. Given the reality of violence and war, <I>what 
should be done to create a universal and lasting peace?</I> 
<P>My answer, which is the conclusion of this book,<A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE14.HTM#3"><SUP><FONTSIZE=3>3</SUP></FONTSIZE></A> 
these five volumes, and associated publications, can be put simply: <I>Promote 
freedom.</I>

<H3>1.2 THE REALITY OF CONFLICT </H3></CENTER></FONT>Conflict is part of a 
social process by which people, groups, and states adjust their different and 
changing interests, capabilities, and wills. It is both a manifestation of a 
breakdown in social expectations and a means by which new expectations can be 
formed. Through conflict, social order is established and adjusted. 
<P>More specifically, whether between individuals or groups, within or between 
states, conflict manifests a trial-and-error adaptation among subjective, 
individual worlds. It establishes a balance of powers--an interlocking 
equilibrium--between what we want, can get, and will pursue. The result is an 
associated structure of expectations, a definition of what each of us can 
reliably predict about others, what we can anticipate as the outcome of his 
behavior. Such reliable expectations are essential for social cooperation and 
the division of labor. And such expectations are built on a balance of powers--a 
complex of threats, promises, legitimacy, persuasion, and love. There is, 
therefore, a social bond between cooperation and conflict. Through 
disagreements, arguments, confrontations, fights, clashes, struggles, violence, 
and war, we build our social balances and assure cooperation. 
<P>Expectations tend to remain constant, like habits and routines. While, 
unfortunately, our desires and wants will shift, our abilities, resources, and 
skills, our preparedness, fitness, and conditions, will change. And our 
resolution and commitment will alter. As a result, the balance of powers 
underlying a structure of expectations will in time diverge from expectations 
and an increasing gap will form: what people or groups expect of each other, 
their rewards, benefits, and understandings, their rights and obligations, will 
no longer realistically accord with their interests, capabilities, and will. 
Tension and hostility may develop; uneasiness may be felt. In any case, the 
social atmosphere is ripe for some event to trigger conflict behavior. 
<P>Such behavior then serves to restructure expectations more in line with the 
changes that have taken place in the balance of powers, to recreate the 
conditions essential for cooperation. Conflict and cooperation are then 
complementary phases in the progress of social life. However, these phases are 
not cyclical. If the conditions or environment of a social relationship remain 
fairly constant, then the progression of conflict and cooperation forms a helix: 
conflict gets shorter and less intense, cooperation more durable and deeper, as 
people learn from previous conflict, expectations, and interaction. As a couple 
surviving the fights of their early married years and growing old together. 
<P>Such is the reality of social conflict in general. But what about violence? 
Conflict between groups and classes will not turn into collective violence 
unless the status quo is disrupted. This means that expectations governing 
rights and duties, benefits and obligations--our core social interests--have 
collapsed. Even then, such violence may not become widespread or turn into 
large-scale, collective violence or internal war unless the society is polarized 
along class lines. Pluralistic societies, in which interests are segmented by 
overlapping group memberships and roles, social mobility is free and positions 
open, and people may be in one class or another depending on their group 
membership, localize and contain collective violence. For this reason, exchange 
societies--the most diverse and pluralistic type--have the least violence; 
coercive societies, which create an overall we-they, command-obey class, have 
the most. 
<P>As a form of violence, war at the international level should be similarly 
understood. Its occurrence presupposes a breakdown of the international status 
quo, particularly territorially defined rights and interests. In turn, this 
presupposes that the balance of powers has shifted significantly: what states 
want, can get, and are resolved to fight for or defend has altered. But war may 
still not break out. For a status quo dispute may be between libertarian 
(liberal democratic) states, which, by virtue of their liberal cultures and 
diverse but also shared and cross-pressured interests, do not make war on each 
other. Or, if involving authoritarian or totalitarian states, there may be no 
ambiguity as to who is more powerful and can win. It is a breakdown in the 
status quo between totalitarian or authoritarian states, where both sides are 
roughly equal in power, that makes war most likely. 
<P>Concerning the international system, presently an international exchange 
society of libertarian, totalitarian, and authoritarian states, with a 
confederal form of government (the United Nations), the possibility of more 
general and intense wars increases as the system becomes polarized along class 
lines. In other words, as international rights and benefits, as spheres of 
territorial influence and control, become increasingly preempted by a small 
group of the most powerful states or elite, as the world becomes divided into 
command and obey classes of states, this division becomes the storm front of 
global war. 
<P>In very general terms, such is the reality of conflict, violence, and war. 
What is peace? Much will be said about peace in <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP2.HTM">Chapter 2</A> and <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP3.HTM">Chapter 3</A>. Here I need 
say only that peace is a structure of expectations based on a specific balance 
of powers. It is thus a social contract--an agreement or understanding that 
enables social cooperation and coexistence. Peace is therefore bound into the 
social process. Social order, and thus peace, is a phase in the process of 
social adjustment between individual psychological worlds. 
<P>Obviously. All this is but a charcoal sketch of conflict and war. Much detail 
is needed, colors must be added, a dynamic balance between details and 
impressions and masses and colors created. More directly, the social forces 
involved must be described; the role of situation, perceptions, interests, 
expectations, dispositions, given more detail; the precise linkages indicated; 
the underlying theoretical and philosophical assumptions made explicit. And of 
course, all must be empirically confirmed. Such was done in previous volumes, 
and, where relevant to my normative enterprise, such now will be done here.<A

<H3>1.3 ORIENTATION</H3></CENTER></FONT>This volume completes a rather large 
effort on which I might provide a final perspective. Throughout I have attempted 
to build an integrated, comprehensive view of social conflict. Each chapter of 
each volume was written to contribute to this. Each volume was meant to build on 
the previous work. What was developed in one volume became intrinsic to the 
next. As relevant, I have tried to cover the psychological, interpersonal, 
social, and international levels for understanding conflict and peace. In the 
process I have sought to unify philosophy, theory, and facts. I have tried to 
mold together metaphysics, mathematical theory, and empirical science. 
<P>These five volumes thus form a gestalt, a oneness. Each chapter, each part, 
and each volume contributes to this whole, but each also acquires more meaning 
and value from its participation in this whole--this picture of our conflict, 
war, and peace. Although each volume has been unveiled separately and each was 
meant to stand on its own as a contribution to understanding, now that all five 
are published they form one picture--a single landscape painting. I offer them 
to the scholarly-scientific world as such. 
<P>I pick this metaphor of a painting carefully, for it captures my view of this 
work and truth in general. The real social world is an infinite complex of 
potentials and dispositions, of constantly shifting sense impressions.<A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE14.HTM#5"><SUP><FONTSIZE=3>5</SUP></FONTSIZE></A> 
Each of us as scholar or denizen cognitively and perceptually structures this 
social world to make sense out of it and orient our actions within it. Each such 
structure (a perspective, really) is a dynamic simplification that provides 
understanding and direction. This perspective is partly of the real social 
world, but it is also partly of ourselves. It is a dynamic balance between what 
this social reality imposes on us and what we try to mold it into. Such is the 
painting of a landscape artist--a dynamic balance between the impression the 
artist wishes to convey and the actual landscape in its rich diversity. 
<P>Thus I present my painting of conflict and war. And peace. It forms an 
artistic totality, with a certain fidelity to reality, I trust, but also with a 
simplification necessary to convey an impression, to give unity, to make a 
point. Others, of course, will paint this reality differently. Different views, 
different skills, different techniques will be brought to bear. Therefore, I 
submit this painting in no belief that it is the only one, or the best of all, 
or without possible improvement. I do believe, however, that it presents a new 
and useful picture of conflict and peace to be hung alongside others in the 
gallery of our attempts to understand conflict and war and create a better, more 
peaceful world.

<H3>1.4 SUMMARY AND OVERVIEW</H3></CENTER></FONT>
<P>
<HR align=left width="30%" color=green SIZE=1>
<FONT color=green>
<H3><I>On Peace</I></H3></FONT>To determine a just peace requires a prior 
clarification of what peace means. The first part of this volume focuses on 
peace as a concept; the opening <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP2.HTM">Chapter 2</A> describes 
peace in detail. I point out that: 
<UL>
  <P>
  <LI>peace is a social contract based on a balance of powers (interests, 
  capabilities, wills); 
  <P></P>
  <LI>as a social contract, peace may be implicit or explicit, conscious or 
  subconscious, or socially narrow or comprehensive; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>diverse kinds of peace overlap and interrelate at all social levels; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>at the national and global levels peace is an overarching social contract 
  (norms, laws, rules, institutions) based on a specific balance of powers; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>peace is not the absence of violence, but an active, existing social 
  entity.</LI></UL>
<P><A href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP3.HTM">Chapter 3</A> then 
compares this idea of peace with other conceptualizations. Historically, peace 
has been seen as: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>a state of nonconflict, of nonviolence, of order, of mind, of law, of 
  coercive power, of divinity, of goodness; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>more particularly, concord, social or spiritual harmony and tranquility, 
  common government, abstract laws, a balance of power, equilibrium, or social 
  justice and equality. </LI></UL>
<P>Then, by comparison to these other concepts, peace as a social contract: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>is a broad conception subsuming a number of alternative views of peace; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>is ethically neutral, and thus will not normatively bias the definition of 
  a just peace.</LI></UL>
<P>
<HR align=left width="30%" color=green SIZE=1>
<FONT color=green>
<H3><I>On a Just Peace</I></H3></FONT>Given the above idea of peace, Part II 
focuses on justice. What is it? How can we define it? Since to answer these 
questions demands engaging the broader field of ethics itself, <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP4.HTM">Chapter 4</A> considers 
metaethics, or questions about what ethics is and how we can know, and then 
applies the answers to justice. It thus concludes that: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>statements about justice are descriptive, prescriptive, universalizable, 
  and moral; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>fundamental statements about justice are partly objective, partly 
  rational, partly attitudinal (or emotive), depending on whether the statements 
  are fundamental or instrumental; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>the realm of facts and justice partly overlap, such that facts limit our 
  choice of what is just, while the latter spotlights facts. </LI></UL>
<P>With this in mind <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP5.HTM">Chapter 5</A> and <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP6.HTM">Chapter 6</A> construct 
and use a social contract model to determine the principles of justice for 
organizing a peaceful society--that is, for a just peace. The basic idea is that 
the institutions of society should be those that people, each voting as one, 
without foreknowledge of their resulting status, position, or resources, would 
impartially and fairly select to live under. The model sets up a Global 
Convention of Minds in which all people will participate, debate, and vote on 
the principles for a new society, while in ignorance of their resulting 
advantages and disadvantages. <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP5.HTM">Chapter 5</A> presents 
this model; <A href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP6.HTM">Chapter 
6</A> considers the bargaining within the Convention. The latter concludes: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The presentation of alternative principles of justice and bargaining over 
  them most likely would be along the lines of contemporary global sociocultural 
  and political divisions. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>These divisions would be between sensate and ideational (materialistic 
  versus spiritual) cultures, among exchange, coercive, and authoritarian 
  societies, and among libertarian, totalitarian, and authoritarian political 
  formulas. </LI></UL>
<P>Given this probable division in the bargaining among all the world's people, 
<A href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP7.HTM">Chapter 7</A> considers 
possible solutions. It argues that: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>a middle or compromise solution--set of principles of justice--is 
  undefinable, but even were there such a solution a consensus across the 
  world's basic sociocultural and political divisions is inconceivable; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>therefore a solution can be found only at a meta, or second, order; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>at this second order the world's people likely would agree to something 
  like these two principles of justice: 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>people are free to form any community of their choice in order to 
    implement their own beliefs about justice, and 
    <P></P>
    <LI>people have a right to leave any community. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>The problem of a new society based on such principles, however, is that there 
is no guarantee that people or communities will observe them. As rights, free 
choice and free exit would be insecure. Therefore, <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP7.HTM">Chapter 7</A> also 
considers how people in the Convention would guarantee the two principles of 
justice, concluding that 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>there would be a consensus on four supporting constitutional principles, 
  which 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>guarantee the sovereign equality of communities; 
    <P></P>
    <LI>form a federal, global government to guarantee the just principles and 
    this sovereign equality; 
    <P></P>
    <LI>make this federation representative of communities and people; and 
    <P></P>
    <LI>provide this federation with a monopoly of force, but limit its scope to 
    a minimum. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>Finally, 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>the two just principles plus four constitutional principles define a just 
  peace; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>this just peace is what each of us would generally choose for ourselves 
  freely, fairly, and impartially, were we able; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>it maximizes social justice (consistent with nonviolence) by enabling each 
  of us to live as we consider just, consistent with the like freedom of others; 

  <P></P>
  <LI>it maximizes nonviolence (consistent with social justice) by creating a 
  global exchange society of communities. </LI></UL>
<P><A href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP8.HTM">Chapter 8</A>, the 
last in this part, then proposes a number of arguments independently supporting 
the idea of a just peace given above. Along with the social contract model these 
arguments provide a rational, empirical, and humanistic basis for a just peace. 
A just peace would: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>facilitate people mutually and reciprocally, through trial and error, 
  adjusting their different conceptions and attitudes about justice; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>comprise a metaethical method through which the diverse natures and 
  consequences of different views of justice can be tested; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>provide a metautopian framework in which each of us would be permitted our 
  utopia--to test our dreams and visions--consistent with a like freedom for 
  others; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>be consistent with John Rawl's priority principle of liberty plus his 
  supporting political institutions; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>reflect the actual historical, global choices of humankind, in that the 
  just peace is similar to many facets of the current international system that 
  has evolved over the centuries out of our needs and interests and our most 
  general sense for justice; and 
  <P></P>
  <LI>promote social harmony, social and economic welfare, social and economic 
  equality, and help alleviate poverty and hunger. </LI></UL>
<P>
<HR align=left width="30%" color=green SIZE=1>
<FONT color=green>
<H3><I>On Implementation </I></H3></FONT>It is not enough to define an ideal. We 
must also be able to point out the practical steps toward achieving it. This is 
the concern of Part III. Its <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP9.HTM">Chapter 9</A> briefly 
describes the philosophy of incrementalism that, I argue, should underlie any 
attempt to implement a just peace within a functioning status quo. In sum, this 
philosophy is that, 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>because we really do not know how any change will affect all the various 
  balances composing society, reforms in society should be made by small 
  increments to help evaluate the effects of each reform. That is, to test 
  through practice and to enable us to draw back from reforms if unexpected, 
  undesirable consequences occur. </LI></UL>
<P>However, if the status quo in society has or is breaking down, as in 
revolution or war, then incremental changes toward a just peace are not 
feasible. The question is then how to make a peace suitable to incrementalism, 
and then how to keep and foster this peace. Therefore, <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP10.HTM">Chapter 10</A> considers 
three principles of conflict resolution toward this end: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>you make peace by balancing powers; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>peace depends on keeping expectations and power aligned; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>freeing adjustment to change fosters peace. </LI></UL>
<P>Assuming now a stable status quo, what incrementally should be done to create 
a just peace? This is the question of <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP11.HTM">Chapter 11</A>, which 
essentially answers it through: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>The Positive Peace Principle: minimize the power of government.</I> 
  </LI></UL>
<P>For contemporary national societies this involves reducing the powers of 
their governments; for the global society it means increasing the power of the 
United Nations. Specifically, this principle entails five "vectors of action" to 
create, incrementally, a just peace within national societies: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>enhance and guarantee the freedom of choice and mobility of citizens and 
  groups; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>decentralize power; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>increase the horizontal distribution of government power; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>increase political participation of communities and people; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>decrease government's social and economic control and intervention. 
</LI></UL>
<P>For the international system there are also five "vectors of action" toward a 
global just peace: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>facilitate the right to emigrate; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>encourage and aid efforts at national self-determination and independence; 

  <P></P>
  <LI>gradually increase the representation of people, in addition to states, 
  within the United Nations; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>incrementally strengthen UN peacekeeping and peacemaking machinery; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>slowly transfer a monopoly of force to the UN. </LI></UL>

<H3>THE OVERALL CONCLUSION </H3></CENTER></FONT>Finally, the two chapters of 
Part V conclude this volume. With regard to creating a just peace, <A 
href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP12.HTM">Chapter 12</A> reduces 
these rive volumes to the following superordinate principle, and three 
corollaries. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>The Grand Master Principle: promote freedom.</I> 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Corollary 1: freedom maximizes the happiness and dignity of the greatest 
    number. 
    <P></P>
    <LI>Corollary 2: freedom maximizes social justice. 
    <P></P>
    <LI>Corollary 3: freedom maximizes peace from violence. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P><A href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/TJP.CHAP13.HTM">Chapter 13</A> 
refers this conclusion to the original questions that focused <I>Understanding 
Conflict and War</I>, and concludes that: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>some sort of violence in or between societies is inevitable, but extreme 
  violence and war are not; and 
  <P></P>
  <LI>to eliminate war, to restrain violence, to nurture universal peace and 
  justice, is to foster freedom. </LI></UL>
