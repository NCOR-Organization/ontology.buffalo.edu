      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2><FONT size=2>
        <P>I don't know a single Arab or Muslim American who does not now feel 
        that he or she belongs to the enemy camp, and that being in the United 
        States at this moment provides us with an especially unpleasant 
        experience of alienation and widespread, quite specifically targeted 
        hostility. For despite the occasional official statements saying that 
        Islam and Muslims and Arabs are not enemies of the United States, 
        everything else about the current situation argues the exact opposite. 
        Hundreds of young Arab and Muslim men have been picked up for 
        questioning and, in far too many cases, detained by the police or the 
        FBI. Anyone with an Arab or Muslim name is usually made to stand aside 
        for special attention during airport security checks. There have been 
        many reported instances of discriminatory behaviour against Arabs, so 
        that speaking Arabic or even reading an Arabic document in public is 
        likely to draw unwelcome attention. And of course, the media have run 
        far too many "experts" and "commentators" on terrorism, Islam, and the 
        Arabs whose endlessly repetitious and reductive line is so hostile and 
        so misrepresents our history, society and culture that the media itself 
        has become little more than an arm of the war on terrorism in 
        Afghanistan and elsewhere, as now seems to be the case with the 
        projected attack to "end" Iraq. There are US forces already in several 
        countries with important Muslim populations like the Philippines and 
        Somalia, the buildup against Iraq continues, and Israel prolongs its 
        sadistic collective punishment of the Palestinian people, all with what 
        seems like great public approval in the United States. </P>
        <P>While true in some respects, this is quite misleading. America is 
        more than what Bush and Rumsfeld and the others say it is. I have come 
        to deeply resent the notion that I must accept the picture of America as 
        being involved in a "just war" against something unilaterally labeled as 
        terrorism by Bush and his advisers, a war that has assigned us the role 
        of either silent witnesses or defensive immigrants who should be 
        grateful to be allowed residence in the US. The historical realities are 
        different: America is an immigrant republic and has always been one. It 
        is a nation of laws passed not by God but by its citizens. Except for 
        the mostly exterminated native Americans, the original Indians, everyone 
        who now lives here as an American citizen originally came to these 
        shores as an immigrant from somewhere else, even Bush and Rumsfeld. The 
        Constitution does not provide for different levels of Americanness, nor 
        for approved or disapproved forms of "American behaviour," including 
        things that have come to be called "un-" or "anti- American" statements 
        or attitudes. That is the invention of American Taliban who want to 
        regulate speech and behaviour in ways that remind one eerily of the 
        unregretted former rulers of Afghanistan. And even if Mr Bush insists on 
        the importance of religion in America, he is not authorised to enforce 
        such views on the citizenry or to speak for everyone when he makes 
        proclamations in China and elsewhere about God and America and himself. 
        The Constitution expressly separates church and state. </P>
        <P>There is worse. By passing the Patriot Act last November, Bush and 
        his compliant Congress have suppressed or abrogated or abridged whole 
        sections of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments, instituted 
        legal procedures that give individuals no recourse either to a proper 
        defence or a fair trial, that allow secret searches, eavesdropping, 
        detention without limit, and, given the treatment of the prisoners at 
        Guantanamo Bay, that allow the US executive branch to abduct prisoners, 
        detain them indefinitely, decide unilaterally whether or not they are 
        prisoners of war and whether or not the Geneva Conventions apply to them 
        -- which is not a decision to be taken by individual countries. 
        Moreover, as Congressman Dennis Kucinich (Democrat, Ohio) said in a 
        magnificent speech given on 17 February, the president and his men were 
        not authorised to declare war (Operation Enduring Freedom) against the 
        world without limit or reason, were not authorised to increase military 
        spending to over $400 billion per year, were not authorised to repeal 
        the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, he added -- the first such statement by 
        a prominent, publicly elected official -- "we did not ask that the blood 
        of innocent people, who perished on September 11, be avenged with the 
        blood of innocent villagers in Afghanistan." I strongly recommend that 
        Rep. Kucinich's speech, which was made with the best of American 
        principles and values in mind, be published in full in Arabic so that 
        people in our part of the world can understand that America is not a 
        monolith for the use of George Bush and Dick Cheney, but in fact 
        contains many voices and currents of opinion which this government is 
        trying to silence or make irrelevant. </P>
        <P>The problem for the world today is how to deal with the unparalleled 
        and unprecedented power of the United States, which in effect has made 
        no secret of the fact that it does not need coordination with or 
        approval of others in the pursuit of what a small circle of men and 
        women around Bush believe are its interests. So far as the Middle East 
        is concerned, it does seem that since 11 September there has been almost 
        an Israelisation of US policy: and in effect Ariel Sharon and his 
        associates have cynically exploited the single-minded attention to 
        "terrorism" by George Bush and have used that as a cover for their 
        continued failed policy against the Palestinians. The point here is that 
        Israel is not the US and, mercifully, the US is not Israel: thus, even 
        though Israel commands Bush's support for the moment, Israel is a small 
        country whose continued survival as an ethnocentric state in the midst 
        of an Arab-Islamic sea depends not just on an expedient if not infinite 
        dependence on the US, but rather on accommodation with its environment, 
        not the other way round. That is why I think Sharon's policy has finally 
        been revealed to a significant number of Israelis as suicidal, and why 
        more and more Israelis are taking the reserve officers' position against 
        serving the military occupation as a model for their approach and 
        resistance. This is the best thing to have emerged from the Intifada. It 
        proves that Palestinian courage and defiance in resisting occupation 
        have finally brought fruit. </P>
        <P>What has not changed, however, is the US position, which has been 
        escalating towards a more and more metaphysical sphere, in which Bush 
        and his people identify themselves (as in the very name of the military 
        campaign, Operation Enduring Freedom) with righteousness, purity, the 
        good, and manifest destiny, its external enemies with an equally 
        absolute evil. Anyone reading the world press in the past few weeks can 
        ascertain that people outside the US are both mystified by and aghast at 
        the vagueness of US policy, which claims for itself the right to imagine 
        and create enemies on a world scale, then prosecute wars on them without 
        much regard for accuracy of definition, specificity of aim, concreteness 
        of goal, or, worst of all, the legality of such actions. What does it 
        mean to defeat "evil terrorism" in a world like ours? It cannot mean 
        eradicating everyone who opposes the US, an infinite and strangely 
        pointless task; nor can it mean changing the world map to suit the US, 
        substituting people we think are "good guys" for evil creatures like 
        Saddam Hussein. The radical simplicity of all this is attractive to 
        Washington bureaucrats whose domain is either purely theoretical or who, 
        because they sit behind desks in the Pentagon, tend to see the world as 
        a distant target for the US's very real and virtually unopposed power. 
        For if you live 10,000 miles away from any known evil state and you have 
        at your disposal acres of warplanes, 19 aircraft carriers, and dozens of 
        submarines, plus a million and a half people under arms, all of them 
        willing to serve their country idealistically in the pursuit of what 
        Bush and Condoleezza Rice keep referring to as evil, the chances are 
        that you will be willing to use all that power sometime, somewhere, 
        especially if the administration keeps asking for (and getting) billions 
        of dollars to be added to the already swollen defence budget. </P>
        <P>From my point of view, the most shocking thing of all is that with 
        few exceptions most prominent intellectuals and commentators in this 
        country have tolerated the Bush programme, tolerated and in some 
        flagrant cases, tried to go beyond it, toward more self- righteous 
        sophistry, more uncritical self-flattery, more specious argument. What 
        they will not accept is that the world we live in, the historical world 
        of nations and peoples, is moved and can be understood by politics, not 
        by huge general absolutes like good and evil, with America always on the 
        side of good, its enemies on the side of evil. When Thomas Friedman 
        tiresomely sermonises to Arabs that they have to be more self-critical, 
        missing in anything he says is the slightest tone of self- criticism. 
        Somehow, he thinks, the atrocities of 11 September entitle him to preach 
        at others, as if only the US had suffered such terrible losses, and as 
        if lives lost elsewhere in the world were not worth lamenting quite as 
        much or drawing as large moral conclusions from. </P>
        <P>One notices the same discrepancies and blindness when Israeli 
        intellectuals concentrate on their own tragedies and leave out of the 
        equation the much greater suffering of a dispossessed people without a 
        state, or an army, or an air force, or a proper leadership, that is, 
        Palestinians whose suffering at the hands of Israel continues minute by 
        minute, hour by hour. This sort of moral blindness, this inability to 
        evaluate and weigh the comparative evidence of sinner and sinned against 
        (to use a moralistic language that I normally avoid and detest) is very 
        much the order of the day, and it must be the critical intellectual's 
        job not to fall into -- indeed, actively to campaign against falling 
        into -- the trap. It is not enough to say blandly that all human 
        suffering is equal, then to go on basically bewailing one's own 
        miseries: it is far more important to see what the strongest party does, 
        and to question rather than justify that. The intellectual's is a voice 
        in opposition to and critical of great power, which is consistently in 
        need of a restraining and clarifying conscience and a comparative 
        perspective, so that the victim will not, as is often the case, be 
        blamed and real power encouraged to do its will. </P>
        <P>A week ago I was stunned when a European friend asked me what I 
        thought of a declaration by 60 American intellectuals that was published 
        in all the major French, German, Italian and other continental papers 
        but which did not appear in the US at all, except on the Internet where 
        few people took notice of it. This declaration took the form of a 
        pompous sermon about the American war against evil and terrorism being 
        "just" and in keeping with American values, as defined by these 
        self-appointed interpreters of our country. Paid for and sponsored by 
        something called the Institute for American Values, whose main (and 
        financially well- endowed) aim is to propagate ideas in favour of 
        families, "fathering" and "mothering," and God, the declaration was 
        signed by Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukuyama, Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
        among many others, but basically written by a conservative feminist 
        academic, Jean Bethke Elshtain. Its main arguments about a "just" war 
        were inspired by Professor Michael Walzer, a supposed socialist who is 
        allied with the pro-Israel lobby in this country, and whose role is to 
        justify everything Israel does by recourse to vaguely leftist 
        principles. In signing this declaration, Walzer has given up all 
        pretension to leftism and, like Sharon, allies himself with an 
        interpretation (and a questionable one at that) of America as a 
        righteous warrior against terror and evil, the more to make it appear 
        that Israel and the US are similar countries with similar aims. </P>
        <P>Nothing could be further from the truth, since Israel is not the 
        state of its citizens but of all the Jewish people, while the US is most 
        assuredly only the state of its citizens. Moreover, Walzer never has the 
        courage to state boldly that in supporting Israel he is supporting a 
        state structured by ethno-religious principles, which (with typical 
        hypocrisy) he would oppose in the United States if this country were 
        declared to be white and Christian. </P>
        <P>Walzer's inconsistencies and hypocrisies aside, the document is 
        really addressed to "our Muslim brethren" who are supposed to understand 
        that America's war is not against Islam but against those who oppose all 
        sorts of principles, which it would be hard to disagree with. Who could 
        oppose the principle that all human beings are equal, that killing in 
        the name of God is a bad thing, that freedom of conscience is excellent, 
        and that "the basic subject of society is the human person, and the 
        legitimate role of government is to protect and help to foster the 
        conditions for human flourishing"? In what follows, however, America 
        turns out to be the aggrieved party and, even though some of its 
        mistakes in policy are acknowledged very briefly (and without mentioning 
        anything specific in detail), it is depicted as hewing to principles 
        unique to the United States, such as that all people possess inherent 
        moral dignity and status, that universal moral truths exist and are 
        available to everyone, or that civility is important where there is 
        disagreement, and that freedom of conscience and religion are a 
        reflection of basic human dignity and are universally recognised. Fine. 
        For although the authors of this sermon say it is often the case that 
        such great principles are contravened, no sustained attempt is made to 
        say where and when those contraventions actually occur (as they do all 
        the time), or whether they have been more contravened than followed, or 
        anything as concrete as that. Yet in a long footnote, Walzer and his 
        colleagues set forth a list of how many American "murders" have occurred 
        at Muslim and Arab hands, including those of the Marines in Beirut in 
        1983, as well as other military combatants. Somehow making a list of 
        that kind is worth making for these militant defenders of America, 
        whereas the murder of Arabs and Muslims -- including the hundreds of 
        thousands killed with American weapons by Israel with US support, or the 
        hundreds of thousands killed by US- maintained sanctions against the 
        innocent civilian population of Iraq -- need be neither mentioned nor 
        tabulated. What sort of dignity is there in humiliating Palestinians by 
        Israel, with American complicity and even cooperation, and where is the 
        nobility and moral conscience of saying nothing as Palestinian children 
        are killed, millions besieged, and millions more kept as stateless 
        refugees? Or for that matter, the millions killed in Vietnam, Columbia, 
        Turkey, and Indonesia with American support and acquiescence? </P>
        <P>All in all, this declaration of principles and complaint addressed by 
        American intellectuals to their Muslim brethren seems like neither a 
        statement of real conscience nor of true intellectual criticism against 
        the arrogant use of power, but rather is the opening salvo in a new cold 
        war declared by the US in full ironic cooperation, it would seem, with 
        those Islamists who have argued that "our" war is with the West and with 
        America. Speaking as someone with a claim on America and the Arabs, I 
        find this sort of hijacking rhetoric profoundly objectionable. While it 
        pretends to the elucidation of principles and the declaration of values, 
        it is in fact exactly the opposite, an exercise in not knowing, in 
        blinding readers with a patriotic rhetoric that encourages ignorance as 
        it overrides real politics, real history, and real moral issues. Despite 
        its vulgar trafficking in great "principles and values," it does none of 
        that, except to wave them around in a bullying way designed to cow 
        foreign readers into submission. I have a feeling that this document 
        wasn't published here for two reasons: one is that it would be so 
        severely criticised by American readers that it would be laughed out of 
        court and two, that it was designed as part of a recently announced, 
        extremely well-funded Pentagon scheme to put out propaganda as part of 
        the war effort, and therefore intended for foreign consumption. </P>
        <P>Whatever the case, the publication of "What are American Values?" 
        augurs a new and degraded era in the production of intellectual 
        discourse. For when the intellectuals of the most powerful country in 
        the history of the world align themselves so flagrantly with that power, 
        pressing that power's case instead of urging restraint, reflection, 
        genuine communication and understanding, we are back to the bad old days 
        of the intellectual war against communism, which we now know brought far 
        too many compromises, collaborations and fabrications on the part of 
        intellectuals and artists who should have played an altogether different 
        role. Subsidised and underwritten by the government (the CIA especially, 
        which went as far as providing for the subvention of magazines like 
        Encounter, underwrote scholarly research, travel and concerts as well as 
        artistic exhibitions), those militantly unreflective and uncritical 
        intellectuals and artists in the 1950s and 1960s brought to the whole 
        notion of intellectual honesty and complicity a new and disastrous 
        dimension. For along with that effort went also the domestic campaign to 
        stifle debate, intimidate critics, and restrict thought. For many 
        Americans, like myself, this is a shameful episode in our history, and 
        we must be on our guard against and resist its return.</P></FONT>
