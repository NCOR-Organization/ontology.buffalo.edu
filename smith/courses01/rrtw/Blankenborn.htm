            <P><B><A name=preamble></A>Preamble</B></P>
            <P><B>AT TIMES</B> it becomes necessary for a nation to defend 
            itself through force of arms. Because war is a grave matter, 
            involving the sacrifice and taking of precious human life, 
            conscience demands that those who would wage the war state clearly 
            the moral reasoning behind their actions, in order to make plain to 
            one another, and to the world community, the principles they are 
            defending. </P>
            <P>We affirm five fundamental truths that pertain to all people 
            without distinction: </P>
            <P>1. All <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#Human beings">human 
            beings are born free</A> and equal in dignity and rights.</P>
            <P>2. The <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#basic subject">basic 
            subject of society</A> is the human person, and the legitimate 
            role&nbsp;of government is to protect and help to foster the 
            conditions for human flourishing.</P>
            <P>3. <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#human beings naturally">Human 
            beings naturally desire to seek the truth</A> about life's purpose 
            and ultimate ends. </P>
            <P>4. Freedom of conscience and <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#religious freedom">religious 
            freedom</A> are inviolable rights of the human person.</P>
            <P>5. <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#killing in the name of God">Killing 
            in the name of God</A> is contrary to faith in God and is the 
            greatest betrayal of the universality of religious faith. </P>
            <P>We fight to defend ourselves and to defend these universal 
            principles. </P>
            <P>[<A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#top">Back 
            to Top</A>]</P>
            <P><B><A name="What Are American Values"></A>What are American 
            Values?</B></P>
            <P><B>SINCE SEPTEMBER 11</B>, millions of Americans have asked 
            themselves and one another, why? Why are we the targets of these 
            hateful attacks? Why do those who would kill us, want to kill 
            us?&nbsp; </P>
            <P>We recognize that at times our nation has acted with arrogance 
            and ignorance toward other societies. At times our nation has 
            pursued misguided and unjust policies. Too often we as a nation have 
            failed to live up to our ideals. We cannot urge other societies to 
            abide by moral principles without simultaneously admitting our own 
            society's failure at times to abide by those same principles. We are 
            united in our conviction - and are confident that all people of good 
            will in the world will agree - that no appeal to the merits or 
            demerits of specific foreign policies can ever justify, or even 
            purport to make sense of, the mass slaughter of innocent persons. 
            </P>
            <P>Moreover, in a democracy such as ours, in which government 
            derives its power from the consent of the governed, policy stems at 
            least partly from culture, from the values and priorities of the 
            society as a whole. Though we do not claim to possess full knowledge 
            of the motivations of our attackers and their sympathizers, what we 
            do know suggests that their grievances extend far beyond any one 
            policy, or set of policies. After all, the killers of September 11 
            issued no particular demands; in this sense, at least, the killing 
            was done for its own sake. The leader of Al Qaeda described the 
            "blessed strikes" of September 11 as blows against America, <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#the head of the world infidelity">"the 
            head of world infidelity."</A> Clearly, then, our attackers despise 
            not just our government, but our overall society, our entire way of 
            living. Fundamentally, their grievance concerns not only what our 
            leaders do, <I>but also who we are</I>. </P>
            <P><B>SO WHO ARE WE?</B> What do we value? For many people, 
            including many Americans and a number of signatories to this letter, 
            some values sometimes seen in America are unattractive and harmful. 
            Consumerism as a way of life. The notion of freedom as no rules. The 
            notion of the individual as self-made and utterly sovereign, owing 
            little to others or to society. The weakening of marriage and family 
            life. Plus an enormous entertainment and communications apparatus 
            that relentlessly glorifies such ideas and beams them, whether they 
            are welcome or not, into nearly every corner of the globe. </P>
            <P>One major task facing us as Americans, important prior to 
            September 11, is facing honestly these unattractive aspects of our 
            society and doing all we can to change them for the better. We 
            pledge ourselves to this effort. </P>
            <P>At the same time, other American values - what we view as our 
            founding ideals, and those that most define our way of life - are 
            quite different from these, and they are much more attractive, not 
            only to Americans, but to people everywhere in the world. Let us <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#briefly mention">briefly 
            mention four of them</A>.</P>
            <P>The first is the conviction that all persons possess innate human 
            dignity as a birthright, and that consequently each person must 
            always be treated as an end rather than used as a means. The 
            founders of the United States, drawing upon the natural law 
            tradition as well as upon the fundamental religious claim that all 
            persons are created in the image of God, affirmed as "self-evident" 
            the idea that all persons possess equal dignity. The clearest 
            political expression of a belief in transcendent human dignity is 
            democracy. In the United States in recent generations, among the 
            clearest cultural expressions of this idea has been the affirmation 
            of the equal dignity of men and women, and of all persons regardless 
            of race or color.</P>
            <P>Second, and following closely from the first, is the conviction 
            that universal moral truths (what our nation's founders called "laws 
            of Nature and of Nature's God") exist and are accessible to all 
            people. Some of the most eloquent expressions of our reliance upon 
            these truths are found in our <I>Declaration of Independence</I>, 
            George Washington's <I>Farewell Address</I>, Abraham Lincoln's 
            <I>Gettysburg Address</I> and <I>Second Inaugural Address</I>, and 
            Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s <I>Letter from the Birmingham 
            Jail</I>. </P>
            <P>The third is the conviction that, because our individual and 
            collective access to truth is imperfect, most disagreements about 
            values call for civility, openness to other views, and reasonable 
            argument in pursuit of truth. </P>
            <P>The fourth is freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. 
            These intrinsically connected freedoms are <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#widely recognized">widely 
            recognized, in our own country and elsewhere, as a reflection of 
            basic human dignity and as a precondition for other individual 
            freedoms</A>. </P>
            <P>To us, what is most striking about these values is that they 
            apply to all persons without distinction, and cannot be used to 
            exclude anyone from recognition and respect based on the 
            particularities of race, language, memory, or religion. That's why 
            anyone, in principle, can become an American. And in fact, anyone 
            does. People from everywhere in the world come to our country with 
            what a statue in New York's harbor calls a yearning to breathe free, 
            and soon enough, they are Americans. Historically, no other nation 
            has forged its core identity - its constitution and other founding 
            documents, as well as its basic self-understanding - so directly and 
            explicitly on the basis of universal human values. To us, no other 
            fact about this country is more important.&nbsp; </P>
            <P>Some people assert that these values are not universal at all, 
            but instead derive particularly from western, largely Christian 
            civilization. They argue that to conceive of these values as 
            universal is to <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#deny the distinctiveness">deny 
            the distinctiveness of other cultures</A>. We disagree. We recognize 
            our own civilization's achievements, but we believe that all people 
            are created equal. We believe in the universal possibility and 
            desirability of human freedom. We believe that certain basic moral 
            truths are recognizable everywhere in the world. We agree with the 
            international group of distinguished philosophers who in the late 
            1940s helped to shape the United Nations Universal Declaration of 
            Human Rights, and who concluded that a few fundamental moral ideas 
            are so widespread that they "may be viewed as <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#implicit in man's nature">implicit 
            in man's nature as a member of society</A>." In hope, and on the 
            evidence, we agree with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that the <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#arch of the moral universe">arch 
            of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice</A>, not 
            just for the few, or the lucky, but for all people. </P>
            <P>Looking at our own society, we acknowledge again the all too 
            frequent gaps between our ideals and our conduct. But as Americans 
            in a time of war and global crisis, we are also suggesting that the 
            best of what we too casually call "American values" do not belong 
            only to America, but are in fact the shared inheritance of 
            humankind, and therefore a possible basis of hope for a world 
            community based on peace and justice. </P>
            <P>[<A

            <P><B><A name="What About God"></A>What about God?</B></P>
            <P><B>SINCE SEPTEMBER 11</B>, millions of Americans have asked 
            themselves and one another, what about God? Crises of this magnitude 
            force us to think anew about first principles. When we contemplate 
            the horror of what has occurred, and the danger of what is likely to 
            come, many of us ask: Is religious faith part of the solution or 
            part of the problem? </P>
            <P>The signatories to this letter come from diverse religious and 
            moral traditions, including secular traditions. We are united in our 
            belief that invoking God's authority to kill or maim human beings is 
            immoral and is contrary to faith in God. Many of us believe that we 
            are under God's judgment. None of us believe that God ever instructs 
            some of us to kill or conquer others of us. Indeed, such an 
            attitude, whether it is called "holy war" or "crusade," not only 
            violates basic principles of justice, but is in fact a negation of 
            religious faith, since it turns God into <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#an idol to be used">an 
            idol to be used for man's own purposes</A>. Our own nation was once 
            engaged in a great civil war, in which each side presumed God's aid 
            against the other. In his <I>Second Inaugural Address in 1865</I>, 
            the sixteenth president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, put 
            it simply: "The Almighty has his own purposes."</P>
            <P>Those who attacked us on September 11 openly proclaim that they 
            are engaged in holy war. Many who support or sympathize with the 
            attackers also invoke God's name and seem to embrace the rationale 
            of holy war. But to recognize the disaster of this way of thinking, 
            we as Americans need only to remember our own, and western, history. 
            Christian religious wars and Christian sectarian violence tore apart 
            Europe for the better part of a century. In the United States, we 
            are no strangers to those who would murder at least in part in the 
            name of their religious faith. When it comes to this particular 
            evil, no civilization is spotless and <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#no religious tradition">no 
            religious tradition is spotless</A>.</P>
            <P>The human person has a basic drive to question in order to know. 
            Evaluating, choosing, and having reasons for what we value and love 
            are <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#characteristically human activities">characteristically 
            human activities</A>. Part of this intrinsic desire to know concerns 
            why we are born and what will happen when we die, which leads us to 
            seek the truth about ultimate ends, including, for many people, the 
            question of God. Some of the signatories to this letter believe that 
            human beings are by nature "religious" in the sense that everyone, 
            including those who do not believe in God and do not participate in 
            organized religion, makes choices about what is important and 
            reflects on ultimate values. All of the signatories to this letter 
            recognize that, across the world, religious faith and religious 
            institutions are important bases of civil society, often producing 
            results for society that are beneficial and healing, at times 
            producing results that are divisive and violent. </P>
            <P>So how can governments and societal leaders best respond to these 
            fundamental human and social realities? One response is to outlaw or 
            repress religion. Another possible response is to <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#embrace an ideological">embrace 
            an ideological secularism</A>: a strong societal skepticism or 
            hostility regarding religion, based on the premise that religion 
            itself, and especially any <I>public</I> expression of religious 
            conviction, is inherently problematic. A third possible response is 
            to embrace theocracy: the belief that one religion, presumably the 
            one <I>true</I> religion, should be effectively mandatory for all 
            members of society and therefore should receive complete or 
            significant state sponsorship and support. </P>
            <P>We disagree with each of these responses. Legal repression 
            radically violates civil and religious freedom and is incompatible 
            with democratic civil society. Although ideological secularism may 
            have increased in our society in recent generations, we disagree 
            with it because it would deny the public legitimacy of an important 
            part of civil society as well as seek to suppress or deny the 
            existence of what is at least arguably <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#an important dimension">an 
            important dimension of personhood itself</A>. Although theocracy has 
            been present in western (though not U.S.) history, we disagree with 
            it for both social and theological reasons. Socially, governmental 
            establishment of a particular religion can conflict with the 
            principle of religious freedom, a fundamental human right. In 
            addition, government control of religion can cause or exacerbate 
            religious conflicts and, perhaps even more importantly, can threaten 
            the vitality and authenticity of religious institutions. 
            Theologically, even for those who are firmly convinced of the truth 
            of their faith, the coercion of others in matters of religious 
            conscience is ultimately a violation of religion itself, since it 
            robs those other persons of the right to respond freely and in 
            dignity to the Creator's invitation. </P>
            <P>At its best, the United States seeks to be a society in which 
            faith and freedom can go together, each elevating the other. We have 
            a secular state - our government officials are not simultaneously 
            religious officials - but we are by far the western world's most 
            religious society. We are a nation that deeply respects religious 
            freedom and diversity, including the rights of nonbelievers, but one 
            whose citizens recite a Pledge of Allegiance to "one nation, under 
            God," and one that proclaims in many of its courtrooms and inscribes 
            on each of its coins the motto, "In God We Trust." Politically, our 
            separation of church and state seeks to keep politics within its 
            proper sphere, in part by limiting the state's power to control 
            religion, and in part by causing government itself to draw 
            legitimacy from, and operate under, a larger <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#moral canopy">moral 
            canopy that is not of its own making</A>. Spiritually, our 
            separation of church and state permits religion to <I>be</I> 
            religion, by detaching it from the coercive power of government. In 
            short, we seek to <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#separate church and state">separate 
            church and state for the protection and proper vitality of both</A>. 
            </P>
            <P>For Americans of religious faith, the challenge of embracing 
            religious truth <I>and</I> religious freedom has often been 
            difficult. The matter, moreover, is never settled. Ours is a social 
            and constitutional arrangement that almost by definition requires 
            constant deliberation, debate, adjustment, and compromise. It is 
            also helped by, and helps to produce, a certain character or 
            temperament, such that religious believers who strongly embrace the 
            truth of their faith also, not as a compromise with that truth but 
            as an aspect of it, respect those who take a different path. </P>
            <P>What will help to reduce religiously based mistrust, hatred, and 
            violence in the 21st century? There are many important answers to 
            this question, of course, but here, we hope, is one: Deepening and 
            renewing our appreciation of religion by recognizing religious 
            freedom as a fundamental right of all people in every nation. </P>

            <P><B>WE RECOGNIZE</B> that all war is terrible, representative 
            finally of human political failure. We also know that the line 
            separating good and evil does not run between one society and 
            another, much less between one religion and another; ultimately, 
            that line runs through the <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#middle of every human">middle 
            of every human heart</A>. Finally, those of us - Jews, Christians, 
            Muslims, and others - who are people of faith recognize our 
            responsibility, stated in our holy scriptures, to love mercy and to 
            do all in our power to prevent war and live in peace. </P>
            <P>Yet reason and careful moral reflection also teach us that there 
            are times when the first and most important reply to evil is to stop 
            it. There are times when waging war is not only morally permitted, 
            but morally necessary, as a response to calamitous acts of violence, 
            hatred, and injustice. This is one of those times.</P>
            <P>The idea of a "just war" is broadly based, with roots in many of 
            the world's <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#diverse religious and secular">diverse 
            religious and secular moral traditions</A>. Jewish, Christian, and 
            Muslim teachings, for example, all contain serious reflections on 
            the definition of a just war. To be sure, some people, often in the 
            name of realism, insist that war is essentially a realm of 
            self-interest and necessity, making most <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#attempts at moral analysis">attempts 
            at moral analysis irrelevant</A>. <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#we disagree">We 
            disagree</A>. Moral inarticulacy in the face of war is itself a 
            moral stance - one that rejects the possibility of reason, accepts 
            normlessness in international affairs, and capitulates to cynicism. 
            To seek to apply objective moral reasoning to war is to defend the 
            possibility of civil society and a world community based on justice. 
            </P>
            <P>The principles of just war teach us that wars of aggression and 
            aggrandizement are never acceptable. Wars may not legitimately be 
            fought for national glory, to avenge past wrongs, for territorial 
            gain, or for any other non-defensive purpose. </P>
            <P>The primary moral justification for war is to protect the 
            innocent from certain harm. Augustine, whose early 5th century book, 
            <I>The City of God</I>, is a seminal contribution to just war 
            thinking, argues (<A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#echoing Socrates">echoing 
            Socrates</A>) that it is better for the Christian as an individual 
            to suffer harm rather than to commit it. But is the morally 
            responsible person also required, or even permitted, to make for 
            <I>other</I> innocent persons a commitment to non-self-defense? For 
            Augustine, and for the broader just war tradition, the answer is no. 
            If one has compelling evidence that innocent people who are in no 
            position to protect themselves will be grievously harmed unless 
            coercive force is used to stop an aggressor, then the moral 
            principle of love of neighbor calls us to the use of force. </P>
            <P>Wars may not legitimately be fought against dangers that are 
            small, questionable, or of uncertain consequence, or against dangers 
            that <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#might plausibly be mitigated">might 
            plausibly be mitigated solely through negotiation, appeals to 
            reason, persuasion from third parties, or other nonviolent 
            means</A>. But if the danger to innocent life is real and certain, 
            and especially if the aggressor is motivated by implacable hostility 
            - if the end he seeks is not your willingness to negotiate or 
            comply, but rather your destruction - then a resort to proportionate 
            force is morally justified. </P>
            <P>A just war can only be fought by a legitimate authority with 
            responsibility for public order. <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#violence that is free-lanced">Violence 
            that is free-lance, opportunistic, or individualistic is never 
            morally acceptable</A>.</P>
            <P>A just war can only be waged against persons who are combatants. 
            Just war authorities from across history and around the world - 
            whether they be Muslim, Jewish, Christian, from other faith 
            traditions, or secular - consistently teach us that noncombatants 
            are immune from deliberate attack. Thus, killing civilians for 
            revenge, or even as a means of deterring aggression from people who 
            sympathize with them, is morally wrong. Although in some 
            circumstances, and within strict limits, it can be morally 
            justifiable to undertake military actions that may result in the 
            unintended but foreseeable death or injury of some noncombatants, it 
            is not morally acceptable to make the killing of noncombatants the 
            operational objective of a military action. </P>

            just war principles</A> teach us that, whenever human beings 
            contemplate or wage war, it is both possible and necessary to affirm 
            the sanctity of human life and embrace the principle of equal human 
            dignity. These principles strive to preserve and reflect, even in 
            the tragic activity of war, the fundamental moral truth that 
            "others" - those who are strangers to us, those who differ from us 
            in race or language, those whose religions we may believe to be 
            untrue - have the same right to life that we do, and the same human 
            dignity and human rights that we do. </P>
            <P><B>ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001</B>, a group of individuals deliberately 
            attacked the United States, using highjacked airplanes as weapons 
            with which to kill in less than two hours <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#over 3,000 of our citizens">over 
            3,000 of our citizens</A> in New York City, southwestern 
            Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. Overwhelmingly, those who died on 
            September 11 were civilians, not combatants, and were not known at 
            all, except as Americans, by those who killed them. Those who died 
            on the morning of September 11 were killed unlawfully, wantonly, and 
            with premeditated malice - a kind of killing that, in the name of 
            precision, can only be described as murder. Those murdered included 
            people from all races, many ethnicities, most major religions. They 
            included dishwashers and corporate executives. </P>
            <P>The individuals who committed these acts of war did not act 
            alone, or without support, or for unknown reasons. They were members 
            of an international Islamicist network, active in as many as 40 
            countries, now known to the world as Al Qaeda. This group, in turn, 
            constitutes but one arm of a larger radical Islamicist movement, 
            growing for decades and in some instances tolerated and even 
            supported by governments, that openly professes its desire and 
            increasingly demonstrates its ability to <A

            <P>We use the terms "Islam" and "Islamic" to refer to one of the 
            world's great religions, with about 1.2 billion adherents, including 
            several million U.S. citizens, some of whom were murdered on 
            September 11. It ought to go without saying - but we say it here 
            once, clearly - that the great majority of the world's Muslims, 
            guided in large measure by the teachings of the Qur'an, are decent, 
            faithful, and peaceful. We use the terms "Islamicism" and "radical 
            Islamicist" to refer to the violent, extremist, and radically 
            intolerant religious-political movement that now threatens the 
            world, including the Muslim world. </P>
            <P>This radical, violent movement opposes not only certain U.S. and 
            western policies - some signatories to this letter also oppose some 
            of those policies - but also a foundational principle of the modern 
            world, religious tolerance, as well as those fundamental human 
            rights, in particular freedom of conscience and religion, that are 
            enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
            Rights, and that must be the basis of any civilization oriented to 
            human flourishing, justice, and peace.</P>
            <P>This extremist movement claims to speak for Islam, but betrays 
            fundamental Islamic principles. Islam sets its face <I>against</I> 
            moral atrocities. For example, reflecting the teaching of the Qur'an 
            and the example of the Prophet, Muslim scholars through the 
            centuries have taught that <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#struggle in the path">struggle 
            in the path of God (i.e., <I>jihad</I>) forbids</A> the deliberate

            undertaken only at the behest of legitimate public authorities. They 
            <A 
            href="http://www.propositionsonline.com/Fighting_For/fighting_for.html#Muslim scholars">remind 
            us forcefully</A> that Islam, no less than Christianity, Judaism and 
            other religions, is threatened and potentially degraded by these 
            profaners who invoke God's name to kill indiscriminately.&nbsp; </P>
            <P>We recognize that movements claiming the mantle of religion also 
            have complex political, social, and demographic dimensions, to which 
            due attention must be paid. At the same time, philosophy matters, 
            and the animating philosophy of this radical Islamicist movement, in 
            its contempt for human life, and by viewing the world as a 
            life-and-death struggle between believers and unbelievers (whether 
            non-radical Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus, or others), clearly 
            denies the equal dignity of all persons and, in doing so, betrays 
            religion and rejects the very foundation of civilized life and the 
            possibility of peace among nations. </P>
            <P>Most seriously of all, the mass murders of September 11 
            demonstrated, arguably for the first time, that this movement now 
            possesses not only the openly stated desire, but also the capacity 
            and expertise - including possible access to, and willingness to 
            use, chemical, biological and nuclear weapons - to wreak massive,

            constitute a clear and present danger to all people of good will 
            everywhere in the world, not just the United States. Such acts are a 
            pure example of naked aggression against innocent human life, a 
            world-threatening evil that clearly requires the use of force to 
            remove it. </P>
            <P>Organized killers with global reach now threaten all of us. In 
            the name of universal human morality, and fully conscious of the 
            restrictions and requirements of a just war, we support our 
            government's, and our society's, decision to use force of arms

            <P><A name="no religious tradition"></A><I>no religious tradition is 
            spotless:</I> Intra-Christian examples of holy war or crusade 
            emerged with particular force in Europe during the 17th century. 
            According to some scholars, the principle characteristics of holy 
            war are: that the cause for which the war is fought has a clear 
            connection to religion (i.e., that the cause is "holy"); that the 
            war is fought under the banner and with the presumption of divine 
            authority and assistance (the Latin term used by 11th century 
            Christian crusaders was "<I>Deus Volt</I>," or "God wills it"); that 
            the warriors understand themselves to be godly, or "warrior saints"; 
            that the war is prosecuted zealously and unsparingly, since the 
            enemy is presumed to be ungodly and therefore fundamentally "other," 
            lacking the human dignity and rights of the godly; and finally, that 
            warriors who die in battle are favored by God as martyrs. 
            Eventually, in Christianity, the development of just war doctrine, 
            with its emphasis on moral universalism, largely called for the 
            elimination of religion as a just cause for war. As early as the 
            16th century, some natural law theorists such as Franciscus de 
            Victoria and Francisco Suarez were explicitly condemning the use of 
            war to spread religion. "Difference in religion," Victoria wrote, 
            "is not a cause of just war." See James Turner Johnson, <I>Ideology, 
            Reason, and the Limitation of War: Religious and Secular Concepts 
            1200 - 1740</I> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975), 
            112-123, 154. See also Roland H. Bainton, <I>Christian Attitudes 
            Toward War and Peace: A Historical&nbsp;Survey and Critical 
            Re-evaluation</I> (Nashville: Abingdon, 1960), 148.</P>

            human activities</I>: <I>A Call to Civil Society</I> (New York: 
            Institute for American Values, 1998): 16. This theme is developed in 
            Aristotle, <I>Metaphysics,</I> 1-1; Bernard J. Lonergan, <I>Insight: 
            A Study of Human Understanding</I> (New York: Longmans, 1958); and

            <P><A name="embrace an ideological "></A><I>embrace an ideological 
            secularism</I>: We wish here to distinguish "secular" from 
            "secularism." Secular, derived from the Latin term meaning "world" 
            and suggesting "in the world," refers merely to functions that are 
            separate from the church. Secularism, by contrast, is a philosophy, 
            an "ism," a way of seeing the world based on rejection of religion 
            or hostility to religion. </P>
            <P><A name="an important dimension"></A><I>an important dimension of 
            personhood itself</I>: For this reason, advocates of secularism may 
            underestimate the degree to which human societies, even in theory, 
            can simply dispense with "religion." Moreover, they almost certainly 
            miscalculate, even accepting many of their own premises, the social 
            consequences of suppressing traditional religion. For if we 
            understand religion to be values of ultimate concern, the 20th 
            century saw two world-threatening examples - Nazism in Germany, and 
            communism in the Soviet Union - of the emergence of secular 
            religions, or what might be called replacement religions, each 
            violently intent on eliminating its society's traditional religious 
            faiths (in effect, its competitor faiths), and each, when in power, 
            ruthlessly indifferent to human dignity and basic human rights. </P>
            <P>s<A name="separate church and state"></A><I>eparate church and 
            state for the protection and proper vitality of both:</I> As the 
            leaders and scholars who produced <I>The Williamsburg Charter</I> 
            put it in 1988, "the government acts as a safeguard, but not the 
            source, of freedom for faiths, whereas the churches and synagogues 
            act as a source, but not the safeguard, of faiths for freedom . . . 
            The result is neither a naked public square where all religion is 
            excluded, nor a sacred public square with any religion established 
            or semi-established. The result, rather, is a civil public square in 
            which citizens of all religious faiths, or none, engage one another 
            in the continuing democratic discourse." See James Davison Hunter

            <P><I>We<A name="we disagree"></A> disagree</I>: Intellectual and 
            moral approaches to war as a human phenomenon can generally be 
            divided into four schools of thought. The first can be called 
            realism: the belief that war is basically a matter of power, 
            self-interest, necessity, and survival, thereby rendering abstract 
            moral analysis largely beside the point. The second can be called 
            holy war: the belief that God can authorize the coercion and killing 
            of nonbelievers, or that a particular secular ideology of ultimate 
            concern can authorize the coercion and killing of nonbelievers. The 
            third can be called pacifism: the belief that all war is 
            intrinsically immoral. And the fourth is typically called just war: 
            the belief that universal moral reasoning, or what some would call 
            natural moral law, can and should be applied to the activity of war. 
            The signatories to this letter largely disagree with the first 
            school of thought. We unequivocally reject the second school of 
            thought, regardless of the form it takes, or whether it springs from 
            and purports to support our own society ("our side") or the side of 
            those who wish us ill. Some of the signatories have much respect for 
            the third school of thought (particularly its insistence that 
            non-violence does not mean retreat or passivity or declining to 
            stand for justice; quite the opposite), even as we respectfully, and 
            with some degree of fear and trembling, differ from it. As a group 
            we seek largely to embrace and build upon the fourth school of 
            thought. </P>

            Socrates' judgment that it is better to suffer evil rather than to 
            do it is conveyed to us by Plato in the <I>Apology</I> (32-c to 
            32-e) and constitutes a key moment in moral philosophy. </P>
            <P><A name="might plausibly be mitigated"></A><I>might plausibly be 
            mitigated solely through...non-violent means</I>: Some people 
            suggest that the "last resort" requirement of just war theory - in 
            essence, the requirement to explore all other reasonable and 
            plausible alternatives to the use of force - is not satisfied until 
            the resort to arms has been approved by a recognized international 
            body, such as the United Nations. This proposition is problematic. 
            First, it is novel; historically, approval by an international body 
            has not been viewed by just war theorists as a just cause 
            requirement. Second, it is quite debatable whether an international 
            body such as the U.N. is in a position to be the best final judge of 
            when, and under what conditions, a particular resort to arms is 
            justified; or whether the attempt by that body to make and enforce 
            such judgments would inevitably compromise its primary mission of 
            humanitarian work. According to one observer, a former U.N. 
            Assistant Secretary-General, transforming the U.N. into "a pale 
            imitation of a state" in order to "manage the use of force" 
            internationally "may well be a suicidal embrace." See Giandomenico 
            Picco, "The U.N. and the Use of Force," <I>Foreign Affairs </I>73 
            (1994): 15. See also Thomas G. Weis, David P. Forsythe, and Roger A. 
            Coate, <I>United Nations and Changing World Politics</I> (Boulder, 
            CO: Westview Press, 2001), 104-106; and John Gerard Ruggie, <I>The 
            United Nations and the Collective Use of Force: Whither? Or 
            Whether?</I> (New York: United Nations Association of the USA, 
            1996). </P>
            <P><I>V<A name="violence that is free-lanced"></A>iolence that is 
            free-lance...is never morally acceptable</I>: In just war theory, 
            the main goal of the legitimate authority requirement is to prevent 
            the anarchy of private warfare and warlords - an anarchy that exists 
            today in some parts of the world, and of which the attackers of 
            September 11 are representative embodiments. The legitimate 
            authority requirement does not, on the other hand, for several 
            reasons, apply clearly or directly to wars of national independence 
            or succession. First, these latter types of conflict occur within a 
            state, not internationally. Moreover, in many such conflicts, the 
            question of public legitimacy is exactly what is being contested. 
            For example, in the war for independence that resulted in the 
            founding of the United States, just war analysts frequently point 
            out that the rebelling colonies themselves constituted a legitimate 
            public authority, and further that the colonies had reasonably 
            concluded that the British government had, in the words of our 
            Declaration of Independence, become "destructive of these ends" of 
            legitimate government, and therefore itself had ceased to function 
            as a competent public authority. Indeed, even in cases in which 
            those waging war do not in any plain sense constitute a currently 
            functioning public authority - for example, the "Warsaw Ghetto 
            Uprising" of Polish Jews in 1943 against the Nazi occupation - the 
            legitimate authority requirement of just war theory does not morally 
            invalidate the resort to arms by those resisting oppression by 
            seeking to overthrow illegitimate authority.&nbsp; </P>
            <P><I>o<A name="other just war principles"></A>ther just war 
            principles</I>: For example, just war principles often insist that 
            legitimate warfare must be motivated by the intention of enhancing 
            the likelihood of peace and reducing the likelihood of violence and 
            destruction; that it must be proportionate, such that the social 
            goods that would result from victory in war discernably outweigh the 
            evils that will attend the war; that it must contain the probability 
            of success, such that lives are not taken and sacrificed in futile 
            causes; and that it must pass the test of comparative justice, such 
            that the human goods being defended are important enough, and 
            gravely enough in danger, to outweigh what many just war theorists 
            view as the standing moral presumption against war. This letter 
            focuses largely on principles of justice in declaring war (in the 
            terminology employed by many Christian just war thinkers, <I>jus ad 
            bellum</I>) and in waging war (<I>jus in bello</I>). Other 
            principles focus on justice in settling the war and restoring 
            conditions of peace (<I>jus post bellum</I>). See Jean Bethke 
            Elshtain (ed.), <I>Just War Theory</I> (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992);

            including 2,895 in New York, 184 in Washington, and 40 in 
            Pennsylvania. Although this letter refers to "our citizens," 
            included among those murdered on September 11 were many citizens of

            the April 18, 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, killing 63 
            persons and injuring 120; the October 23, 1983 bombings of U.S.

            1996 bombing outside the Khobar Towers U.S. military barracks in 
            Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 U.S. soldiers and wounding 515; 
            the August 7, 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and 
            Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 persons and injuring more than 
            5,000; and the October 12, 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, 
            Yemen, killing 17 U.S. sailors and wounding 39. This list is 
            incomplete. (See <I>Significant Terrorist Incidents, 1961-2001</I> 
            (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Public

            comprising this movement are also responsible for numerous failed 
            attempts at mass murder, both in the U.S. and in other countries, 
            including the attempt to bomb the United Nations and the Lincoln and 
            Holland Tunnels in New York in 1993 and the attempt to bomb the Los 
            Angeles International Airport on New Year's Eve 2000. </P>
            <P><A name="struggle in the path"></A><I>struggle in the path of God 
            (i.e., </I>jihad<I>) forbids</I>: The relationship between the 
            <I>jihad</I> and just war traditions is complex. Premodern 
            <I>jihad</I> and just war perspectives overlapped in important ways. 
            Both could legitimate wars aimed at advancing religion, and both 
            sought clearly to disassociate such wars from wars involving 
            indiscriminate or disproportionate tactics. In the modern era, 
            <I>jihad</I> has largely retained its confessional component - that 
            is, its aim of protecting and propagating Islam as a religion. The 
            confessional dimension of <I>jihad</I> thinking in turn seems to be 
            closely linked to the view of the state widely held by Muslim 
            authorities - a view that envisions little or no separation of 
            religion from the state. By contrast, modern Christian thinking on 
            just war has tended to downplay its confessional elements (few 
            Christian theologians today emphasize the value of "crusade"), 
            replacing them with more religiously neutral arguments about human 
            rights and shared moral norms, or what some Christian and other 
            thinkers term "natural moral law." Some Muslim scholars today seek, 
            in the case of <I>jihad,</I> more fully to recover the sense of the 
            term as "exertion" or "striving for good" in the service of God, 
            thereby similarly downplaying its confessional elements and 
            emphasizing, for our increasingly plural and interdependent world, 
            the term's more universal dimensions and applications. For example, 
            see Sohail M. Hashmi, "Interpreting the Islamic Ethics of War and 
            Peace," in Terry Nardin (ed.), <I>The Ethics of War and Peace:
