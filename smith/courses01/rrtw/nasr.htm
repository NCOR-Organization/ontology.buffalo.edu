      <CENTER></CENTER>Despite the presence of violence in many regions of the 
      world ranging from Ireland to Lebanon to the Pacific Basin and involving 
      many religions from Christianity to Hinduism, the Western world associates 
      Islam more than any other religion with violence. The Muslim conquest of 
      Spain, the Crusades - which were not begun by Muslims -, and the Ottoman 
      domination of eastern Europe have provided a historical memory of Islam as 
      being related to force and power. Moreover, the upheavals of the past few 
      decades in the Middle East and especially movements using the name of 
      Islam and seeking to solve problems of the Muslim world created by 
      conditions and causes beyond the control of Muslims have only reinforced 
      the idea prevalent in the West that in some special way Islam is related 
      to violence. 
      <P>To understand the nature of Islam and the truth about the assertion 
      often made of Islam's espousal of violence. it is important to analyze 
      this question clearly remembering that the word <I>islam </I>itself means 
      peace and that the history of Islam has certainly not been witness to any 
      more violence than one finds in other civilizations, particularly that of 
      the West. In what follows. however, it is the Islamic religion in its 
      principles and ideals with which we are especially concerned and not 
      particular events or facts relating to the domain of historical 
      contingency belonging to the unfolding of Islam in the plane of human 
      history 
      <P>First of all, it is necessary to define what we mean by violence. There 
      are several dictionary definitions that can be taken into account such as 
      'swift and intense force', 'rough or injurious physical force or action', 
      'unjust or unwarranted exertion of force especially against the rights of 
      others', rough or immediate vehemence' and finally 'injury resulting from 
      the distortion of meaning or fact'. If these definitions are accepted for 
      violence, then the question can be asked as to how Islam is related to 
      these definitions. As far as 'force' is concerned, Islam is not completely 
      opposed to its use but rather seeks to control it in the light of the 
      divine Law <I>(al-shari'a). </I>This world is one in which force is to be 
      found everywhere, in nature as well as in human society, among men as well 
      as within the human soul. The goal of Islam is to establish equilibrium 
      amidst this field of tension of various forces. The Islamic concept of 
      justice itself is related to equilibrium, the word for justice 
      <I>(al-'adl) </I>in Arabic being related in its etymology to the word for 
      equilibrium <I>(ta'adul). </I>All force used under the guidance of the 
      divine Law with the aim of re-establishing an equilibrium that is 
      destroyed is accepted and in fact necessary, for it means to carry out and 
      establish justice. Moreover, not to use force in such a way is to fall 
      prey to other forces which cannot but increase disequilibrium and disorder 
      and result in greater injustice. Whether the use of force in this manner 
      is swift and intense or gentle and mild depends upon the circumstances, 
      but in all cases force can only be used with the aim of establishing 
      equilibrium and harmony and not for personal or sectarian reasons 
      identified with the interests of a person or a particular group and not 
      the whole. 
      <P>By embracing the 'world' and not shunning the 'kingdom of Caesar', 
      Islam took upon itself responsibility for the world in which force is 
      present. But by virtue of the same fact it limited the use of force and 
      despite all the wars, invasions, and attacks which it experienced. it was 
      able to create an ambiance of peace and tranquillity which can still be 
      felt whenever something of the traditional Islamic world survives. The 
      peace that dominates the courtyard of a mosque or a garden whether it be 
      in Marrakesh or Lahore is not accidental but the result of the control of 
      force with the aim of establishing that harmony which results from 
      equilibrium of forces, whether those forces be natural, social or 
      psychological. 
      <P>As for the meaning of violence as 'rough or injurious physical force or 
      action', Islamic Law opposes all uses of force in this sense except in the 
      case of war or for punishment of criminals in accordance with the 
      <I>shari'a. </I>Even in war, however, the inflicting of any injury to 
      women and children is forbidden as is the use of force against civilians. 
      Only fighters in the field of battle must be confronted with force and it 
      is only against them that injurious physical force can be used. Inflicting 
      injuries outside of this context or in the punishment of criminals 
      according to the dictum of the <I>shari'a </I>and the view of a judge is 
      completely forbidden by Islamic Law. 
      <P>As far as violence in the sense of the use of unjust force against the 
      rights of others and laws is concerned, Islam stands totally opposed to 
      it. Rights of human beings are defined by Islamic Law and are protected by 
      this Law which embraces not only Muslims but also followers of other 
      religions who are considered as 'People of the Book <I>(ahl al-kitab)'. 
      </I>If there is nevertheless violation in Islamic society, it is due not 
      to the teachings of Islam but the imperfection of the human recipients of 
      the Divine Message. Man 15 man wherever he might be and no religion can 
      neutralize completely the imperfections inherent in the nature of fallen 
      man. What is remarkable, however, is not that some violence in this sense 
      of the word does exist in Muslim societies, but that despite so many 
      negative social and economic factors aggravated by the advent of 
      colonialism, overpopulation, industrialization, modernization resulting in 
      cultural dislocation, and so many other elements, there is less violence 
      as unjust exertion of force against others in most Islamic countries than 
      in the industrialized West. 
      <P>If one understands by violence 'rough or immoderate vehemence'. then 
      Islam is totally opposed to it. The perspective of Islam is based upon 
      moderation and its morality is grounded upon the principle of avoiding 
      extremes and keeping to the golden mean. Nothing is more alien to the 
      Islamic perspective than vehemence, not to say immoderate vehemence. Even 
      if force is to be used, it must be on the basis of moderation. 
      <P>Finally, if by violence is meant 'distortion of meaning or fact 
      resulting in injury to others', Islam is completely opposed to it. Islam 
      is based on the Truth which saves and which finds its supreme expression 
      in the testimony of the faith, <I>la ilaha illa 'Llah </I>(there is no 
      divinity but the Divine). Any distortion of truth is against the basic 
      teachings of the religion even if no one were to be affected by it. How 
      much more would distortion resulting in injury be against the teachings of 
      the Qur'an and the tradition of the Prophet! 
      <P>In conclusion it must be emphasized that since Islam embraces the whole 
      of life and does not distinguish between the sacred and the secular, it 
      concerns itself with force and power which characterize this world as 
      such. But Islam, in controlling the use of force in the direction of 
      creating equilibrium and harmony, limits it and opposes violence as 
      aggression to the rights of both God and His creatures as defined by the 
      divine Law. The goal of Islam is the attainment of peace but this peace 
      can only be experienced through that exertion <I>(jihad) </I>and the use 
      of force which begins with the disciplining of ourselves and leads to 
      living in the world in accordance with the dicta of the <I>shar'ia. 
      </I>Islam seeks to enable man to live according to his theomorphic nature 
      and not to violate that nature. Islam condones the use of force only to 
      the extent of opposing that centripetal tendency which turns man against 
      what he is in his inner reality. The use of force can only be condoned in 
      the sense of undoing the violation of our own nature and the chaos which 
      has resulted from the loss of equilibrium. But such a use of force is not 
      in reality violence as usually understood. It is the exertion of human 
      will and effort in the direction of conforming to the Will of God and in 
      surrendering the human will to the divine Will. From this surrender 
      <I>(taslim) </I>comes peace <I>(salam), </I>hence <I>islam, </I>and only 
      through this <I>islam </I>can the violence inbred within the nature of 
      fallen man be controlled and the beast within subdued so that man lives at 
      peace with himself and the world because he lives at peace with God.
