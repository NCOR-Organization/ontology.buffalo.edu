            events of world-shaking significance, of catastrophes or massacres, 
            we are inclined not only to feel ashamed (all too briefly) of our 
            querulous preoccupation with our own minor tribulations but also to 
            question the wider value of all our activities. I do not know 
            whether people who are faced by death in a few seconds' time see 
            their lives flash before them, as they are said to do, and pass 
            final judgment upon them; but whenever I read something about the 
            Khmer Rouge, for example, or the genocide in Rwanda, I reflect for a 
            time upon my own life and dwell a little on the insignificance of my 
            efforts, the selfishness of my concerns, the narrowness of my 
            sympathies.
            <P align=left>So it was when I first learned of the destruction of 
            the two towers of the World Trade Center. I was settling down to 
            write a book review: not of a great work, but of a competent, 
            conscientious, slightly dull biography of a minor historical figure. 
            Could any activity have been less important when set beside the 
            horrible fate of thousands of people trapped in the then 
            flaming</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"

            review, compared to the deaths of over 300 firemen killed in the 
            course of their duty, to say nothing of the thousands of others? 
            What was the point of finishing so laboriously insignificant a task 
            as mine?
            <P>In my work as a doctor in a prison, I save a few lives a year. 
            When I retire, I shall not in my whole career have saved as many 
            lives as were lost in New York in those few terrible moments, even 
            counting the time I spent in Africa, where it was only too easy to 
            save human life by the simplest of medical means. As for my writing, 
            it is hardly dust in the balance: my work amuses a few, enrages 
            some, and is unknown to the vast majority of people in my immediate 
            vicinity, let alone to wider circles. Impotence and futility are the 
            two words that spring to mind.</FONT>

            size=-1>et even as I think such self-regarding thoughts, an image 
            recurs in my mind: that of the pianist Myra Hess playing Mozart in 
            London's National Gallery even as the bombs were falling during the 
            Second World War. I was born after the war ended, but the quiet 
            heroism of those concerts and recitals, broadcast to the nation, was 
            still a potent symbol during my childhood. It was all the more 
            potent, of course, because Myra Hess was Jewish, and the enemy's 
            anti-Semitism was central to its depraved view of the world; and 
            because the music she played, one of the highest peaks of human 
            achievement, emanated from the very same land as the enemy's leader, 
            who represented the depths of barbarism.
            <P>No one asked, "What are these concerts for?" or "What is the 
            point of playing Mozart when the world is ablaze?" No one thought, 
            "How many divisions has Myra Hess?" or "What is the firepower of a 
            Mozart rondo?" Everyone understood that these concerts, of no 
            account in the material or military sense, were a defiant gesture of 
            humanity and culture in the face of unprecedented brutality. They 
            were what the war was about. They were a statement of the belief 
            that nothing could or ever can vitiate the value of civilization; 
            and no historical revisionism, however cynical, will ever subvert 
            this noble message.
            <P>I recall as well a story told by the philosopher Sir Karl Popper, 
            an Austrian refugee who made his home in Britain. Four cultivated 
            men in Berlin, as they awaited their expected arrest by the Gestapo, 
            spent their last night together</FONT><FONT 
            face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" color=#000000 
            size=-1>&mdash;</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" 
            size=-1>possibly their last night on earth</FONT><FONT

            size=-1>&mdash;</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" 
            size=-1>playing a Beethoven quartet. In the event, they were not 
            arrested; but they too had expressed by their action their faith 
            that civilization transcends barbarism, that notwithstanding the 
            apparent inability of civilization at the time to resist the 
            onslaught of the barbarians, civilization was still worth defending. 
            Indeed, it is the only thing worth defending, because it is what 
            gives, or should give, meaning to our lives.
            <P>Of course, civilization is not only an attachment to the highest 
            peaks of human achievement. It relies for its maintenance upon an 
            infinitely complex and delicate tissue of relations and activities, 
            some humble and others grand. The man who sweeps the streets plays 
            his part as surely as the great artist or thinker. Civilization is 
            the sum total of all those activities that allow men to transcend 
            mere biological existence and reach for a richer mental, aesthetic, 
            material, and spiritual life.
            <P>An attachment to high cultural achievement is thus a necessary 
            but not sufficient condition of civilization</FONT><FONT

            call such men civilized. On the contrary, they were more like 
            ancient barbarians who, having overrun and sacked a civilized city, 
            lived in the ruins, because they were still far better than anything 
            they could build themselves. The first requirement of civilization 
            is that men should be willing to repress their basest instincts and 
            appetites: failure to do which makes them, on account of their 
            intelligence, far worse than mere beasts.</FONT>

            take an emotional problem or two; but an awareness of the fragility 
            of civilization was instilled early, though subliminally, by the 
            presence in London during my childhood of large numbers of 
            unreconstructed bomb sites that were like the gaps between the 
            rotting teeth in an old man's mouth. Often I played in small urban 
            wildernesses of weeds and rubble, and rather regretted their gradual 
            disappearance; but even so, I could hardly fail to see, in the 
            broken fragments of human artifacts and in the plasterwork with 
            wallpaper still attached, the meaning of the destruction that had 
            been wrought before I was born.
            <P>Then there were the bomb shelters, in which I passed a surprising 
            number of childhood hours. They were ubiquitous in my little world: 
            in the school playgrounds and the parks, for example. That entry to 
            them was forbidden made them irresistibly attractive, of course. 
            Their darkness and fungal dampness added to their attraction: they 
            were pleasantly frightening; one never quite knew who or what one 
            might find in them. Had I been inclined to smoke, instead of being 
            instantly sickened by nicotine, that is where</FONT><FONT

            size=-1>I would have learned to do so. And many a first sexual 
            exploration took place in those inauspicious surroundings. 
            <P>Despite the uses to which we put them, however, we were always 
            aware of the purpose for which they had been built. Somehow, the 
            shades of those who had sheltered in them, not so very long before, 
            were still present. The Blitz was within every adult's living 
            memory: my mother's apartment building had been bombed, and she woke 
            one morning with half of it gone, one of her rooms now open directly 
            to the air. In my house, as in many other households, there was a 
            multivolume pictorial history of the war, over which I pored for 
            entire mornings or afternoons, until I knew every picture by heart. 
            One of them was ever present in my mind when I entered a bomb 
            shelter with my friends: that of two young children, both blind, in 
            just such a shelter, their sightless eyes turned upward to the sound 
            of the explosions above them, a heartrending look of incomprehension 
            on their faces. 
            <P>More than anything else, however, the fact that my mother was 
            herself a refugee from Nazi Germany contributed to my awareness that 
            security</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"

            and me, photographs (some of them sepia) of her life in pre-Nazi 
            Germany: a prosperously bourgeois existence of that time, from the 
            look of it, with chauffeurs and large cars, patriarchs in winged 
            collars conspicuously smoking cigars, women in feather boas, picnics 
            by lakes, winter in the mountains, and so forth. There were photos 
            of my grandfather, a doctor decorated for his military service 
            during the Great War, in his military uniform, a loyal subject of 
            the Kaiser. And then</FONT><FONT

            emerged into a new, less luxurious but more ordinary (because 
            familiar), life.
            <P>She had left Germany when she was 17 and never saw her parents 
            again. If it could happen to her, why not to me or indeed to anyone? 
            I didn't believe it would, but then neither had she or anyone else.

            size=-1>s soon as I was able, I began to travel. Boredom, curiosity, 
            dissatisfaction, a taste for the exotic and for philosophical 
            inquiry drove me. It seemed to me that comparison was the only way 
            to know the value of things, including political arrangements. But 
            travel is like good fortune in the famous remark of Louis Pasteur: 
            it favors only the mind prepared. To an extent, one brings back from 
            it only what one takes to it: and I chose my countries with 
            unconscious care and thereby received many object lessons in the 
            fragility of the human order, especially when it is undermined in 
            the abstract name of justice. It is often much easier to bring about 
            total disaster than modest improvement.

            size=-1>soon descended into the most terrible chaos. Their peace had 
            always been flawed, of course: as which is not? I learned that the 
            passion to destroy, far from being "also" a constructive one, as the 
            famous but foolish remark of the Russian anarchist Bakunin would 
            have it, soon becomes autonomous, unattached to any other purpose 
            but indulged in purely for the pleasure that destruction itself 
            brings. I remember watching rioters in Panama, for example, smashing 
            shop windows, allegedly in the name of freedom and democracy, but 
            laughing as they did so, searching for new fields of glass to 
            conquer. Many of the rioters were obviously bourgeois, the scions of 
            privileged families, as have been the leaders of so many destructive 
            movements in modern history. That same evening, I dined in an 
            expensive restaurant and saw there a fellow diner whom I had 
            observed a few hours before joyfully heaving a brick through a 
            window. How much destruction did he think his country could bear 
            before his own life might be affected, his own existence 
compromised?
            <P>As I watched the rioters at play, I remembered an episode from my 
            childhood. My brother and I took a radio out onto the lawn and there 
            smashed it into a thousand pieces with croquet mallets. With a 
            pleasantly vengeful fury, as if performing a valuable task, we 
            pursued every last component with our mallets until we had 
            pulverized it into unrecognizability. The joy we felt was 
            indescribable; but where it came from or what it meant, we knew not. 
            Within our small souls, civilization struggled with barbarism: and 
            had we suffered no retribution, I suspect that barbarism's temporary 
            victory would have been more lasting. 
            <P>But why did we feel the need to revolt in this fashion? At such a 
            remove in time, I cannot reconstruct my own thoughts or feelings 
            with any certainty: but I suspect that we rebelled against our own 
            powerlessness and lack of freedom, which we felt as a wound, by 
            comparison with what we saw as the omnipotence and complete freedom 
            of action of the grown-ups in our lives. How we longed to grow up, 
            so that we might be like them, free to do as we liked and give 
            orders to others, as they gave orders to us! We never suspected that 
            adulthood would bring its own frustrations, responsibilities, and 
            restrictions: we looked forward to the time when our own whim would 
            be law, when our egos would be free to soar wherever they chose. 
            Until then, the best we could do was to rebel against a symbol of 
            our subjection to others. If we could not be as adults were, we 
            could at least destroy a little of the adults' world.</FONT>

            frustrations it entails in many countries, but nowhere more starkly 
            than in Liberia in the midst of the civil war there. I arrived in 
            Monrovia when there was no longer any electricity or running water; 
            no shops, no banks, no telephones, no post office; no schools, no 
            transport, no clinics, no hospitals. Almost every building had been 
            destroyed in whole or in part: and what had not been destroyed had 
            been looted.
            <P>I inspected the remains of the public institutions. They had been 
            destroyed with a thoroughness that could not have been the result of 
            mere military conflict. Every last piece of equipment in the 
            hospitals (which had long since been emptied of staff and patients) 
            had been laboriously disassembled beyond hope of repair or use. 
            Every wheel had been severed by metal cutters from every trolley, 
            cut at the cost of what must have been a very considerable effort. 
            It was as if a horde of people with terrible experiences of 
            hospitals, doctors, and medicine had passed through to exact their 
            revenge.
            <P>But this was not the explanation, because every other institution 
            had undergone similar destruction. The books in the university 
            library had been one and all</FONT><FONT

            It was the revenge of barbarians upon civilization, and of the 
            powerless upon the powerful, or at least upon what they perceived as 
            the source of their power. Ignorance revolted against knowledge, for 
            the same reasons that my brother and I smashed the radio all those

            Hall, where the inauguration ceremonies of the presidents of Liberia

            size=-1>and a Steinway grand piano, probably the only instrument of 
            its kind in the entire country, two-thirds of the way into the hall. 
            The piano, however, was not intact: its legs had been sawed off 
            (though they were by design removable) and the body of the piano 
            laid on the ground, like a stranded whale. Around it were disposed 
            not only the sawed-off legs, but little piles of human feces.
            <P>I had never seen a more graphic rejection of human refinement. I 
            tried to imagine other possible meanings of the scene but could not. 
            Of course, the piano represented a culture that was not fully 
            Liberia's own and had not been assimilated fully by everyone in the 
            country: but that the piano represented not just a particular 
            culture but the very idea of civilization itself was obvious in the 
            very coarseness of the gesture of contempt.
            <P>Appalled as I was by the scene in the Centennial Hall, I was yet 
            more appalled by the reaction of two young British journalists, also 
            visiting Monrovia, to whom I described it, assuming that they would 
            want to see for themselves. But they could see nothing significant

            civil war in which scores of thousands of people had been killed and 
            many more had been displaced from their homes. They saw no 
            connection whatever between the impulse to destroy the piano and the 
            impulse to kill, no connection between respect for human life and 
            for the finer productions of human labor, no connection between 
            civilization and the inhibition against the random killing of fellow 
            beings, no connection between the book burnings in Nazi Germany and 
            all the subsequent barbarities of that regime. Likewise, the fact 
            that the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution in China had 
            destroyed thousands of pianos while also killing 1 million people 
            conveyed no meaning or message to them.
            <P>If anything, they "understood" the destruction of the piano in 
            the Centennial Hall and even sympathized with it. The "root cause" 
            of Liberia's civil war, they said, had been the long dominance of an 
            elite</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"

            presumably, that poverty is often said to be the "root cause" of 
            crime. The piano was an instrument, both musical and political, of 
            that elite, and therefore its destruction was itself a step in the

            <P>It concerns a young man aged 20, who still lived with his mother, 
            and who had tried to kill himself. Not long before, his mother's 
            current boyfriend, a habitual drunkard ten years her junior, had, in 
            a fit of jealousy, attacked the mother in the young man's presence, 
            grabbing her round the throat and strangling her. The young man 
            tried to intervene, but the older man was not only six inches taller 
            but much stronger. He knocked the young man to the ground and kicked 
            him several times in the head. Then he dragged him outside and 
            smashed his head on the ground until he was unconscious and blood 
            ran from a deep wound.
            <P>The young man regained consciousness in the ambulance, but his 
            mother insisted that he give no evidence to the police because, had 
            he done so, her lover would have gone to jail: and she was most 
            reluctant to give up a man who was, in his own words to the young 
            man's 11-year-old sister, "a better f--k than your father." A little 
            animal pleasure meant more to the mother than her son's life; and so 
            he was confronted by the terrifying realization that, in the words 
            of Joseph Conrad, he was born alone, he lived alone, and would die 
            alone.
            <P>Who, in listening to such cases day after day and year after 
            year, as I have, could fail to wonder what ideas and what social 
            arrangements have favored the spread of conduct so vile that its 
            contemplation produces almost physical nausea? How can one avoid 
            driving oneself to distraction by considering who is more to blame, 
            the man who behaves as I have described, or the woman who accepts 
            such behavior for the sake of a moment's pleasure? </FONT>

            individual psychopathology. Recently, I went to a soccer game in my 
            city on behalf of a newspaper; the fans of the opposing teams had to 
            be separated by hundreds of policemen, disposed in military fashion. 
            The police allowed no contact whatever between the opposing 
            factions, shepherding or corraling the visiting fans into their own 
            area of the stadium with more security precautions than the most 
            dangerous of criminals ever faces. 
            <P>In the stadium, I sat next to a man, who appeared perfectly 
            normal and decent, and his 11-year-old son, who seemed a 
            well-behaved little boy. Suddenly, in the middle of the match, the 
            father leaped up and, in unison with thousands of others, began to 
            chant: "Who the f--k do you think you are? Who the f--k do you think 
            you are?" while making, also in common with thousands of others, a 
            threatening gesture in the direction of the opposing supporters that 
            looked uncommonly like a fascist salute. Was this the example he 
            wanted to set for his son? Apparently so. The frustrations of 
            poverty could hardly explain his conduct: the cost of the tickets to 
            the game could have fed a family more than adequately for a week. 
            <P>After the game was over, I saw more clearly than ever that the 
            thin blue line is no metaphor. Had it not been for the presence of 
            the police (whose failures I have never hesitated to criticize), 
            there would have been real violence and bloodshed, perhaps even 
            death. The difference between an event that passed off peacefully 
            and one that would end in mayhem, destruction, injury, and death was 
            the presence of a relative handful of resolute men prepared to do 
            their duty.</FONT>

            advertisement for a firm of elegant and costly shirt- and

            to and flattery of the utmost coarseness and brutality. Savagery is 
            all the rage.
            <P>If any good comes of the terrible events in New York, let it be 
            this: that our intellectuals should realize that civilization is 
            worth defending, and that the adversarial stance to tradition is not
