      <P><!-- Body of the piece begins below --><I>History is strewn with the 
      wrecks of nations which have gained a little progressiveness at the cost 
      of a great deal of hard manliness, and have thus prepared themselves for 
      destruction as soon as the movements of the world gave a chance for 
      it.</I> <BR><FONT size=-1>—Walter Bagehot,</FONT> <FONT size=-1><I>Physics 
      and Politics</I></FONT> 
      <P><FONT size=+2>W</FONT>e suspect that few readers of <I>The New 
      Criterion</I> follow The Coup, a popular &ldquo;hip-hop&rdquo; group whose 
      expostulations are said to exhibit &ldquo;a strong anti-capitalist bent.&rdquo; Our 
      readers may therefore have missed the band&rsquo;s web page. Until recently, it 
      featured a picture meant as advance publicity for its forthcoming album 
      &ldquo;Party Music.&rdquo; In the foreground were shown two members of the group, one 
      of whom smirks as he presses a button on a detonator. In the background 
      was an image of the twin towers at New York&rsquo;s World Trade Center 
      exploding. 
      <P class=ind>That image was removed soon after the twin towers were 
      destroyed by terrorists on September 11. But presumably this 
      &ldquo;anti-capitalist&rdquo; band will find other ways of advertizing and peddling 
      its new album. After all, anti-capitalist feeling generally stops well 
      short of interfering with personal profit. And even with the image of the 
      twin towers in flames gone, &ldquo;Party Music&rdquo; is likely to offer fans of 
      hip-hop plenty to conjure with. There is, for example, the featured number 
      &ldquo;5 Million Ways to Kill a <FONT size=-1>CEO</FONT>.&rdquo; Such casual 
      exploitation of violence is business as usual in the pop music world these 
      days. But what does that say about our culture? 
      <P><FONT size=+2>O</FONT>n September 11, <I>The New York Times</I> ran a 
      long and flattering profile of Bill Ayers, who in the 1970s was a member 
      of the Weather Underground, the radical anti-American group that was 
      responsible for many acts of violence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret setting bombs,&rdquo; 
      Ayers says in the story&rsquo;s lead. &ldquo;I feel we didn&rsquo;t do enough.&rdquo; Well, we 
      wonder how many people were reading those lines when two hijacked 
      airliners screamed into the twin towers, killing some 6,000 civilians and 
      bringing the United States to a momentary stand-still. 
      <P class=ind>We have come to expect moral thuggery from the gutter-world 
      of rap and hip-hop. But <I>The New York Times</I>? What does it tell us 
      that our paper of record should run a chirpy profile of this affluent, 
      minor-league terrorist and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, a fellow member of 
      the Weather Underground in the 1970s who was once on the <FONT 
      size=-1>F.B.I.</FONT>&rsquo;s Ten Most Wanted List? Written by Dinitia Smith, a 
      <I>Times</I> staffer, the profile is a specimen of contemporary moral 
      imbecility. Smith flirts with the spectacle of transgression even as she 
      maintains a benignly nonjudgmental attitude toward these icons of violent 
      radicalism. Her profile, timed to coincide with the publication of 
      <I>Fugitive Days</I>, Ayers&rsquo;s memoir of his life on the lam, was designed 
      to boost a book that fondly recalls bombing the Pentagon and offers 
      instructions for making bombs. (This was also the point of the friendly 
      page-long interview with Ayers in <I>The New York Times Magazine</I> for 
      September 16.) Smith gushingly dilates on Ayers&rsquo;s &ldquo;ebullient, ingratiating 
      manner,&rdquo; his &ldquo;love affair with explosives,&rdquo; his and his fellow radicals&rsquo; 
      efforts to &ldquo;smash monogamy.&rdquo; She quotes a statement generally attributed 
      to Ayers and that summarizes the philosophy of the Weather Underground: 
      &ldquo;Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the 
      revolution home, kill your parents, that&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s really at.&rdquo; 
      <P class=ind>Ayers equivocates about whether he actually said that. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 
      been quoted so many times I&rsquo;m beginning to think I did,&rdquo; he coyly reports, 
      adding &ldquo;it was a joke about the distribution of wealth.&rdquo; Some joke. It is 
      approximately as funny as his September 14 letter to the <I>Times</I> 
      explaining that, after the World Trade Center bombing, his book is really 
      &ldquo;a condemnation of terrorism in all its forms.&rdquo; Right. It is worth noting 
      that Ayers is not only a newly published author but also a &ldquo;distinguished 
      professor of education&rdquo; at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
      Shouldn&rsquo;t lawmakers in Illinois pause to consider how they are 
      &ldquo;redistributing&rdquo; the taxpayers&rsquo; wealth at their state university? 
      <P><FONT size=+2>W</FONT>hat is it about higher education that encourages 
      political idiocy? Consider the case of Barbara Foley, a Marxist professor 
      of English at Rutgers University in New Jersey. In the wake of the deadly 
      assaults on New York and Washington, Foley posted a message on the 
      internet for her students. It dealt partly with readings for the class, 
      partly with the terrorist attacks. &ldquo;[W]e should,&rdquo; Foley wrote, &ldquo;be aware 
      that, whatever its proximate cause, its ultimate cause is the fascism of 
      u.s. [<I>sic</I>] foreign policy over the past many decades.&rdquo; 
      <P class=ind>Foley&rsquo;s pontificating did not end there. She went on to 
      advise her students that &ldquo;we should be well aware of the ways in which 
      this event will supply the ruling elite with a pretext for massive 
      repression and control. airport surveillance will be, truly, on the tip of 
      that iceberg.&rdquo; (We preserve Foley&rsquo;s avoidance of capitals since it is 
      probably by design: capital letters being a linguistic sign of unwarranted 
      hierarchy, you see.) 
      <P class=ind>Such behavior by an &ldquo;on-duty&rdquo; college professor is completely 
      inappropriate, of course. There is, first of all, the matter of gross 
      insensitivity. What if some of her students lost a parent, a spouse, a 
      sibling in those attacks? How would they like being told that the cause 
      was the &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; foreign policy of the United States? There is also the 
      larger issue of what an English professor is doing using official 
      communications with her class as a soapbox for political proselytizing. 
      Since when did memoranda about readings for a class in American literature 
      become occasions for expatiating on the supposed evils of American foreign 
      policy? 
      <P class=ind>Not that English professors have a monopoly on political 
      pandering. Iraq&rsquo;s Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan suggested that the 
      attacks were &ldquo;terrorist acts practiced by the American administration&rdquo; 
      against its own people. John Lahr, theater critic of <I>The New 
      Yorker</I>, apparently agrees: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE class=qb>An acid thought keeps plaguing me. Isn&rsquo;t it odd 
        that on the day—the day—that the Democrats launched their most 
        blistering attack on &ldquo;the absolute lunacy&rdquo; of Bush&rsquo;s unproven 
        missile-defence system, his &ldquo;theological&rdquo; belief in &ldquo;rogue nations,&rdquo; 
        that the rogue nation should suddenly become such a terrifying reality. 
        The fact that I could even think such a thought says more to me about 
        the bankruptcy and moral exhaustion of our leaders even in the face of a 
        disaster. In fear, the nation, to my mind, has always proved 
        mean-spirited and violent. </BLOCKQUOTE>Mark Steyn, who reported Lahr&rsquo;s 
      comments in Canada&rsquo;s <I>National Post</I>, put it perfectly when he 
      responded: &ldquo;No, John. It says more about the bankruptcy and moral 
      exhaustion of you: thousands of his fellow citizens die in a spectacular 
      act of war and one of New York&rsquo;s most glittering cultural arbiters idly 
      wonders—in public—if Bush staged it to distract attention from criticism 
      by Democrats.&rdquo; 
      <P class=ind>The horrific events of September 11 have often and accurately 
      been dubbed a &ldquo;wake-up call&rdquo; for America. Who can forget the image of that 
      Boeing 767 smashing into the south tower of the World Trade Center in a 
      coruscating bloom of smoke and flame? We hope that that image—and the 
      other heartbreaking images that followed in New York and at the 
      Pentagon—will prove to be a reveille in at least two distinct senses. 
      <P class=ind>First of all, we pray that those premeditated acts of 
      butchery will succeed in rousing America&rsquo;s military and foreign policy 
      from the sentimental torpor it has labored under (with periodic moments of 
      lucidity) since the debacle of Vietnam. President Bush was right to 
      describe the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington as acts of war. 
      They were directed primarily not at physical targets but at a way of life: 
      at American democracy and the freedom and political openness that nourish 
      it. They were part of what Binyamin Netanyahu called &ldquo;a war to reverse the 
      triumph of the West.&rdquo; Murderous though the attacks of September 11 
      were—they claimed more American lives than the attack on Pearl Harbor and 
      D-Day combined—we must assume that they were only the opening salvo in a 
      protracted campaign against the West. In recent years, we have tended to 
      conduct foreign policy alternately as a sort of diversity seminar 
      sponsored by the <FONT size=-1>ACLU</FONT> at some college campus or, more 
      cynically, as an instrument to increase political campaign contributions. 
      We can no longer afford those infantilizing luxuries 
      <P class=ind>Among other things, these latest terrorist attacks 
      demonstrated with cruel vividness that all cultures are not equal. They 
      showed that pledging allegiance to the values of Western democracy 
      ultimately involves fighting against ideas and regimes set on destroying 
      those values. Not only must we seek out and eliminate the individuals 
      responsible for those acts of war, we must also identify the states that 
      aid and abet terrorism and make sure they are rendered incapable of doing 
      so in the future. The commentator Jonathan Rauch was quite right when he 
      observed (<I>pace</I> Barbara Foley) that &ldquo;the cause of terrorism is 
      terrorists.&rdquo; They, and the social and political networks that nurture 
      them, must be eliminated root and branch. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>A</FONT>merica&rsquo;s wake-up call has sounded in the 
      corridors of the Pentagon and the State Department. It has also sounded in 
      the culture at large. Will it be heeded? It is a clarion calling us not 
      only to wake up but also to grow up. For almost two decades, <I>The New 
      Criterion</I> has battled against the rancid pieties of modish 
      multiculturalism. We have sought to expose the moral and aesthetic 
      degradation of popular culture, the political malevolence of efforts to 
      turn intellectual life into an ideological battleground, the adolescent 
      posturings of privileged individuals who pretend that civilization is an 
      impediment to true enlightenment. Some have regarded our efforts with 
      impatience, some with admiration. But the time has come to confront the 
      underlying political and spiritual realities of the so-called culture 
      wars. We can no longer afford to coddle rock groups that preach violence 
      and self-indulgence, journalists who glamorize felons, and professors who 
      seek to poison the minds and hearts of their students. As for the 
      repellent fantasies of cultural spokesmen like John Lahr, it is time they 
      were roused from their phantasmagoric slumbers. Please note: we are not 
      advocating that such messengers of nihilism be censored or persecuted. We 
      are advocating that they be recognized for what they really are: decadent 
      enemies of freedom. America can win the war against terrorism. It will not 
      be easy. It will not be quick. But with courage, perseverance, and 
      maturity we will prevail. The unanswered question is whether we are yet 
      ready to grow up. <!-- Standard Shirttail-->
