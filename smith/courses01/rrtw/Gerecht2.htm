                  THE Arab leaders of the Middle East think we're clever? Or to 
                  put it more politically: Do they think we can tell the 
                  difference between friend and foe? Among Arabs themselves, 
                  knowing who the good guys are has long been a devilishly 
                  difficult task, since the great divide--believer and 
                  infidel--is usually of little use in separating sides. From 
                  the tenth century on, the Middle East has been overwhelmingly 
                  Muslim, yet shifting allegiances and war were the common state 
                  of affairs between Muslim potentates. In contemporary times, 
                  it's only gotten worse since traditional ties of kith and 
                  kin--the second skirmish line of the Arab identity--have been 
                  extended into nation-states where modern ideologies have 
                  devolved into brutal despotisms that rely primarily on family, 
                  often with fratricidal intensity. The Assad regime in Syria, 
                  like Saddam Hussein's Baath party in Iraq or Yasser Arafat's 
                  Palestine Liberation Organization, can be a friend one day and 
                  try to kill you the next. <BR><BR>Fortunately, we don't have 
                  to play in intra-Arab politics. Knowing thine enemy for 
                  Washington ought to be an easier task. Which of course 
                  provokes the question: What in the world is the Bush 
                  administration doing indulging Saudi crown prince Abdullah's 
                  "peace" initiative? Why did the administration send the 
                  director of central intelligence, George Tenet, whose CIA 
                  credentials give him enormous significance in the 
                  conspiracy-laden Muslim world, to speak directly with 
                  Abdullah, as would a vassal to his lord? Why is the 
                  administration again sending General Anthony Zinni to the 
                  Middle East when there is an absolute certainty that in his 
                  mission he will appear feckless? And his fecklessness--made 
                  worse, of course, because Zinni is a renowned military man 
                  with quintessential American looks--will only undermine the 
                  more important, Iraq-related objectives of Vice President Dick 
                  Cheney's upcoming journey through the region. <BR><BR>An 
                  administration self-confident in war now insists on 
                  dissipating its awe by allowing itself to appear panicked by 
                  the Israeli-Palestinian "cycle of violence," warnings from the 
                  rulers of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and a Gallup poll depicting 
                  America in a bad light among the Muslim masses. Whatever one 
                  thinks about polling as a valuable social-science tool--and 
                  using polls in closed, distrustful Muslim societies is 
                  dubious--the publication of the Gallup poll at the same time 
                  as Abdullah's "peace" proposal and Egyptian president Hosni 
                  Mubarak's visit to Washington is an exquisite irony. In the 
                  Arab world, no two states have done more to fan hatred of 
                  America than have Washington's two primary Arab "allies." 
                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>PRINCE Abdullah and President Mubarak 
                  encouraged Yasser Arafat to trash the Camp David talks with 
                  President Clinton and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak in 
                  July 2000. Does the administration really believe that 
                  Abdullah has now abandoned the principles that define his 
                  identity, his faith, and his country's foreign policy? It is 
                  inconceivable that Abdullah now wants Arafat to accept less 
                  than what Abdullah, Mubarak, and Arafat rejected before. The 
                  only statements that matter are those that are publicly 
                  expressed in Arabic to the Arab world, and the three gentlemen 
                  have given no indication whatsoever that Arafat's decision to 
                  scuttle the Clinton administration's diplomacy was wrong. 
                  <BR><BR>Is it at all reasonable to believe that Prince 
                  Abdullah, a devout Muslim who with his family rules over the 
                  oldest, most militant Islamic state, could ever imagine an 
                  Israeli embassy in the "country of the two Holy Places" (Mecca 
                  and Medina), a land whose better-educated denizens can explain 
                  to you at length how a Jewish cabal is trying to ruin the Arab 
                  and Muslim worlds and despoil "Christian America"? And Riyadh, 
                  with its American-educated bureaucrats, is enlightened 
                  compared with Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi heartland in the Najd, 
                  where if a referendum were taken tomorrow about restoring 
                  slavery--banned in the Kingdom only in 1962--it might pass. 
                  <BR><BR>Behind our backs, and often to our faces, Egyptian and 
                  Saudi officials have belittled us. In their state-controlled 
                  (in the Saudi case, family-owned) media, Egypt and Saudi 
                  Arabia have relentlessly attacked us and advanced Nazi-like 
                  anti-Semitism throughout the Muslim world. Since September 11, 
                  it does not appear that Saudi missionaries and Saudi-financed 
                  religious organizations--preeminently the World Muslim League 
                  (ar-Rabita al-Islamiyya al-'Alamiyya)--have in any way altered 
                  their message of contempt and hatred for the West. I've 
                  recently visited Saudi-financed proselytizing organizations in 
                  Western Europe, and they still reek of studied loathing for 
                  the United States. <BR><BR>And the Egyptian government is no 
                  better. When in Washington, President Mubarak was concerned 
                  with helping America in the Middle East; in Egypt, he is in 
                  the process of destroying the American University in Cairo, 
                  which along with the American University of Beirut has been 
                  the great symbol of American education and culture in the 
                  region. Avaricious and power-hungry, Mubarak's wife has led 
                  the charge to force the sale of AUC in downtown Cairo so that 
                  Mubarak, Inc., can tear down the gracefully crenellated 
                  university to build luxury high-rises and other profitable 
                  enterprises. In compensation, the Egyptian government has 
                  generously donated land in the desert for a new university. 
                  <BR><BR>Hosni Mubarak, who increasingly appears as a cross 
                  between Pharaoh and a well-manicured Tony Soprano, tells his 
                  people with his words and deeds that his dominion is 
                  unchallengeable, that he can command America's attention and 
                  largesse (currently around $2 billion per annum), and belittle 
                  the United States as he chooses in downtown Cairo. During his 
                  dictatorship, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser loathed 
                  seeing the American flag fly above the American University and 
                  often launched menacing words toward the institution. But he 
                  never touched it. "Our friend Hosni," as American officials 
                  have often referred to the Egyptian, intends to demolish it. 
                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>IT IS no coincidence that the two countries 
                  whose political and educational systems produced September 11 
                  are now promoting a new Arab-Israeli "peace process." They 
                  have, with the assistance of the New York Times's Thomas 
                  Friedman, successfully turned the conversation away from 
                  September 11 to the much more familiar and far less 
                  threatening subject of the Arab-Israeli clash. If they can 
                  make the Americans believe that the Israeli-Palestinian 
                  confrontation can upend the U.S. strategic position in the 
                  Middle East by threatening to awake the mythical "Arab 
                  street," and if they can successfully imply to Washington that 
                  the Israeli-Palestinian "cycle of violence"--that is, the 
                  Israeli military response to Palestinian terrorism--may 
                  unleash further kamikaze holy warriors against America, then 
                  they can probably put U.S. foreign policy in the region on the 
                  defensive. The Bush administration's evident desire to have 
                  Muslim cover for U.S. military action in the Middle East--now 
                  in Afghanistan, tomorrow in Iraq--encourages Cairo and Riyadh 
                  to believe they can indeed obtain some kind of a check on U.S. 
                  policy by playing the Palestinian card. <BR><BR>Washington 
                  needs to wean itself from viewing the Israeli-Palestinian 
                  collision as the center of the Middle East. We have lived for 
                  decades with the imminent threat of the Arab street. The Near 
                  East Bureau of the State Department, and easily panicked U.S. 
                  embassies and consulates in the Muslim world, have often 
                  written about the doom and gloom just beyond the barbed-wire 
                  walls. Yet not once has the street arisen. It is very unlikely 
                  that Hosni Mubarak's rule in Egypt or the House of Saud's rule 
                  in Arabia is at all threatened by the Israeli-Palestinian 
                  confrontation. Just the opposite is nearer the truth. Mubarak 
                  and the Saudi family are quite adept at encouraging public 
                  anger against the United States to protect and fortify their 
                  despotic regimes, to make them seem one with the people--a 
                  hard trick given that Mubarak, who likes to spend his time at 
                  luxurious Sinai resorts, and the oil-fattened Saudi royal 
                  family live distinctly uncommon lives. But the Egyptians and 
                  the Saudis deserve praise: It requires political dexterity and 
                  subtlety to run effective dictatorships that can nevertheless 
                  elicit American support by suggesting their fragility. Iran's 
                  Islamic revolution also helps: It spooks us and emboldens 
                  them. <BR><BR>But September 11 should have told us that we 
                  must break free from the State Department's traditional 
                  interpretation of the Middle East. Before the war in 
                  Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda saw us as weak. Bin 
                  Laden, like most if not all Muslim fundamentalists, viewed the 
                  1990s as a time of American retreat. President Clinton's 
                  failure of nerve in Somalia, his palpable fear of confronting 
                  Saddam Hussein militarily, and the administration's botched 
                  coup and abandoned Iraqi opposition were seen by many Muslims, 
                  certainly by the fundamentalist set, as proof that Americans 
                  no longer were, as bin Laden put it, "the strongest horse." 
                  The psychological impact of the Israeli-American embrace of 
                  the Oslo process, which essentially amounted to the joint hope 
                  that Israeli concessions could somehow propitiate the PLO's 
                  deep yearning for the eradication of the Jewish state, further 
                  inflamed the militants' hope. <BR><BR>The Islamic kamikazes in 
                  Israel are not blowing themselves to bits because Israel 
                  refuses to give back all of the "settlements," which comprise 
                  a bit less than 1.5 percent of the West Bank and Gaza; they 
                  are not killing themselves because of where and how a 
                  sovereignty line should be drawn in East Jerusalem. (These are 
                  issues about which secularized Muslims and American newspapers 
                  grow angry.) They certainly don't blow their intestines all 
                  over the streets, as President Mubarak suggested, because they 
                  have no hope economically. If this were the case, Cairo's 
                  roads would be splattered crimson, since the average 
                  Palestinian certainly has more economic hope than the average 
                  Cairene. <BR><BR>Palestinian holy warriors are martyring 
                  themselves because they believe that with God's help they can 
                  smite the Jews and take back all that they believe was theirs. 
                  Muslim holy warriors, be they the men of al Qaeda, the Iranian 
                  boys who rode across minefields on motorcycles in the 
                  Iran-Iraq war, or the Palestinians who rap their heads with 
                  Quranic surahs in their goodbye videos, are individuals who 
                  operate from hope, not despair, who see their sacrifice as a 
                  starring role in a passion play of Good versus Evil. Islamic 
                  militants don't want to compromise with Israel any more than 
                  Osama bin Laden wants to compromise with America. 
                  <BR><BR>Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres gambled that by 
                  resuscitating Arafat and the PLO as a negotiating partner they 
                  could create a thankful petty dictator on the West Bank and 
                  Gaza who would control the passions of the Palestinian people. 
                  For decades, the PLO chairman had fed Palestinians the promise 
                  that one day Israel would cease to exist. Arafat, who has lied 
                  about almost everything to almost everyone, has however been 
                  faithful to his youthful dreams forged in Egypt's oldest 
                  fundamentalist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. He, too, 
                  really can't see Israel and a Palestinian state coexisting. It 
                  is extremely doubtful that Arafat's muscle men, lieutenants 
                  like Marwan Barghuti, Muhammad Dahlan, and Jibril Rajub, can 
                  stomach the idea either. Too many young Palestinian men carry 
                  the disease--the religiously inspired hope that they can 
                  through violence wear down the Israelis--for negotiations 
                  between Israelis and Palestinians to have any value. 
                  <BR><BR>Only an overwhelming Israeli military victory against 
                  the Palestinian Authority, in particular against Arafat's men, 
                  will likely burn out the hope that Palestinian fighters and 
                  kamikazes can eventually bring Israel to its knees. Israel is 
                  now just about where King Hussein was in August 1970, when 
                  Yasser Arafat and his men threatened to bring down the 
                  Hashemite monarchy and replace it with a radical Palestinian 
                  state east of the Jordan river. King Hussein, after girding 
                  his loins, struck back with his Bedouin Legion, killing around 
                  5,000 Palestinians. <BR><BR>Contrary to Secretary of State 
                  Colin Powell's bloodthirsty aspersion on the Israeli prime 
                  minister, Ariel Sharon has shown little appetite for the type 
                  of warfare that King Hussein used against Palestinians. 
                  Sharon's tactics with armor, helicopters, F-16s, and targeted 
                  killings of Palestinian extremists have all been designed to 
                  minimize both Israeli and Palestinian casualties. If Arafat's 
                  lieutenants are going around giving out their traceable 
                  cell-phone numbers to American journalists, you can rest 
                  assured that the Palestinian Authority doesn't really believe 
                  its own rhetoric about the lethality and savagery of Israel's 
                  military actions. <BR><BR>Which isn't at all surprising, of 
                  course, since the Israelis have become so profoundly 
                  Americanized. It's a decent bet that when Palestinian fighters 
                  look at their enemy even now, after Sharon's harsher words 
                  about relentlessly pounding Palestinian targets, they don't 
                  see a tough, unrelenting foe. Arabs are fond of exaggerated, 
                  grandiose language; older Palestinians, who can remember 
                  Lebanon in 1982 and Jordan in 1970, know what a determined 
                  enemy really is. Israelis are overwhelmingly sensible, 
                  liberal- minded people who are obviously scared of reoccupying 
                  the West Bank. Yasser Arafat, his lieutenants, and the 
                  Palestinian holy warriors can surely smell that fear and find 
                  it inspiring. <BR><BR><BR><BR>THOUGH Secretary Powell's 
                  sympathy for the Palestinians that he so forcefully expressed 
                  in Congress is estimable, his critique of history--that wars 
                  don't settle disputes between hostile parties--is just not 
                  true. Wars are the primary, and easily the most successful, 
                  instrument for resolving conflict. We may morally recoil from 
                  what war demands of us--and in that revulsion lies our 
                  humanity--but it is preposterous to suggest that diplomacy has 
                  any relevance when your enemy is hurling suicide bombers at 
                  you. The "peace process" for years, probably decades, is 
                  finished. <BR><BR>In the Middle East, America's awe--the key 
                  element that gives both us and our Israeli and Arab friends 
                  security--can only be damaged by a Bush administration 
                  publicly fretting about Ariel Sharon's prosecution of his war 
                  against the Palestinian Authority. Though the Near East Bureau 
                  at State hates the notion, the tougher Sharon becomes, the 
                  stronger our image will be in the Middle East. But we need to 
                  realize that Israel has not the capacity to make or break us 
                  in the region. As Ayatollah Khomeini so felicitously put it, 
                  we alone are "the Great Satan." We sink or swim by whether the 
                  United States can project indomitable power, thus banishing 
                  bin Laden's depiction of us as spoiled and bereft of staying 
                  power. <BR><BR>The coming war with Saddam Hussein's 
                  Iraq--whether we have the wisdom and tenacity to crush the 
                  Baathist regime and patiently replace it with some kind of 
                  liberal, democratic order philosophically inimical to the 
                  regimes in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iran--will decide our fate 
                  in the Middle East. The war on terrorism, like the Gulf War, 
                  will just be a prelude to more wars unless we begin in earnest 
                  the daunting effort to aid Muslims to live in societies free 
                  of holy warriors and despots. But if we do try to help them 
                  enjoy what we consider our birthright--and President Bush's 
                  assertion that we will was the most arresting, promising, and 
                  revolutionary part of his "axis of evil" speech--the Muslim 
                  allies the administration seems so scared of losing will 
                  surely abandon us anyway. <BR><BR>As the Israeli-Palestinian 
                  conflict rolls on and America prepares for war against Iraq, 
                  the administration should perhaps consider the advice of the 
                  11th-century theologian Ibn Hazm: <BR><BR>"He who befriends 
                  and advances friend and foe alike will only arouse distaste 
                  for his friendship and contempt for his enmity. He will earn 
                  the scorn of his enemy and facilitate his hostile designs; he 
                  will lose his friend, who will join the ranks of his enemies." 
                  <BR><BR>Ibn Hazm's counsel converted into policy means that 
                  Washington should tell Egypt and Saudi Arabia that Israel's 
                  right to respond to terrorism is unquestioned and that we are 
                  going to war against Iraq. They are either with us or against 
                  us. The theologian, a redoubtable man, would also tell the 
                  Mubarak family to keep its hands off the American University 
                  of Cairo. <BR><BR><BR>Reuel Marc Gerecht is a resident fellow
