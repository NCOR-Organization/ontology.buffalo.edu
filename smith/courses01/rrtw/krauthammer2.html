                  THE ANTI-HEGEMONIC ALLIANCE <BR><BR>On September 11, our 
                  holiday from history came to an abrupt end. Not just in the 
                  trivial sense that the United States finally learned the 
                  meaning of physical vulnerability. And not just in the sense 
                  that our illusions about the permanence of the post-Cold War 
                  peace were shattered. <BR><BR>We were living an even greater 
                  anomaly. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 
                  1990s, and the emergence of the United States as the 
                  undisputed world hegemon, the inevitable did not happen. 
                  Throughout the three and a half centuries of the modern state 
                  system, whenever a hegemonic power has emerged, a coalition of 
                  weaker powers has inevitably arisen to counter it. When 
                  Napoleonic France reached for European hegemony, an opposing 
                  coalition of Britain, Prussia, Russia, and Austria emerged to 
                  stop it. Similarly during Germany's two great reaches for 
                  empire in the 20th century. It is an iron law: History abhors 
                  hegemony. Yet for a decade, the decade of the unipolar moment, 
                  there was no challenge to the United States anywhere. 
                  <BR><BR>The expected anti-American Great Power coalition never 
                  materialized. Russia and China flirted with the idea 
                  repeatedly, but never consummated the deal. Their summits 
                  would issue communiqu s denouncing hegemony, unipolarity, and 
                  other euphemisms for American dominance. But they were 
                  unlikely allies from the start. Each had more to gain from its 
                  relations with America than from the other. It was 
                  particularly hard to see why Russia would risk building up a 
                  more populous and prosperous next-door neighbor with regional 
                  ambitions that would ultimately threaten Russia itself. 
                  <BR><BR>The other candidate for anti-hegemonic opposition was 
                  a truncated Russia picking up pieces of the far-flung former 
                  Soviet empire. There were occasional feints in that direction, 
                  with trips by Russian leaders to former allies like Cuba, 
                  Iraq, even North Korea. But for the Russians this was even 
                  more a losing proposition than during their first go-round in 
                  the Cold War when both the Soviet Union and the satellites had 
                  more to offer each other than they do today. <BR><BR>With no 
                  countervailing coalition emerging, American hegemony had no 
                  serious challenge. That moment lasted precisely ten years, 
                  beginning with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 
                  1991. It is now over. The challenge, long-awaited, 
                  &nbsp;finally declared itself on September 11 when the radical 
                  Islamic movement opened its worldwide war with a, literally, 
                  spectacular attack on the American homeland. Amazingly, 
                  however, this anti-hegemonic alliance includes not a single 
                  Great Power. It includes hardly any states at all, other than 
                  hostage-accomplice Afghanistan. <BR><BR>That is the good news. 
                  The bad news is that because it is a sub-state infiltrative 
                  entity, the al Qaeda network and its related terrorists around 
                  the world lack an address. And a fixed address -- the locus of 
                  any retaliation -- is necessary for effective deterrence. 
                  Moreover, with the covert support of some rogue regimes, this 
                  terrorist network commands unconventional weapons and 
                  unconventional tactics, and is fueled by a radicalism and a 
                  suicidal fanaticism that one does not normally associate with 
                  adversary states. <BR><BR>This radicalism and fanaticism 
                  anchored in religious ideology only increased our shocked 
                  surprise. We had given ourselves to believe that after the 
                  success of our classic encounters with fascism and Nazism, 
                  then communism, the great ideological struggles were finished. 
                  This was the meaning of Francis Fukuyama's End of History. 
                  There would, of course, be the usual depredations, invasions, 
                  aggressions, &nbsp;and simple land grabs of time immemorial. 
                  But the truly world-historical struggles were over. The West 
                  had won. Modernization was the way. No great idea would arise 
                  to challenge it. <BR><BR>Radical Islam is not yet a great 
                  idea, but it is a dangerous one. And on September 11, it 
                  arose. <BR><BR><BR><BR>II. THE AMERICAN MIND <BR><BR>It took 
                  only a few hours for elite thinking about U.S. foreign policy 
                  to totally reorient itself, waking with a jolt from a 
                  decade-long slumber. During the 1990s, American foreign policy 
                  became more utopian and divorced from reality than at any time 
                  since our last postwar holiday from history in the 1920s. The 
                  liberal internationalists of the Clinton era could not quite 
                  match the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact abolishing war forever for 
                  sheer cosmic stupidity. But they tried hard. And they came 
                  close. <BR><BR>Guided by the vision of an autonomous, active, 
                  and norm-driven "international community" that would relieve a 
                  unilateralist America from keeping order in the world, the 
                  Clinton administration spent eight years signing one treaty, 
                  convention, and international protocol after another. From 
                  this web of mutual obligations, a new and vital "international 
                  community" would ultimately regulate international relations 
                  and keep the peace. This would, of course, come at the expense 
                  of American power. But for those brought up to distrust, and 
                  at times detest, American power, this diminution of dominance 
                  was a bonus. <BR><BR>To understand the utter bankruptcy of 
                  this approach, one needs but a single word: anthrax. The 1972 
                  Biological Weapons Convention sits, with the ABM treaty and 
                  the Chemical Weapons Convention, in the pantheon of arms 
                  control. We now know that its signing marks the acceleration 
                  of the Soviet bioweapons program, of which the 1979 anthrax 
                  accident at a secret laboratory at Sverdlovsk was massive 
                  evidence, largely ignored. It was not until the fall of the 
                  Soviet Union that the vast extent of that bioweapons program 
                  was acknowledged. But that -- and the post-Gulf War evidence 
                  that Iraq, another treaty signatory in good standing, had been 
                  building huge stores of bioweapons -- made little impression 
                  on the liberal-internationalist faithful. Just before 
                  September 11, a serious debate was actually about to break out 
                  in Congress about the Bush administration's decision to reject 
                  the biological weapons treaty's new, and particularly useless, 
                  "enforcement" protocol that the Clinton administration had 
                  embraced. <BR><BR>After the apocalypse, there are no 
                  believers. The Democrats who yesterday were touting 
                  international law as the tool to fight bioterrorism are today 
                  dodging anthrax spores in their own offices. The very idea of 
                  safety-in-parchment is risible. When war breaks out, even 
                  treaty advocates take to the foxholes. (The Bush 
                  administration is trying to get like-minded countries to sign 
                  onto an agreement to prevent individuals from getting easy 
                  access to the substrates of bioweapons. That is perfectly 
                  reasonable. And it is totally different from having some kind 
                  of universal enforcement bureaucracy going around the world 
                  checking biolabs, which would have zero effect on the bad 
                  guys. They hide everything.) <BR><BR>This decade-long folly -- 
                  a foreign policy of norms rather than of national interest -- 
                  is over. The exclamation mark came with our urgent 
                  post-September 11 scurrying to Pakistan and India to shore up 
                  relations for the fight with Afghanistan. Those relations 
                  needed shoring up because of U.S. treatment of India and 
                  Pakistan after their 1998 nuclear tests. Because they had 
                  violated the universal nonproliferation "norm," the United 
                  States automatically imposed sanctions, blocking international 
                  lending and aid, and banning military sales. The potential 
                  warming of relations with India after the death of its Cold 
                  War Soviet alliance was put on hold. And traditionally strong 
                  U.S.-Pakistani relations were cooled as a show of displeasure. 
                  After September 11, reality once again set in, and such 
                  refined nonsense was instantly put aside. <BR><BR>This foreign 
                  policy of norms turned out to be not just useless but 
                  profoundly damaging. During those eight Clinton years, while 
                  the United States was engaged in (literally) paperwork, the 
                  enemy was planning and arming, burrowing deep into America, 
                  preparing for war. <BR><BR>When war broke out, eyes opened. 
                  You no longer hear that the real issue for American foreign 
                  policy is global warming, the internal combustion engine, drug 
                  traffic, AIDS, or any of the other transnational trendies of 
                  the '90s. On September 11, American foreign policy acquired 
                  seriousness. It also acquired a new organizing principle: We 
                  have an enemy, radical Islam; it is a global opponent of 
                  worldwide reach, armed with an idea, and with the tactics, 
                  weapons, and ruthlessness necessary to take on the world's 
                  hegemon; and its defeat is our supreme national objective, as 
                  overriding a necessity as were the defeats of fascism and 
                  Soviet communism. <BR><BR>That organizing principle was 
                  enunciated by President Bush in his historic address to 
                  Congress. From that day forth, American foreign policy would 
                  define itself -- and define friend and foe -- according to who 
                  was with us or against us in the war on terrorism. This is the 
                  self-proclaimed Bush doctrine -- the Truman doctrine with 
                  radical Islam replacing Soviet communism. The Bush doctrine 
                  marks the restoration of the intellectual and conceptual 
                  simplicity that many, including our last president, wistfully 
                  (and hypocritically) said they missed about the Cold War. 
                  Henry Kissinger's latest book, brilliant though it is, 
                  published shortly before September 11, is unfortunately titled 
                  Does America Need a Foreign Policy? Not only do we know that 
                  it does. We know what it is. <BR><BR><BR><BR>III. THE NEW 
                  WORLD ORDER <BR><BR>The post-September 11 realignments in the 
                  international system have been swift and tectonic. Within 
                  days, two Great Powers that had confusedly fumbled their way 
                  through the period of unchallenged American hegemony in the 
                  1990s began to move dramatically. A third, while not altering 
                  its commitments, mollified its militancy. The movement was all 
                  in one direction: toward alignment with the United States. The 
                  three powers in question -- India, Russia, and China -- have 
                  one thing in common: They all border Islam, and all face their 
                  own radical Islamic challenges. <BR><BR>First to embrace the 
                  United States was India, a rising superpower, nuclear-armed, 
                  economically vibrant, democratic, and soon to be the world's 
                  most populous state. For half a century since Nehru's 
                  declaration of nonalignment, India had defined itself 
                  internationally in opposition to the United States. As one of 
                  the founders in 1955 of the nonaligned movement at Bandung, 
                  India helped define nonalignment as anti-American. Indeed, for 
                  reasons of regional politics (Pakistan's relations with China 
                  and with the United States) as well as ideology, India aligned 
                  itself firmly with the Soviet Union. <BR><BR>That began to 
                  fade with the end of the Cold War, and over time relations 
                  with the United States might have come to full flower. 
                  Nonetheless, September 11 made the transition instantaneous. 
                  India, facing its own Taliban-related terrorism in Kashmir, 
                  immediately invited the United States to use not just its 
                  airspace but its military bases for the campaign in 
                  Afghanistan. The Nehru era had ended in a flash. Nonalignment 
                  was dead. India had openly declared itself ready to join Pax 
                  Americana. <BR><BR>The transformation of Russian foreign 
                  policy has been more subtle but, in the long run, perhaps even 
                  more far-reaching. It was symbolized by the announcement on 
                  October 17 that after 37 years Russia was closing its massive 
                  listening post at Lourdes, Cuba. Lourdes was one of the last 
                  remaining symbols both of Soviet global ambitions and of 
                  reflexive anti-Americanism. <BR><BR>Now, leaving Lourdes is no 
                  miracle. It would likely have happened anyway. It is a $200 
                  million a year luxury at a time when the Russian military is 
                  starving. But taken together with the simultaneously reported 
                  Russian decision to leave Cam Ranh Bay (the former U.S. Naval 
                  base in South Vietnam, leased rent-free in 1979 for 25 years), 
                  it signaled a new orientation of Russian policy. On his trip 
                  to European Union headquarters in early October, President 
                  Vladimir Putin made clear that he sees Russia's future with 
                  the West -- and that he wants the West to see its future 
                  including Russia. <BR><BR>This shift is tactical for now. 
                  America needs help in the Afghan war. Russia can provide it. 
                  It retains great influence over the "-stans," the former 
                  Soviet Central Asian republics. From their side, the Russians 
                  need hands off their own Islamic problem in Chechnya. Putin 
                  came to deal. In Brussels, he not only relaxed his opposition 
                  to NATO's expansion to the borders of Russia, not only 
                  signaled his willingness to compromise with the United States 
                  on missile defense, but broadly hinted that Russia should in 
                  essence become part of NATO. <BR><BR>Were this movement to 
                  develop and deepen, to become strategic and permanent, it 
                  could become one of the great revolutions in world affairs. 
                  For 300 years since Peter the Great, Russia has been unable to 
                  decide whether it belongs east or west. But in a world 
                  realigned to face the challenge of radical Islam, it is hard 
                  to see why Russia could not, in principle, be part of the 
                  West. With the Soviet ideology abandoned, Russia's grievances 
                  against the West are reduced to the standard clash of 
                  geopolitical ambitions. But just as France and Germany and 
                  Britain have learned to harmonize their old geopolitical 
                  rivalries within a Western structure, there is no reason 
                  Russia could not. <BR><BR>Cam Ranh Bay and Lourdes signal 
                  Russia's renunciation of global ambitions. What remain are 
                  Russia's regional ambitions -- to protect the integrity of the 
                  Russian state itself, and to command a sphere of influence 
                  including its heavily Islamic "near abroad." For the first 
                  decade of the post-Cold War era, we showed little sympathy for 
                  the first of these goals and none for the second. We looked 
                  with suspicion on Russia's reassertion of hegemony over 
                  once-Soviet space. The great fight over Caspian oil, for 
                  example, was intended to ensure that no pipeline went through 
                  Russia (or Iran), lest Russia end up wielding too much 
                  regional power. <BR><BR>That day may be over. Today we welcome 
                  Russia as a regional power, particularly in Islamic Central 
                  Asia. With the United States and Russia facing a similar enemy 
                  -- the radical Islamic threat is more virulent towards America 
                  but more proximate to Russia -- Russia finds us far more 
                  accommodating to its aspirations in the region. The United 
                  States would not mind if Moscow once again gained hegemony in 
                  Central Asia. Indeed, we would be delighted to give it back 
                  Afghanistan -- except that Russia (and Afghanistan) would 
                  decline the honor. But American recognition of the legitimacy 
                  of Russian Great Power status in Central Asia is clearly part 
                  of the tacit bargain in the U.S.-Russian realignment. Russian 
                  accommodation to &nbsp;NATO expansion is the other part. The 
                  Afghan campaign marks the first stage of a new, and quite 
                  possibly historic, rapprochement between Russia and the West. 
                  <BR><BR>The third and most reluctant player in the realignment 
                  game is China. China is the least directly threatened by 
                  radical Islam. It has no Chechnya or Kashmir. But it does have 
                  simmering Islamic discontent in its western provinces. It is 
                  sympathetic to any attempt to tame radical Islam because of 
                  the long-term threat it poses to Chinese unity. At the just 
                  completed Shanghai Summit, China was noticeably more 
                  accommodating than usual to the United States. It is still no 
                  ally, and still sees us, correctly, as standing in the way of 
                  its aspirations to hegemony in the western Pacific. 
                  Nonetheless, the notion of China's becoming the nidus for a 
                  new anti-American coalition is dead. At least for now. There 
                  is no Russian junior partner to play. &nbsp;Pakistan, which 
                  has thrown in with the United States, will not play either. 
                  And there is no real point. For the foreseeable future, the 
                  energies of the West will be directed against a common enemy. 
                  China's posture of sympathetic neutrality is thus a passive 
                  plus: It means that not a single Great Power on the planet 
                  lies on the wrong side of the new divide. This is historically 
                  unprecedented. Call it hyper-unipolarity. And for the United 
                  States, it is potentially a great gain. <BR><BR>With Latin 
                  America and sub-Saharan Africa on the sidelines, the one 
                  region still in play -- indeed the prize in the new Great Game 
                  -- is the Islamic world. It is obviously divided on the 
                  question of jihad against the infidel. Bin Laden still speaks 
                  for a minority. The religious parties in Pakistan, for 
                  example, in the past decade never got more than 5 percent of 
                  the vote combined. But bin Ladenism clearly has support in the 
                  Islamic "street." True, the street has long been overrated. 
                  During the Gulf War, it was utterly silent and utterly 
                  passive. Nonetheless, after five years of ceaseless agitation 
                  through Al Jazeera, and after yet another decade of failed 
                  repressive governance, the street is more radicalized and more 
                  potentially mobilizable. For now, the corrupt ruling Arab 
                  elites have largely lined up with the United States, at least 
                  on paper. But their holding power against the radical Islamic 
                  challenge is not absolute. The war on terrorism, and in 
                  particular the Afghan war, will be decisive in determining in 
                  whose camp the Islamic world will end up: ours -- that of the 
                  United States, the West, Russia, India -- or Osama bin 
                  Laden's. <BR><BR><BR><BR>IV. THE WAR <BR><BR>The asymmetry is 
                  almost comical. The whole world against one man. If in the end 
                  the United States, backed by every Great Power, cannot succeed 
                  in defeating some cave dwellers in the most backward country 
                  on earth, then the entire structure of world stability, which 
                  rests ultimately on the pacifying deterrent effect of American 
                  power, will be fatally threatened. <BR><BR>Which is why so 
                  much hinges on the success of the war on terrorism. Initially, 
                  success need not be defined globally. No one expects a quick 
                  victory over an entrenched and shadowy worldwide network. 
                  Success does, however, mean demonstrating that the United 
                  States has the will and power to enforce the Bush doctrine 
                  that governments will be held accountable for the terrorists 
                  they harbor. Success therefore requires making an example of 
                  the Taliban. Getting Osama is not the immediate goal. Everyone 
                  understands that it is hard, even for a superpower, to go on a 
                  cave-to-cave manhunt. Toppling regimes is another matter. For 
                  the Taliban to hold off the United States is an astounding 
                  triumph. Every day that they remain in place is a rebuke to 
                  American power. Indeed, as the war drags on, their renown, 
                  particularly in the Islamic world, will only grow. 
                  <BR><BR>After September 11, the world awaited the show of 
                  American might. If that show fails, then the list of countries 
                  lining up on the other side of the new divide will grow. This 
                  is particularly true of the Arab world with its small, fragile 
                  states. Weaker states invariably seek to join coalitions of 
                  the strong. For obvious reasons of safety, they go with those 
                  who appear to be the winners. (Great Powers, on the other 
                  hand, tend to support coalitions of the weak as a way to 
                  create equilibrium. Thus Britain was forever balancing power 
                  on the Continent by supporting coalitions of the weak against 
                  a succession of would-be hegemons.) Jordan is the classic 
                  example. Whenever there is a conflict, it tries to decide who 
                  is going to win, and joins that side. In the Gulf War, it 
                  first decided wrong, then switched to rejoin the American 
                  side. That was not out of affection for Washington. It was 
                  cold realpolitik. The improbable pro-American Gulf War 
                  coalition managed to include such traditional American 
                  adversaries as Syria because of an accurate Syrian calculation 
                  of who could overawe the region. <BR><BR>The Arab states 
                  played both sides against the middle during the Cold War, 
                  often abruptly changing sides (e.g., Egypt during the '60s and 
                  '70s). They lined up with the United States against Iraq at 
                  the peak of American unipolarity at the beginning of the 
                  1990s. But with subsequent American weakness and irresolution, 
                  in the face both of post-Gulf War Iraqi defiance and of 
                  repeated terrorist attacks that garnered the most feckless 
                  American military responses, respect for American power 
                  declined. Inevitably, the pro-American coalition fell apart. 
                  <BR><BR>The current pro-American coalition will fall apart 
                  even more quickly if the Taliban prove a match for the United 
                  States. Contrary to the current delusion that the Islamic 
                  states will respond to American demonstrations of 
                  solicitousness and sensitivity (such as a halt in the fighting 
                  during Ramadan), they are waiting to see the success of 
                  American power before irrevocably committing themselves. The 
                  future of Islamic and Arab allegiance will depend on whether 
                  the Taliban are brought to grief. <BR><BR>The assumption after 
                  September 11 was that an aroused America will win. If we 
                  demonstrate that we cannot win, no coalition with moderate 
                  Arabs will long survive. But much more depends on our success 
                  than just the allegiance of that last piece of the 
                  geopolitical puzzle, the Islamic world. The entire new world 
                  alignment is at stake. <BR><BR>States line up with more 
                  powerful states not out of love but out of fear. And respect. 
                  The fear of radical Islam has created a new, almost 
                  unprecedented coalition of interests among the Great Powers. 
                  But that coalition of fear is held together also by respect 
                  for American power and its ability to provide safety under the 
                  American umbrella. Should we succeed in the war on terrorism, 
                  first in Afghanistan, we will be cementing the New World Order 
                  -- the expansion of the American sphere of peace to include 
                  Russia and India (with a more neutral China) -- just now 
                  beginning to take shape. Should we fail, it will be sauve qui 
                  peut. Other countries -- and not just our new allies but even 
                  our old allies in Europe -- will seek their separate peace. If 
                  the guarantor of world peace for the last half century cannot 
                  succeed in a war of self-defense against Afghanistan(!), then 
                  the whole post-World War II structure -- open borders, open 
                  trade, open seas, open societies -- will begin to unravel. 
                  <BR><BR>The first President Bush sought to establish a New 
                  World Order. He failed, in part because he allowed himself to 
                  lose a war he had just won. The second President Bush never 
                  sought a New World Order. It was handed to him on Sept. 11. To 
                  maintain it, however, he has a war to win. <BR><BR><BR>Charles
