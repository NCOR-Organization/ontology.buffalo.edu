      <P>Morality and Contemporary Warfare. </B>By James Turner Johnson. <I>Yale 
      University Press. 259 pp. $25.</P></I>
      <P>The average person has every reason to approach somewhat skeptically 
      books with titles like <I>Morality and Contemporary Warfare</I>.<I> 
      </I>And one should not be supposed "anti&ndash;intellectual" if that skepticism 
      extends, in particular, to books written by professors of religion and 
      published by an elite academic press.<I> </I>All too often books and 
      articles from the ethics and religious studies guild are morally 
      self&ndash;referential, irrelevant to all except those in the guild, and next to 
      worthless to policy makers who have to decide whether to go to war and 
      soldiers who have to do the fighting.</P>
      <P>This book, I&rsquo;m happy to say, is exempt from such criticism&mdash;no surprise 
      to those familiar with James Turner Johnson&rsquo;s work. The blurb on the book 
      jacket says, "Johnson is one of our most important thinkers on the ethics 
      of war." But that is a too modest evaluation. Johnson&rsquo;s scholarly 
      contributions to our understanding of the theological and secular roots 
      and historical development of the just war idea, his application of that 
      tradition to contemporary problems, and his criticism of its modifications 
      and distortions leave him without peer.</P>
      <P>Johnson has visited this territory before: his earliest books, 
      <I>Ideology, Reason, and the Limitation of War </I>(1975), <I>Just War 
      Tradition and the Restraint of War</I> (1981), and <I>The Quest for 
      Peace</I> (1987), taken together, constitute the most thorough discussion 
      of the sources and historical development of the just war tradition. From 
      the beginning, his work placed contemporary issues in international 
      politics and military developments within that centuries&ndash;old tradition, 
      without ignoring modern writers such as Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Ramsey, and 
      Michael Walzer. The current book continues a long&ndash;running argument with 
      the U.S. National Council of Catholic Bishops (NCCB). In its 1983 
      statement <I>The Challenge of Peace,</I> the NCCB repeatedly asserted that 
      just war doctrine begins with a presumption against war. Not so, said 
      Johnson in <I>Can Modern War Be Just?</I> (1984), an argument against what 
      is variously described as "just&ndash;war pacifism," "modern&ndash;war pacifism," 
      "crypto&ndash;pacifism," or the "presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war" interpretation of the 
      just war tradition.</P>
      <P>The concept of just war, Johnson argues, does not begin with a 
      "presumption against war" focused on the harm war may do, but with a 
      presumption against <I>injustice</I> focused on the need for responsible 
      use of force in response to wrongdoing. Force, according to the core 
      meaning of the just war tradition, is a neutral instrument that can be 
      good or evil depending on the use to which it is put. Indeed the set of 
      criteria classified under <I>jus ad bellum</I>&mdash;justification for military 
      action&mdash;does nothing else than specify the terms under which those in 
      political power are authorized to resort to force. The 
      presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war position of the NCCB, Johnson insists, is simply 
      not to be found in classic just war teaching, "even in the specifically 
      churchly theorists Augustine and Aquinas to whom Catholic just war 
      theorists generally refer for authority." Rather, it owes its origin more 
      to the influence of modern Catholic pacifists; a preoccupation with the 
      particular issues posed by the threat of nuclear war; the debates over 
      American involvement in Vietnam; an underappreciation of the state system 
      of international relations; and an overly optimistic evaluation of the 
      United Nations.</P>
      <P>The presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war position, Johnson argues, introduces a 
      certain perverse logic into moral reflection on the use of military force, 
      one that helps us account for the irrelevance of much academic and 
      ecclesiastical teaching on the ethics of war. The resort to military force 
      in just war tradition has historically come to be defined through seven 
      moral concepts: just cause, competent authority, right intention, 
      reasonable hope of success, last resort, the goal of peace, and overall 
      proportionality of good over harm. However, both historically (including 
      the writings of Augustine and Aquinas and the early&ndash;modern natural law 
      theorists) and in terms of the inner logic of the just war idea, the 
      criteria are not all of equal importance: just cause, competent authority, 
      and right intention have priority. In the classical view, military force 
      is thought of as one tool among several with which statesmen pursue 
      political goods; each of these three guiding criteria, then, is tied to a 
      particular political goodauthority to the good of <I>order</I>, right 
      intention to <I>peace</I>, just cause to <I>justice</I>. The remaining 
      concerns are not unimportant and must be taken seriously. However, being 
      prudential tests, they "are of a qualitatively different character from 
      the deontological criteria" of the first three.</P>
      <P>The presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war position inverts the priority, so that 
      prudential criteria such as reasonable chance of success and last resort 
      (probably the least helpful of the criteria) often are presented at the 
      center of the tradition. Johnson calls this "a serious distortion."</P>
      <P>Here, I think, one can locate the reason why even the antirealist 
      should be skeptical of much of the counsel coming from academic ethicists. 
      The idealism of the presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war position tends to undercut the 
      very purpose of just war reflection, which, as Johnson argues, "is not 
      properly understood as a collection of abstract moral ideals, alien to 
      political judgments or military thinking and imposed from the outside. By 
      its very nature, the just war approach to the ethics of the use of force 
      is already in dialogue with the spheres of statecraft and military 
      affairs." Just war reasoning belongs to, properly resides with, statesmen 
      and military commanders when they consider the use of military force. If 
      the mere <I>use</I> of military force is conceived in the first instance 
      as the problem to which <I>avoidance</I> is the solution, then just war 
      reasoning tends to be reduced to little more than a moralistic checklist 
      brought in externally, as it were, to the task of statecraft.</P>
      <P>Johnson&rsquo;s analysis explains, I think, the rather maddening spectacle in 
      recent years of having theologians&mdash;including pacifists and some 
      crypto&ndash;pacifists&mdash;who know virtually nothing of military strategy, 
      doctrine, force structure, and capability holding forth confidently on the 
      likely or unlikely success of a military operation, or about the 
      preference of economic sanctions to military force. The statesmen and 
      military experts who must make responsible moral judgments quickly dismiss 
      such moralistic posturing. Johnson&rsquo;s analysis also accounts, I think, for 
      the annoying assertion that pacifists and just warriors share a common 
      core commitment to military force as a "last resort," the only purported 
      difference being that pacifists believe a last resort can <I>never</I> be 
      met (as if that were a minor difference!).</P>
      <P>Military personnel who want to act responsibly are often frustrated by 
      the subtle distinction between understanding the tradition as a 
      "presumption against <I>injustice</I>" and understanding it as a 
      "presumption against <I>war</I>." A large part of Johnson&rsquo;s burden is to 
      show that the distinction matters and it matters profoundly on important 
      issues of contemporary statecraft and modern warfighting. The distinction 
      matters, Johnson insists, because the presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war 
      understanding of the tradition&mdash;overly influenced as it was by problems 
      unique to a bipolar Cold War&mdash;can provide little moral guidance for 
      statesmen who must deal with the challenges of a post&ndash;Cold War world. This 
      book seeks to remedy that state of affairs by bringing the classic just 
      war analysis to bear on current debates such as the following: the use of 
      military force for humanitarian relief across sovereign borders; the 
      direct and intentional targeting of entire groups of noncombatants in 
      warfare (including ethnic cleansing and genocide); the influence on 
      conflict of major cultural differences (the "clash of civilizations" 
      thesis); and internationally sanctioned war crimes proceedings and 
      reconciliation after conflict.</P>
      <P>Johnson does not buy the argument, shared by actual and putative war 
      criminals and by many modern&ndash;war pacifists, that the very idea of 
      noncombatancy, and hence the <I>jus in bello</I> principle of 
      discrimination, is irrelevant either because the complex interconnected 
      nature of modern society blurs the combatant/noncombatant distinction or 
      because the destructiveness of modern weapons renders talk of 
      discrimination meaningless. He thus provides a helpful study of war 
      against refugees in the Rwandan&ndash;Zaire war and the Serbian war against 
      cities and "safe havens" in Bosnia.</P>
      <P>Johnson focuses on these two cases precisely because neither involved 
      weapons that were inherently indiscriminate (mostly knives, bayonets, and 
      bullets&mdash;and he should have added artillery in the case of Bosnia) but 
      became indiscriminate when the combatants made the choice to use them 
      indiscriminately. He also suggests that the modern&ndash;war pacifist&rsquo;s 
      assumption that modern war and contemporary weapons are so inherently 
      nondiscriminatory that traditional <I>jus in bello </I>restraints no 
      longer apply tends to become a self&ndash;fulfilling prophecy.</P>
      <P>Most illuminating is his discussion of the strategy of siege warfare 
      conducted by Serbian forces in Bosnia. Johnson notes that apart from a 
      discussion in Michael Walzer&rsquo;s <I>Just and Unjust Wars</I>, very little 
      has been written on the morality of siege warfare. Johnson takes up that 
      task and, drawing on Walzer, suggests that a siege constitutes warfare 
      against noncombatants in two cases: first, if the besieged place is 
      surrounded on all sides such that noncombatants are deprived of the chance 
      to leave; second, if the besiegers choose methods that affect 
      noncombatants directly or intentionally or that are disproportionately 
      destructive, even if they are unable to close the ring around the city. 
      The Roman siege of Jerusalem exemplifies the first case, the siege of 
      Sarajevo the second, and the Serbian sieges of Bosnian "safe havens" has 
      elements of both.</P>
      <P>In his chapter on "Conflict and Cultural Difference," Johnson tries to 
      steer a middle course between a "realist" model of cultural conflict and 
      Samuel Huntington&rsquo;s "clash of civilizations" thesis. The former does not 
      sufficiently appreciate the cultural values and ideals that lead to 
      specific conflicts. But the latter exaggerates the adverse effects of 
      cultural difference and minimizes common factors, so that it fails to take 
      into account those resources within the cultural traditions for the 
      mitigation and avoidance of conflicts. Thus, in a most illuminating, and, 
      I suspect, most controversial section of the chapter, Johnson takes great 
      pains to show that there are inherent limitations on the conduct of war in 
      Islamic culture. Jihad is war for the sake of religion, but, according to 
      Johnson, "its religious purpose does not translate into license to fight 
      total war against all enemies of the Muslim faith." Muslims who take their 
      faith seriously are to observe restraints imposed by the Prophet Muhammad 
      himself and by jurists interpreting the meaning of the Prophet&rsquo;s 
      permissions and prohibitions. The position, argues Johnson, is clear: 
      "There is no justification for war directed intentionally against 
      noncombatants in jihad."</P>
      <P>In his chapter "War Crimes and Reconciliation," Johnson takes note of a 
      dilemma. On the one hand, a genuine lasting peace with justice requires 
      that atrocities be dealt with. On the other hand, the cooperation of those 
      responsible for atrocious conduct seems necessary for a minimal peace 
      between the conflicting parties. This dilemma has led to two well&ndash;formed 
      opposing constituencies on the issue of international war crimes 
      proceedings. Those defending such proceedings tend to be international 
      lawyers and criminal justice specialists and those involved in monitoring 
      and enforcing compliance with international humanitarian law. Those 
      opposed adopt a "no&ndash;fault" approach to conflict resolution, which is 
      usually favored by the diplomatic community, conflict&ndash;resolution 
      professionals, and non&ndash;governmental organizations engaged in providing 
      relief and other services. Johnson&rsquo;s just war convictions lead him to an 
      unequivocal position:</P>
      <DIR>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>As one whose professional career has focused on the 
        development and restraints on the initiation of war and the conduct of 
        war, and one who, moreover, holds the deepest moral justification for 
        use of armed force in the service of justice, I clearly belong among the 
        constituency supporting war crimes proceedings. From my perspective, 
        shaped by thinking of morality and war in just war terms, egregious 
        violations of the rights of people caught up in a conflict constitute an 
        injustice that is immoral not to seek to remedy.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>
      <P>Here again, Johnson frames the issue as a contest between classic just 
      war theory and the presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war position. Logically, the latter 
      will tend to side with the no&ndash;fault conflict resolution position since it 
      sees conflict per se as the problem to which mere cessation of hostilities 
      is the solution. But to refuse to prosecute war crimes, Johnson argues, 
      undermines the protection of human rights by removing from consideration 
      the idea of "crimes against humanity." Such proceedings assist also in 
      reestablishing the rule of law, an essential step in the reconstitution of 
      a civil society torn by conflict.</P>
      <P>However, the most fundamental problem with the no&ndash;fault approach to 
      conflict resolution is that it implies that future warfare by atrocity 
      will also go unpunished, thus undermining the tradition&rsquo;s goal of a just 
      and ordered peace (Augustine&rsquo;s <I>tranquillitas ordinis). </I>It is 
      important to recognize, Johnson says, "that the way a war is fought and 
      the purpose at which it aims, including the peace that is sought for the 
      end of the conflict, are not unrelated, whether in practical or moral 
      terms." If you doubt that, reflect on the lingering memory of Sherman&rsquo;s 
      march to the sea, the impact it had on reconciling North and South, and 
      how that has affected race relations in America.</P>
      <P>Particularly helpful is Johnson&rsquo;s discussion of the highly contentious 
      issue of "humanitarian intervention." He persuasively argues that the 
      classic understanding of just cause permits the use of military force for 
      humanitarian intervention across sovereign borders. After the Peace of 
      Westphalia, the idea of just cause was narrowed in positive international 
      law to establishing defense, either by one nation or a coalition of 
      nations, as the only justifying cause for use of force. Of course, this 
      would, by definition, rule out intervention across sovereign borders.</P>
      <P>Classically, however, the <I>jus ad bellum</I> requirement of just 
      cause meant one or more of three possibilities: that the use of force was 
      for defense against wrongful attack, for retaking something wrongly taken, 
      or for punishment of evil. This premodern understanding of just cause 
      would give greater latitude to states, coalitions of states, or even a 
      single state acting unilaterally to prevent egregious violations of human 
      rights and uphold fundamental international norms. Thus, Johnson suggests 
      that the very recent erosion in customary international law of the 
      traditional rule against intervention across state borders (and of 
      absolute state sovereignty) is more in keeping with the traditional notion 
      of just cause. In cases of rampant evil and injustice there is a moral 
      obligation to intervene, subject to a certain prudential caution given to 
      the obligations to other political goods, including obligations to the 
      international order, to the political communities of intervening states, 
      and to members of the society targeted for intervention.</P>
      <P>On the issue of intervention, Johnson has a sympathetic assessment of 
      the NCCB&rsquo;s 1993 statement <I>The Harvest of Justice is Sown in Peace</I>, 
      which also insists on an obligation to intervene. He points out, however, 
      how this stands in fundamental tension with the presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war 
      position adopted by the bishops in <I>The Challenge of Peace</I>. Those 
      adhering to the presumption&ndash;against&ndash;war position embedded in <I>The 
      Challenge of Peace</I> logically would have to resist the broader and 
      classical understanding of just cause (they want fewer, not more, reasons 
      for using military force), and yet an expansive understanding is required 
      to justify the purported obligation to intervene as expressed in <I>The 
      Harvest of Justice</I>. While there was no major section in <I>The 
      Challenge of Peace</I> on the use of armed force for the promotion of 
      justice, <I>The Harvest of Justice</I> specifically listed Haiti, Bosnia, 
      Liberia, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, and Burundi as particular conflicts where 
      intervention was an obligation of the international community.</P>
      <P>So the bishops seem to want it both ways. One can&rsquo;t help but think that 
      the inconsistency between these statements is more the result of ad hoc 
      reactions to contemporary issues and an attempt to placate Catholic 
      pacifists than the result of careful reflection on the tradition. In fact, 
      I tend to think Johnson is too charitable in calling this a "tension." A 
      "tension" so fundamental is really a contradiction.</P>
      <P>Unlike most who are sympathetic to the weakening of state sovereignty 
      and inclined to defend humanitarian intervention, Johnson is not taken 
      with the role of the United Nations. In classic terms, the <I>jus ad 
      bellum</I> requirement of proper authority limits the right to authorize 
      force to sovereign political entities, that is, those with no superior. 
      However, international authorization for military intervention is now 
      often claimed on the basis of consensus, as in United Nations Security 
      Counsel resolutions, rather than on the basis of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Johnson argues that moral thought, including Catholic moral thought, 
      over the last quarter century has been unduly shaped by a belief in the 
      inherent "militarism and venality of states." Modern&ndash;war pacifists, he 
      observes, have been fond of quoting John XXIII&rsquo;s <I>Pacem in Terris</I> as 
      a minimalist defense of their position: "In this age which boasts of 
      atomic power, it makes no sense to maintain that war is a fit instrument 
      with which to repair the violation of justice." During the Cold War, the 
      United Nations was not subject to the same moral reproach and was held up 
      as transcending the failures of modern states. Because the UN could 
      authorize military force only in peacekeeping operations and because the 
      forces were always small and lightly armed and the resort to them 
      infrequent, the UN was largely insulated from the criticisms of modern war 
      directed at the military establishments of powerful states. Not 
      surprisingly, after the Cold War the UN became the institution of choice 
      for intervention and a way for modern&ndash;war pacifists to transcend the 
      "militarism and venality of states." Military forces, with the moral and 
      political approval of the United Nations, could now be embraced in defense 
      of human rights.</P>
      <P>This moral vision, however, failed to take adequate account of the fact 
      that real power was not located in the international organization, but 
      with individual states and coalitions of states. It tended to ignore the 
      differences in the way specific states were constituted (what George 
      Weigel has called "the regime factor") and the implications that these 
      differences have for the just resort to and restraint of war. In short, it 
      tended to overlook the fact that the structure of order defined through 
      the UN was not one that could stand alone, but depended on viable 
      states.</P>
      <P>While the end of the Cold War set the UN free to act in accord with its 
      Charter, including the right to intervene by force in conflicts where no 
      peace had yet been established (e.g., Somalia and Bosnia), this new 
      freedom highlighted the fundamental limits of the UN as an international 
      organization: "It lacks in itself the attributes necessary to make it 
      capable of effectively acting out this role stipulated in the 
Charter."</P>
      <P>It lacks cohesion, for example, so that its policies and decisions are 
      not consistent from conflict to conflict. It lacks sovereignty, depending 
      on agreements among its sovereign member states. It lacks an effective 
      chain of command for military forces it may place in the midst of an 
      ongoing conflict, so these forces cannot be an effective arm of 
      international statecraft. All these absent features are necessary 
      characteristics of the state as a political institution, and their absence 
      at once shows the limits of the role of the United Nations and the 
      continuing importance of states in the international system.</P>
      <P>All these deficiencies, Johnson perceptively observes, "are first and 
      foremost defects in sovereign authority." And since, according to the just 
      war tradition, "without such authority there is no entity competent to 
      determine just cause and undertake military action on its behalf, this 
      lack means that the United Nations as an institution cannot have <I>jus ad 
      bellum</I> in the fundamental just war sense." Conversely, viable states 
      possess what the United Nations does not: "competent authority to 
      formulate policies and reach decisions regarding the just use of force, to 
      exercise command over such force, and to assess their rights and 
      responsibilities relative to ongoing conflicts." That should be a word of 
      caution to all those who reflexively think a UN Security Council 
      Resolution is morally necessary before a multilateral or even a unilateral 
      military action can be just. A study of the failure of the UN inspection 
      regime in Iraq would, I suspect, supplement and bolster Johnson&rsquo;s case on 
      this point.</P>
      <P>As Johnson realizes, this book will hardly be persuasive to political 
      realists who will accuse him of going too far in taking account of moral 
      concerns and international standards and values. The position he defends 
      will also seem to be an immoral loosening of the strictures against the 
      use of force by traditional pacifists and modern&ndash;war pacifists who 
      continue to regard states "as incurably venal and all uses of force in the 
      modern era as disproportionately destructive." But, as he insists, 
      "between these two perspectives is precisely the territory of just war 
      tradition, an understanding of statecraft in which the use of armed force 
      in the service of justice is both permitted and restrained."</P>
      <P>Johnson has ably defended and applied the classic just war tradition 
      against contemporary modifications and distortions. This is practical 
      moral philosophy and theology at its best. </P>
