<P><SPAN class=dropcap>W</SPAN>hen "Ibn Warraq," the pseudonymous Muslim 
apostate, visited the United States after September 11, one of his first stops 
was the White House. There, he enjoyed an hour-and-a-half lunch with President 
Bush's chief economic speechwriter, David Frum. Though Warraq confirms the 
meeting and has told supporters about it, Frum refuses to discuss it "in any 
way," perhaps because it suggests that some in the administration just don't buy 
the president's claim that Islam is a "peaceful" religion. Warraq has made a 
name for himself (and lost the one he was born with) by becoming Islam's most 
outspoken critic. 
<P>His controversial 1995 book <I>Why I Am Not a Muslim</I> makes Salman 
Rushdie's <I>The Satanic Verses</I> look like bush-league blasphemy. A dense 
treatise modeled after Bertrand Russell's famous 1927 essay "Why I Am Not a 
Christian," the work presents a strident historical, moral, and philosophical 
indictment of Islam and advocates not just a firm separation of mosque and state 
but outright atheism. 
<P>It's also enjoying a vibrant second life. Since the World Trade Center 
massacre, <I>Why I Am Not a Muslim</I> has shot onto Amazon.com's top-25 list of 
titles on Islam. Traditionally, U.S. liberals have shown far more interest in 
creating secular societies, but much of the interest in Warraq comes from the 
political right--from the ideological allies of Franklin Graham, the Christian 
evangelist who recently dubbed Islam a "very evil and wicked religion"; and from 
conservative, pro-Israeli Jews like Frum and Daniel Pipes, director of the 
Middle East Forum, who wrote a piece in <I>The Weekly Standard</I> in 1996 
calling Warraq's book a "quite brilliant...indictment of one of the world's 
great religions." 
<P>WorldNetDaily.com--a Web site that runs columns from Ann Coulter and Pat 
Buchanan and articles with titles such as "Jesus Says Pack Heat...The Bible and 
self-defense"--now sells <I>Why I Am Not a Muslim</I> through its catalog. The 
irony of fundamentalist Christians purchasing this atheistic tome is not lost on 
Warraq, who comments, "The Christian right will find my book extremely 
embarrassing." Indeed, he makes a similar point in the book: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An Algerian friend, a well-educated Muslim...came across Russell's 
  "Why I Am Not a Christian" while looking through my books. He pounced on it 
  with evident glee. As I learned later, he apparently considered Russell's 
  classic to be a great blow to Christianity; at no time was my friend aware 
  that Russell's arguments applied, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>, to 
Islam.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><SPAN class=dropcap>I</SPAN>n person, Ibn Warraq seems an unlikely candidate 
to become Islam's Tom Paine. His previous occupations include teaching primary 
school, working as a tour guide, and running a restaurant; he freely confesses, 
"I really do not wish to spend my life being a professional Islam basher." I 
first met Warraq two years ago in Amherst, New York, while working for <I>Free 
Inquiry</I> and <I>Skeptical Inquirer</I> magazines. (Although my boss at the 
time, Paul Kurtz, separately runs Prometheus Books, Warraq's publisher, I have 
never worked for Prometheus.) When I next saw him, again in Amherst, last 
November, he was convening a meeting of anti-Muslim dissidents from Iran, 
Bangladesh, and other Islamic countries. Many of the attendees came across as 
starkly angry ("My target is to get rid of Islam," huffed the Iranian-born 
activist Parvin Darabi) and more than a little paranoid (the group held a long 
discussion on how to prevent Muslims from secretly infiltrating their ranks). 
Warraq seemed by far the most moderate, courtly, and conciliatory person 
present. 
<P>Admittedly, some dispute this description. Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on 
American-Islamic Relations says that he has only skimmed Warraq's <I>Why I Am 
Not a Muslim,</I> but observes: "The fact that his book is being promoted by 
hate-mongers is interesting." And it's true that Warraq occasionally takes a 
taunting tone. But at more than 400 pages of mostly airless prose, <I>Why I Am 
Not a Muslim</I> is predominantly argument. As for ad hominems, Warraq remarks 
at the book's outset that, following the Rushdie affair, the Muslim world needs 
to learn to live with such unfettered speech and asserts his "right to criticize 
everything and anything in Islam--even to blaspheme, to make errors, to 
satirize, and mock." 
<P>Those in most Western countries have the right to criticize their predominant 
religion (Christianity) in a way that those in Muslim countries don't; this 
stems in part from the tradition of religious dissent that ushered in the 
Protestant Reformation and continues to inform Christian scholarly revision. 
Andrew Rippin, a Koran specialist who is dean of the faculty of humanities at 
the University of Victoria in Canada, says that "what some people call the 
Reformation in Islam, the counterpart to the Christian Reformation--that hasn't 
occurred yet." Warraq and his ilk hope that such a Reformation will draw fuel 
from the work of Islamic revisionists (inspired by the British expert John 
Wansbrough), who today find themselves in the delicate position of asserting 
that the Koran--which Muslims claim to be the infallible word of God--is 
actually a mishmash of oral traditions that evolved over several centuries. 
<P>Not all revisionists see themselves as Warraq's allies. One scholar has 
called his book "religious polemic masquerading as scholarship" and worried that 
it would "raise suspicions among some Muslims that all revisionist scholarship 
is motivated by intolerance." 
<P>Yet Warraq's basic critique, which finds something fundamentally (though 
perhaps not uniquely) intolerant about doctrinal Islam--rendering it inimical to 
women's rights, freedom of thought and expression, and other modern 
liberties--does not differ so starkly from the views expressed by Bernard Lewis, 
the Princeton Islam guru, in his now-canonical 1990 <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> 
essay "The Roots of Muslim Rage." Traditional Muslims believe that their duty is 
to bring all unbelievers to Islam, explains Lewis: "Islam was never prepared, 
either in theory or in practice, to accord full equality to those who held other 
beliefs and practiced other forms of worship." 
<P><SPAN class=dropcap><B>S</B></SPAN><B>o why has Warraq been embraced by the 
political right in this country rather than the civil-rights-conscious left? 
</B>
<P><B>Warraq contends that because of the work of Edward Said and other 
theorists, the American left has "been scared of being called colonialists and 
imperialists" and so has adopted a guilt-ridden shyness about Islam. Yet 
liberals in other Western countries have been more open to his views: Warraq has 
recently contributed a commentary to the left-leaning British newspaper <I>The 
Guardian</I>; in October, Australia's Radio National devoted an entire Religion 
Report program to interviewing him. As one Islamic historian put it, "At least 
until September 11, the place where it was the most difficult to criticize Islam 
was in America." </B>
<P><B>But if the American left is confused or afraid, Christian conservatives 
are sowing a whirlwind by circulating Warraq's atheist tract. 
</B>WorldNetDaily.com's editor and CEO, Joseph Farah, admits that when it comes 
to those Christians who buy <I>Why I Am Not a Muslim</I> through his site, "I 
wouldn't be surprised if some of them are shocked." The secularization and 
reformation of Islam, after all, will hardly yield many Christian converts. 
<P>Religion thrives in the United States largely because of church-state 
separation; Islam in particular has benefited through this openness. Ibn 
Warraq's critique, says Rippin, leaves open the door for a "modernist Muslim 
thought, the same as within Christianity." Grappling with a book like <I>Why I 
Am Not a Muslim</I> may not only make Islam more tolerant--it could make it 
stronger. </P></DIV></DIV><BR clear=all>
