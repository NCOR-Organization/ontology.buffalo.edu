<p>Understanding Islam </p>
<p>THE ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON </p>
<p>for Constructive and Noble Goals </p>
<p>By Dr. Labib Mikhail </p>
<p>The barbaric, horrific terrorist attacks on Tuesday, September 11, 2001
on  the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, DC
have  caused every American to ask why did it happen? Who did it? And why
do they hate  us? </p>
<p>The investigation of the CIA and FBI has concluded that the attackers
were  Muslims. Does that mean that every Muslim is a terrorist? By no means.
There are  many decent Muslims. But while many news commentators and politicians
are  proclaiming that Islam is a peace-loving religion, others are warning
of Islamic  Jihad, or Holy War. </p>
<p>These conflicting descriptions of Islam can be explained by examining
the  three types of Muslims: Secularists, Moderates, and Fundamentalists.
The Koran,  the holy book of Islam, is used by each group to justify their
way of thinking. </p>
<p>THREE TYPES OF MUSLIMS </p>
<p><b>Secularists</b> are Muslims who do not have a knowledge of the contents
of  the Koran and only know a verse or two to justify enjoying their life
such as:  "Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world"
(Surat Al-Kahf  18:46). </p>
<p><b>Moderates</b> know the Koran but seek to make their faith relevant
to  modern life. They try to reconcile the contradicting verses in the Koran
in such  a way that Muslims may tolerate Jews and Christians living among
them. They  emphasize the verses that came to the Prophet Muhammad when he
was weak  militarily and in need of the support of Jews and Christians. These
verses which  are kind to Jews and Christians are: "So, if you (Muhammad)
are in doubt  concerning that which We have revealed unto you then ask these
who are reading  the Book (the Torah and the Injeel [Gospel]) before you.
Verily the truth has  come to you from thy Lord. So be not of those who doubt"
(Surat Yunus 10:94). </p>
<p>"Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers
 (Muslims) the Jews and those who are Al-Mushrikun, and you will find the
nearest  in love to the believers (Muslims) those who say: 'We are Christians.'
That is  because amongst them are priests and monks, and they are not proud"
(Surat  Al-Maidah 5:82). </p>
<p>Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians,
 whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds
shall  have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall
they  grieve" (Surat Al-Baqarah 2:62). </p>
<p>Barnabas Fund in England wrote: The Muslim Prophet Muhammad, the founder
of  Islam, was a complex character whose attitudes and opinions changed and
evolved  during his lifetime in response to events around him. It is not
surprising to  find that Islam is a complex faith." </p>
<p>When needed, Muslim clerics use Koranic verses including those kind to
Jews  and Christians to paint a glowing picture of Islam as a religion of
peace,  brotherhood, modesty, morality, self-discipline and family values.
But, the true  face of Islam is revealed in the Koranic verses calling Muslims
to "Jihad,"  which means holy war against all non-Muslims. We will quote
again from the  article by Barnabas Fund. "It is true that many individual
Muslims are peace  loving and law-abiding. But, it is not true that peace
is the main  characteristic of the faith of Islam." </p>
<p><b>Fundamentalists</b> are those who want to apply the more extreme verses
of  the Koran to the letter. These verses came to Muhammad after he was strong
 militarily and after he realized that the Christians and Jews were not becoming
 followers of his new religion. Muhammad's anger in the following Koranic
verses,  which abrogate the nice verses in the Koran, is the root of violence
which  saturates and captures the minds of these fundamentalist Muslims: </p>
<p>The Prophet Muhammad urges Muslims to fight in the cause of Allah "O prophet
 Muhammad urge the believers (Muslims) to fight" (Surat Al-Anfal 8:65). "Jihad
 (holy fighting in Allah's cause) is ordained for you" (Surat Al-Baqarah
2:216). </p>
<p>The Koran commands Muslims not to befriend Jews or Christians "O ye who
 believe (Muslims) take not the Jews or the Christians for your friends and
 protectors. They are but friends and protectors to each other. And he among
you  that turns to them (for friendship) is of them" (Surat Al-Maidah 5:51). 
</p>
<p>The Koran commands Muslims to fight Jews and Christians' Fight against
those  who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which
has been  forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) and those who acknowledge
not  the religion of truth (Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews
and  Christians) until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel
 themselves subdued" (Surah At-Taubah 9:29). </p>
<p>Jizyah is a special high tax to be paid only by Jews or Christians who
do not  want to renounce their religion and convert to Islam.  </p>
<p>The Koran commands Muslims to fight non-Muslims until they exterminate
all  other religions and Islam would be the only religion in the world. "And
fight  them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others
along  with Allah) and (all and every kind of) worship is for Allah (alone).
But if  they cease, let there be no transgression except against As-Zatimun
(the  polytheists and wrong doers)" (Surat Al-Baqarah 2:193). </p>
<p>This verse is mentioned also in Surat Al-Anfal 8:39. Because of the  misunderstanding
and ignorance of Christianity, Muslims believe that Christians  are polytheists,
because they believe in a Triune God. Fundamentalists look at  Jews and Christians
and all non-Muslims as infidels who must be killed because  they have no
value as human beings and must be exterminated from the face of the  earth. 
</p>
<p>Fundamentalists divide the world into two camps, Dar Al-Harb (Camp of
war)  where Jews and Christians live, and Dar Al-Sallam (Camp of peace) where
Muslims  live. They believe that Holy war against those who live in the camp
of war  should continue until they are exterminated. </p>
<p>Fundamentalists dream of a global Islamic empire. They believe that if
they  destroy America and the western countries, that they will achieve this
dream. </p>
<p><b>The Koran declares that Muslims who fight and die in battle are promised
 forgiveness and a sensual luxurious life in Paradise. "And if you are killed
or  die in the Way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better
than  all that they amass (of worldly wealth)" (Surat Al-Imran 3:157). "Verily,
Allah  has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for
(the price)  that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in Allah's Cause,
so they kill  (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is
binding on Him"  (Surat At-Taubah 9:111).</b> </p>
<p>What can martyrs expect in paradise? The Koran describes life in paradise
in  the following words<b> "Eat and drink with happiness because of what
you used to  do. They will recline (with ease) on thrones arranged in ranks.
And We shall  marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes. And
We shall provide  them with fruit and meat such as they desire" (Surat At-Tur
52:17-20,22).</b> </p>
<p><b>"Water flowing constantly and fruit in plenty whose supply is not cut
off  and reclining on couches raised high, verily we have created them (women)
of  special creation and made them virgins of equal age" (Surat Al-Waqiah
 56:31-37).</b> </p>
<p><b>"Gardens and vineyards and young full-breasted virgins of equal age
and a  full cup of wine" (Surat An-Naba 78:32-34).</b> </p>
<p><b>Some prominent Muslim clerics call the suicide bombers martyrs because
in  the Koran, a martyr is guaranteed total forgiveness of his sins and eternal
life  in paradise where he can drink wine and will be married to a great
number of  beautiful sensual virgins. While in fact, these martyrs are nothing
more than  murderers.</b> </p>
<p>Nineteen educated Muslims committed suicide and killed thousands of innocent
 men, women and children in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the
four  planes they flew on that black Tuesday. Those nineteen Muslims did
that because  of their deep conviction that they will go directly to paradise
to enjoy sensual  pleasures, and because of their terrible hatred for America;
a country populated  by a Christian majority. </p>
<p>Muhammad Atta, who flew the first plane into the World Trade Center, was
a  devout Muslim. He was born in Egypt to a lawyer and was a highly intelligent
 person who communicated with ease with children, old men, professors and
people  in government. As a student in Germany he was known to be quiet,
and very  religious. Atta regularly prayed on the floor of his office and
founded an  Islamic prayer and study group at the University in January 1999. 
</p>
<p>Atta lived and moved easily in Western society while secretly hating it.
He  was a man on a mission and on the front of his thesis, presented in October
 1999, he wrote the following verse from the Koran: "My Prayer and my sacrifice
 and my life and my death belong to Allah, the Lord of the worlds" (Washington
 Post 09/22/01). The West needs to know that many other Muhammad Attas may
 quietly be living amongst us. </p>
<p>The Koran commands Muslims to terrorize and torture and kill anyone who
 disobeys Allah and the Prophet Muhammad: "(Remember) when your Lord revealed
to  the angels, "Verily I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed.
I will  cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike
them over  the necks and smite over all their fingers and toes. This is because
they defied  and disobeyed Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad). And whoever
defies and  disobeys Allah and His Messenger, them verily, Allah is Severe
in punishment.  This is (the torment), so taste it; and surely, for the disbelievers
is the  torment of the Fire" (Surat Al-Anfal 8:12-14). </p>
<p>"The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger
 (Muhammad) and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed
or  crucified or their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides, or
be exiled  from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great
torment is  theirs in the Hereafter" (Surat Al-Maidah 5:33).  </p>
<p>The Koran declares that Allah loves those who fight in His cause. "Verily,
 Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in rows as if they were solid  structures"
(Surat As-Saff 61:4). </p>
<p>The Koran commands Muslims to convert non-Muslims to Islam by force. "Kill
 the Mushrikun (polytheists, Christians and non-Muslims), wherever you find
them,  and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each
and every  ambush. But, if they repent and perform As-salat (public prayer
with Muslims)  and give Zakat (Islamic alms), then leave their way free.
Allah is  oft-forgiving, most merciful" (Surat At-Taubah 9:5). </p>
<p>Mathematician Blas Pascal who lived in 1670 said, "Men never do evil so
 completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction."
The  heart of man is naturally evil. You can ignite that evil with religious
 gasoline. The Koran's verses ignited that evil in the hearts of those terrorists
 and will ignite evil in many more Muslims' hearts. </p>
<p>While violence committed by militant Muslims is sanctioned and commanded
by  the Koran, any atrocities committed by Christians were never sanctioned
by the  New Testament commandments. For Jesus Christ commanded His apostle
Peter, "Put  your sword in its place. For all who take the sword will perish
by the sword"  (Matthew 26:52). </p>
<p>FREEDOM OF THOUGHT IN ISLAM </p>
<p>Islam is a prison with no way out. Once a person enters that prison, he
 cannot leave it alive. "Then what is the matter with you that you are divided
 into two parties about the apostates? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief)
 because of what they have earned. Do you want to guide him whom Allah has
made  to go astray? And he whom Allah has made to go astray, you will never
find for  him any way (of guidance). They wish that you reject Faith, as
they have  rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one
another). So take  not Aouliya (protectors or friends) from them, till they
emigrate in the Way of  Allah (to Muhammad). But if they turn back (from
Islam), take (hold of) them and  kill them wherever you find them, and take
neither Aouliya (protectors or  friends) nor helpers from them" (Surat An-Nisa
4:88,89). </p>
<p>This verse means that if a person says the Islamic Shahada (creed): "I
 testify that there is no God but Allah, I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger
 of Allah," he cannot change his mind. If he does change his mind, he will
be  executed or beheaded as has happened many times in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan,
 and other Islamic countries. </p>
<p>Islam is a religion of intellectual censorship. In Islam the democratic
right  to free thought and individual decision concerning religious matters
is totally  denied. We have more than one example of that intellectual censorship. 
</p>
<p>The first is Salman Rushdie. Salman Rushdie was born to a Muslim family
in  Bombay but has spent much of his life in London, England. He wrote a
book  entitled The Satanic Verses. Muslims thought this book was an insult
to the  Prophet Muhammad and Islam so Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini issued an
order to  assassinate Rushdie and promised $5 million to the one whom would
kill him.  Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader at that time, said in a statement
read for him  on the radio in 1989: "Anyone who died attempting to kill Rushdie,
he promised,  would go straight to paradise." </p>
<p>The second is Dr. Farag Foda, the great author who was assassinated in
Cairo,  Egypt in 1993 because he wrote many books exposing the true face
of Islam and  Islamic society. He was accused of being an apostate Muslim
and was shot and  killed in front of his son. </p>
<p>The third is Professor Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid, who was accused of being an
 apostate Muslim because of his books about the Koran. The court in Egypt
ruled  that he must divorce his wife, Ibtihal Younes. He fled from Egypt
and is now  living with his wife in Holland. </p>
<p>The fourth is the well-known Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz, who became
the  first Egyptian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Muslims stabbed
him in  front of his house in an attempt to kill him. The man is over 80
years old. They  wanted to kill him because they thought that he insulted
Muhammad in his novel,  "The Children of Gabalawi." </p>
<p>It is of great importance for any American or any secular Muslim to know
what  kind of society he or she will live in if fundamentalist Muslims rule.
The  Taliban, Afghanistan's ruling Islamic movement, is an example of this
extremist  militant faith, which is based on a literal interpretation of
the Koran, and it  shows in their way of life. </p>
<p>In Afghanistan any woman who will show more than her eyes will be flogged.
In  Saudi Arabia, a woman is banned from driving a car or from walking down
the  street without covering all of her body except for her eyes. </p>
<p>Christians who went to Afghanistan to help the poor and the sick with
food  and medicine were arrested and jailed because they had Bibles and Christian
 cassette tapes. In Saudi Arabia Christians are banned from holding worship
 services let alone building a church. In the meantime, Muslims are taking
 advantage of the American freedom and building hundreds of mosques on American
 soil.  </p>
<p>In Sudan more than one million Christians were killed by the Islamic  government
in Khartoum. In Algeria, thousands of Muslims were slaughtered by  militant
Muslims with no regard for life. </p>
<p>Today we are hearing on radio and television many Muslim clerics saying
that  Islam means peace. But the word Islam means "submission" and a Muslim
is one who  is in submission to Allah. Their goal as stated in the Koran
is to bring the  entire world into submission to Allah and the Koran and
have a global Islamic  empire.  </p>
<p>The author has written more than 60 books and hundreds of articles on
Islam  and Christianity in both Arabic and English. He has produced or been
a guest of  many radio and television programs. He holds a doctorate in Theology
and has  pastored Evangelical churches in the Middle East and America. </p>
