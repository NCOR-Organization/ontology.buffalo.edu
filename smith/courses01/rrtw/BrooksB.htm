                  1830, a group of French artists and intellectuals looked 
                  around and noticed that people who were their spiritual 
                  inferiors were running the world. Suddenly a large crowd of 
                  merchants, managers, and traders were making lots of money, 
                  living in the big houses, and holding the key posts. They had 
                  none of the high style of the aristocracy, or even the earthy 
                  integrity of the peasants. Instead, they were gross. They were 
                  vulgar materialists, shallow conformists, and self-absorbed 
                  philistines, who half the time failed even to acknowledge 
                  their moral and spiritual inferiority to the artists and 
                  intellectuals. What's more, it was their very mediocrity that 
                  accounted for their success. Through some screw-up in the 
                  great scheme of the universe, their narrow-minded greed had 
                  brought them vast wealth, unstoppable power, and growing 
                  social prestige. <BR><BR>Naturally, the artists and 
                  intellectuals were outraged. Hatred of the bourgeoisie became 
                  the official emotion of the French intelligentsia. Stendhal 
                  said traders and merchants made him want to "weep and vomit at 
                  the same time." Flaubert thought they were "plodding and 
                  avaricious." Hatred of the bourgeoisie, he wrote, "is the 
                  beginning of all virtue." He signed his letters 
                  "Bourgeoisophobus" to show how much he despised "stupid 
                  grocers and their ilk." <BR><BR>Of all the great creeds of the 
                  19th century, pretty much the only one still thriving is this 
                  one, bourgeoisophobia. Marxism is dead. Freudianism is dead. 
                  Social Darwinism is dead, along with all those theories about 
                  racial purity that grew up around it. But the emotions and 
                  reactions that Flaubert, Stendhal, and all the others 
                  articulated in the 1830s are still with us, bigger than ever. 
                  In fact, bourgeoisophobia, which has flowered variously and 
                  spread to places as diverse as Baghdad, Ramallah, and Beijing, 
                  is the major reactionary creed of our age. <BR><BR>This is 
                  because today, in much of the world's eyes, two peoples--the 
                  Americans and the Jews--have emerged as the great exemplars of 
                  undeserved success. Americans and Israelis, in this view, are 
                  the money-mad molochs of the earth, the vulgarizers of morals, 
                  corrupters of culture, and proselytizers of idolatrous values. 
                  These two nations, it is said, practice conquest capitalism, 
                  overrunning poorer nations and exploiting weaker neighbors in 
                  their endless desire for more and more. These two peoples, the 
                  Americans and the Jews, in the view of the bourgeoisophobes, 
                  thrive precisely because they are spiritually stunted. It is 
                  their obliviousness to the holy things in life, their feverish 
                  energy, their injustice, their shallow pursuit of power and 
                  gain, that allow them to build fortunes, construct weapons, 
                  and play the role of hyperpower. <BR><BR>And so just as the 
                  French intellectuals of the 1830s rose up to despise the 
                  traders and bankers, certain people today rise up to shock, 
                  humiliate, and dream of destroying America and Israel. Today's 
                  bourgeoisophobes burn with the same sense of unjust 
                  inferiority. They experience the same humiliation because 
                  there is nothing they can do to thwart the growing might of 
                  their enemies. They rage and rage. Only today's 
                  bourgeoisophobes are not just artists and intellectuals. They 
                  are as likely to be terrorists and suicide bombers. They teach 
                  in madrassas, where they are careful not to instruct their 
                  students in the sort of practical knowledge that dominates 
                  bourgeois schools. They are Muslim clerics who incite hatred 
                  and violence. They are erudite Europeans who burn with 
                  humiliation because they know, deep down, that both America 
                  and Israel possess a vitality and heroism that their nations 
                  once had but no longer do. <BR><BR>Today the battle lines are 
                  forming. The dispute over Palestine, which was once a local 
                  conflict about land, has been transformed into a great 
                  cultural showdown. The vast array of bourgeoisophobes--Yasser 
                  Arafat's guerrilla socialists, Hamas's Islamic 
                  fundamentalists, Jose Bove's anti-globalist leftists, 
                  America's anti-colonial multiculturalists, and the BBC's 
                  Oxbridge mediacrats--focus their diverse rages and resentments 
                  on this one conflict. <BR><BR>The bourgeoisophobes have no 
                  politburo. There is no bourgeoisophobe central command. They 
                  have no plausible strategy for victory. They have only their 
                  nihilistic rage, their envy mixed with snobbery, their snide 
                  remarks, their newspaper distortions, their conspiracy 
                  theories, their suicide bombs and terror attacks--and above 
                  all, a burning sense that the rising, vibrant, and powerful 
                  peoples of America and Israel must be humiliated and brought 
                  low. <BR><BR><BR><BR>BOURGEOISOPHOBIA is really a hatred of 
                  success. It is a hatred held by people who feel they are 
                  spiritually superior but who find themselves economically, 
                  politically, and socially outranked. They conclude that the 
                  world is diseased, that it rewards the wrong values, the wrong 
                  people, and the wrong abilities. They become cynical if they 
                  are soft inside, violent if they are hard. In the 
                  bourgeoisophobe's mind, the people and nations that do succeed 
                  are not just slightly vulgar, not just over-compensated, not 
                  just undeservedly lucky. They are monsters, non-human beasts 
                  who, in extreme cases, can be blamelessly killed. This 
                  Manichaean divide between the successful, who are hideous, and 
                  the bourgeoisophobes, who are spiritually pristine, was 
                  established early in the emergence of the creed. The early 
                  19th-century German poet Holderlin couldn't just ignore the 
                  merchant bourgeoisie; he had to declare the middle classes 
                  "deeply incapable of every divine emotion." In other words, 
                  scarcely human. <BR><BR>Holderlin's countryman Werner Sombart 
                  later wrote a quintessential bourgeoisophobe text called 
                  "Traders and Heroes," in which he argued that there are two 
                  basic human types: "The trader approaches life with the 
                  question, what can you give me? . . . The hero approaches life 
                  with the question what can I give you?" The trader, then, is 
                  the selfish capitalist who lives a meager, artificial life 
                  amidst "pocket-watches, newspapers, umbrellas, books, sewage 
                  disposal, politics." The hero is the total man, who is 
                  selfless, vital, spiritual, and free. An honest person might 
                  ascribe another's success to a superior work ethic, 
                  self-discipline, or luck--just being in the right place at the 
                  right time and possessing the right skills. A normal person 
                  might look at a rich and powerful country and try to locate 
                  the source of its vitality, to measure its human and natural 
                  resources, its freedom, its institutions and social norms. But 
                  for the bourgeoisophobe, other people's success is never 
                  legitimate or deserved. To him, success comes to those who 
                  worship the golden calf, the idol, the Satanic corrupter, 
                  gold. <BR><BR>When bourgeoisophobes describe their enemies, 
                  they almost always portray them as money-mad, as crazed 
                  commercialists. And this vulgar materialism, in their view, 
                  has not only corrupted the soul of the bourgeoisie, but 
                  through them threatens to debase civilization itself and the 
                  whole world. It threatens, in the words of the supreme 
                  bourgeoisophobe, Karl Marx, to take all that is holy and make 
                  it profane. <BR><BR>Some of the more pessimistic 
                  bourgeoisophobes come to believe that the worst is already at 
                  hand. "Our poor country lies in Roman decadence," the French 
                  conservative poet Arthur de Gobineau lamented in 1840. "We are 
                  without fiber or moral energy. I no longer believe in 
                  anything. . . . MONEY HAS KILLED EVERYTHING." (A great place 
                  to read bourgeoisophobe writing is Arthur Herman's "The Idea 
                  of Decline in Western History." Bourgeoisophobia is not 
                  Herman's theme, but his book does such a magnificent job of 
                  surveying two centuries of pessimistic thought that most of 
                  the key bourgeoisophobes are quoted.) <BR><BR>And once the 
                  bourgeoisophobes had experienced the basic spasm of reaction, 
                  they soon settled on the Americans and Jews as two of the 
                  chief objects of their ire. Because, as Henry Steele Commager 
                  once noted, no country in the world ever succeeded like 
                  America, and everybody knew it. And no people in the European 
                  experience ever achieved such sustained success as the Jews. 
                  <BR><BR>So the Jews were quickly established in the 
                  bourgeoisophobe imagination as the ultimate commercial people. 
                  They were the bankers, the traders, the soulless and sharp 
                  dealmakers who crawled through the cellars of honest and noble 
                  cultures and infected them with their habits and practices. 
                  The 19th-century Teutonic philosopher Houston Chamberlain said 
                  of the Jews that "their existence is a crime against the holy 
                  laws of life." The Jewish religion, he said, is "rigid," 
                  "scanty," and "sterile." <BR><BR>The American bourgeoisophobe 
                  family, the Adamses, contained more than its share of 
                  anti-Semites. Brooks Adams lamented that "England is as much 
                  governed by the Jews of Berlin, Paris and New York as the 
                  native growth." Adams compared the Jews to a vast syndicate 
                  and declared simply, "They control the world." Henry Adams 
                  protested against the interlocked power of "Wall Street, State 
                  Street and Jerusalem." Later, the English historian Arnold 
                  Toynbee argued that the Jews, with their "consummate 
                  virtuosity in commerce and finance," had infected Western 
                  civilization with a crass materialism. Through their arrogance 
                  and viciousness, they were responsible for capitalism, godless 
                  communism, and the Holocaust, and so had contributed to 
                  Europe's decline. <BR><BR>It's actually amazing how early 
                  America, too, was stereotyped as a money-grubbing commercial 
                  land and Americans a money-grubbing people. Francois La 
                  Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, who traveled in the United States in 
                  the 1790s, declared, "The desire for riches is their ruling 
                  passion." In 1805, a British visitor observed, "All men there 
                  make [money] their pursuit." "Gain! Gain! Gain! Gain! Gain!" 
                  is how the English philosopher Morris Birbeck summarized the 
                  American spirit a few years later. In 1823 William Faux wrote 
                  that "two selfish gods, pleasure and gain, enslave the 
                  Americans." Fourteen years after that, the disillusioned 
                  Russian writer Mikhail Pogodin lamented, "America, on which 
                  our contemporaries have pinned their hopes for a time, has 
                  meanwhile clearly revealed the vices of her illegitimate 
                  birth. She is not a state, but rather a trading company." 
                  <BR><BR>Each wave of foreign observers reinforced the 
                  prejudice. Charles Dickens described a country of uncouth 
                  vulgarians frantically chasing, as he first put it, "the 
                  almighty dollar." Oswald Spengler worried that Germany would 
                  devolve into "soulless America," with its worship of 
                  "technical skill, money and an eye for facts." Matthew Arnold 
                  worried that global forces would Americanize England. "They 
                  will rule [Britain] by their energy but they will deteriorate 
                  it by their low ideas and want of culture." By 1904, people 
                  around the world were worrying about American cultural 
                  hegemony. In that year the German writer Paul Dehns wrote an 
                  influential essay called "The Americanization of the World." 
                  "What is Americanization?" Dehns asked. "Americanization in 
                  its widest sense, including the societal and political, means 
                  the uninterrupted, exclusive, and relentless striving after 
                  gain, riches and influence." <BR><BR>In the 20th century the 
                  Americans' aggressive commercialism was symbolized by the 
                  unstoppable spread of jeans, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Disney, 
                  and Microsoft. America, in the bourgeoisophobes' eyes, is the 
                  land of Bart Simpson, boy bands, boob jobs, and "Baywatch." 
                  The land of money and guns. Of insincere smiles and love 
                  handles. So by the time Osama bin Laden came along, hatred of 
                  America was well rehearsed, a finished product just waiting 
                  for him to pick it up. In 1998 bin Laden declared war on "the 
                  crusader-Jewish alliance, led by the United States and 
                  Israel." He added, "Since I was a boy I have been at war with 
                  and harboring hatred towards the Americans." He was only 
                  echoing Toynbee, who 30 years earlier said, "The United States 
                  and Israel must be today the two most dangerous of the 125 
                  sovereign states among which the land surface of this planet 
                  is at present partitioned." <BR><BR><BR><BR>FOR THE 
                  bourgeoisophobe, then, the question becomes, how does one 
                  confront this menace? And on this, the bourgeoisophobes split 
                  into two schools. One, which might be called the brutalist 
                  school, seeks to reclaim the raw, masculine vitality that 
                  still lies buried at the virile heart of human nature. The 
                  other, which might be called the ethereal school, holds that a 
                  creative minority can rise above prosaic bourgeois life into a 
                  realm of contemplation, feeling, art, sensibility, and 
                  spiritual grace. <BR><BR>The brutalist school started in 
                  Germany, more or less with Nietzsche. In "Thus Spake 
                  Zarathustra," Nietzsche has a character declare that he is 
                  turning his back on the whole world of degenerate 
                  "flea-beetles," the ones who spend their lives "higgling and 
                  haggling for power with the rabble." Salvation instead is 
                  found in the will to power. The Ubermensch possesses force of 
                  will. He can thus be "a mighty . . . hammer" who will smash, 
                  "break and remove degenerate and decaying races to make way 
                  for a new order of life." <BR><BR>The brutalists urged 
                  sons--"the explosive ones"--to revolt against their fathers. 
                  They romanticized insanity as a rebellion against convention. 
                  They looked back nostalgically to the crude, savage, and proud 
                  men of Homeric legend, Germanic history, and Norse myth. They 
                  looked for another such hero to emerge today, a virile warrior 
                  who would demolish the stale encrustations of an overcivilized 
                  world and revive the raw energy of the species. "We do not 
                  need ideologues anymore," Oswald Spengler argued, "we need 
                  hardness, we need fearless skepticism, we need a class of 
                  socialist master men." This, of course, was the path that led 
                  to Mussolini, Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and bin Laden. 
                  <BR><BR>Meanwhile, the ethereal bourgeoisophobes were emerging 
                  in Paris and later London and the United States. They argued 
                  that people in decaying cultures should not try to reclaim 
                  their former economic and military power. It was wiser to 
                  accept the decline of their worldly power and embrace the 
                  contemplative virtues. Toynbee acknowledged that Europe's 
                  virile, self-assertive days were over. Europeans would have to 
                  choose between spending their money on comfortable welfare 
                  states and spending it on militaristic "war-making states." 
                  They could not afford both. He predicted (in 1926) that they 
                  would choose welfare states--and be forced to accept being 
                  "dwarfed by the overseas world which [Europe] herself had 
                  called into existence." <BR><BR>The Europeans should therefore 
                  turn inward. As Arthur Herman notes, the human ideal Toynbee 
                  described looks a lot like Toynbee himself: "diffident, 
                  sensitive, religious in a contemplative and otherworldly 
                  sense, a man who shuns the world of violence and barbarism to 
                  pursue the 'etherealization' of himself and society." Toynbee 
                  denounced patriotism, commercial striving, and the martial 
                  spirit. Artists and intellectuals, the "creative minority," 
                  should lead until "the majority is drilled into following the 
                  minority's lead mechanically." <BR><BR>Though Toynbee despised 
                  the United States, his books sold well here. His lecture tours 
                  were lucrative, and his picture was on the cover of Time 
                  magazine. When Hitler came along, Toynbee was an enthusiastic 
                  appeaser. He met Hitler in 1936 and came away deeply impressed 
                  (the two men hated some of the same things). He told his 
                  countrymen that Hitler sincerely desired peace. For, just as 
                  the brutalist school of bourgeoisophobia led to Hitler and 
                  Saddam, the ethereal school led to Neville Chamberlain and 
                  some of the European reaction to George Bush's Axis of Evil. 
                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, there has been a great 
                  deal of analysis of the roots of Muslim rage. But to anybody 
                  familiar with the history of bourgeoisophobia, it is striking 
                  how comfortably Muslim rage meshes with traditional rage 
                  against meritocratic capitalism. The Islamist fanatic and the 
                  bourgeoisophobe hate the same things. They use the same words, 
                  they utter the same protests. In an essay in the New York 
                  Review of Books called "Occidentalism," Avishai Margalit and 
                  Ian Buruma listed the traits that enrage al Qaeda and other 
                  Third World anti-Americans and anti-Westerners. First, they 
                  hate the city. Cities stand for commerce, mixed populations, 
                  artistic freedom, and sexual license. Second, they hate the 
                  mass media: advertising, television, pop music, and videos. 
                  Third, they hate science and technology--the progress of 
                  technical reason, mechanical efficiency, and material 
                  know-how. Fourth, they hate prudence, the desire to live 
                  safely rather than court death and heroically flirt with 
                  violence. Fifth, they hate liberty, the freedom extended even 
                  to mediocre people. Sixth, they despise the emancipation of 
                  women. As Margalit and Buruma note, "Female emancipation leads 
                  to bourgeois decadence." Women are supposed to stay home and 
                  breed heroic men. When women go out into the world, they 
                  deprive men of their manhood and weaken their virility. 
                  <BR><BR>If you put these six traits together, you have pretty 
                  much the pillars of meritocratic capitalist society, practiced 
                  most assertively in countries like America and Israel. 
                  Contemporary Muslim rage is further inflamed by two additional 
                  passions. One is a sense of sexual shame. A rite of passage 
                  for any bourgeoisophobe of this type is the youthful trip to 
                  America or to the West, where the writer is nearly seduced by 
                  the vulgar hedonism of capitalist life, but heroically spurns 
                  it. Sayyid Qutb, who is one of the intellectual heroes of the 
                  Islamic extremists, toured America between 1948 and 1950. He 
                  found a world of jazz, football, movies, cars, and people 
                  obsessed with lawn maintenance. It was a land, he wrote, 
                  "hollow and full of contradictions, defects and evils." At one 
                  point Qutb found himself at a church social. The disc jockey 
                  put on "Baby, It's Cold Outside." As Qutb wrote, "The dancing 
                  intensified. . . . The hall swarmed with legs. . . . Arms 
                  circled arms, lips met lips, chests met chests, and the 
                  atmosphere was full of love." This was at a church social. You 
                  can imagine how the September 11 al Qaeda hijackers must have 
                  felt during the visit they made to a Florida strip club 
                  shortly before going off to their purifying martyrdom. 
                  <BR><BR>The second inflaming passion is 
                  humiliation--humiliation caused by the fact that in the 1960s 
                  and 1970s, many Arab and Muslim nations tried to join this 
                  bourgeois world. They tried to modernize, and they failed. 
                  Some Arab countries continue to pursue the low and dirty 
                  modernizing path, continue to ape the sordid commercialists 
                  and even to accept the presence of American troops on Arabian 
                  soil. And this drives the hard-core Islamic bourgeoisophobes 
                  to even higher states of rage. As bin Laden himself notably 
                  put it, protesting the presence of American troops on Saudi 
                  land: "By God, Muslim women refuse to be defended by these 
                  American and Jewish prostitutes." The Islamist response to 
                  humiliation has been worship of the Muslim man of force. 
                  Islamist extremists romanticize the brutal warrior, just as 
                  the German bourgeoisophobes did, only the Islamists wear robes 
                  and clutch Korans. Like European and Japanese brutalists 
                  before them, the Islamists celebrate violence and build a cult 
                  of suicide and death. "The Americans love Pepsi-Cola, we love 
                  death," declared al Qaeda's Mualana Inyadullah after 
                  September11. Jews "love life more than any other people, and 
                  they prefer not to die," declared Hamas official Ismail Haniya 
                  on March 28 amidst a rash of suicide bombings. </P></TD></TR>
