      src="The Atlantic  January 2002  The Mullahs and the Postmodernists  Rauch_files/dc-i.gif" 
      width=23 align=left>n October I got an e-mail from a historian I know who 
      teaches at a college in the Northeast. She was gloomy about the terrorist 
      attacks and anxious about the war, but much of her distress stemmed from 
      the reactions of some of the people around her. One of her colleagues had 
      appeared at a teach-in and declared that Americans were the "terrorists," 
      because of their policies in Iraq. Others described the U.S. military 
      action as naked aggression against an innocent, oppressed, and poor 
      population. On another campus nearby she saw a graffito that read, "After 
      Timothy McVeigh did we bomb Michigan?" Such sentiments cast their 
      proponents into an incongruous ideological alliance—not with mainstream 
      campus liberals like my professor friend (she was mystified and appalled) 
      but with radical Muslims on the other side of the world.<BR><BR>There is 
      nothing new about objections from the American left to the exertion of 
      U.S. power abroad. Nor is there necessarily anything wrong with them: on 
      more than one occasion they have been prescient. Yet this time the far 
      left's reaction was strikingly reactionary. If the left seemed as 
      anti-American as it was anti-terrorist, that was because it was in fact 
      anti-everything, offering no program for American self-defense in the face 
      of a direct attack and no substitute for either Western materialism or 
      Islamic fundamentalism. The left failed to be constructive; it managed 
      only to be, excuse the expression, deconstructive. That was disappointing 
      to those who believe, as I do, that a vital and intelligent left wing is 
      an important ingredient of a healthily self-critical society; but it was 
      also clarifying, because it demonstrated the extent to which radical 
      egalitarianism has displaced all other values on the postmodern 
      left.<BR><BR>Radical egalitarianism? How could that explain the bizarre 
      convergence of postmodern Marxists with anti-modern mullahs, who are 
      anything but egalitarian? An underappreciated book by the late Aaron 
      Wildavsky offers an answer.<BR><BR>Wildavsky taught at the University of 
      California at Berkeley for thirty years, until his death, in 1993. He was 
      one of the great political scientists of his generation. I was lucky to 
      know him, and not a day passes when I don't miss his wisdom. That wisdom, 
      infused with an incandescent passion, shines from a collection of essays 
      titled <I><A class=magbodylink 
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1879383012/theatlanticmonthA/" 
      target=outlink>The Rise of Radical Egalitarianism</A></I> 
      (1991).<BR><BR>Wildavsky wrote at the time when "political correctness" 
      had only just burst into full flower on university campuses, and he 
      wondered what lay behind it. He concluded that its many impulses—the 
      impulse to regard all whites as oppressors and all minority members as 
      victims, the impulse to see America as incorrigibly racist and classist 
      and unfair, the impulse to impose admissions and hiring quotas and then 
      lie about them, the impulse to politicize all academic disciplines, the 
      impulse to snuff out dissent—were all aspects of a single controlling 
      imperative. "That common factor," he contended, "is egalitarianism—the 
      belief in the moral virtue of diminishing differences among people of 
      varying incomes, genders, races, sexual preferences, and (especially) 
      power." <BR><BR>Wildavsky got it right. Whereas not long ago the American 
      left was multivalent, valuing freedom, for instance, no less than 
      equality, it now values just one thing. That is what makes radical 
      egalitarianism radical. Even "diversity" has come to mean centrally 
      administered sameness, with portions allotted not to persons but to five 
      or so standardized categories of person. The postmodern left has become as 
      fixated on its one value as the anti-modern mullahs are on 
      theirs.<BR><BR>Were he alive, Wildavsky would have no trouble 
      understanding why two such seemingly opposed groups might join forces 
      against the modern West. In an essay titled "Who Wants What and Why? A 
      Cultural Theory" he sorted political and cultural preferences into three 
      broad categories. Individualistic cultures, he wrote, believe that all is 
      right with the world when people are mainly self-regulating, with 
      decisions made by bidding and bargaining, so that the need for centralized 
      authority is reduced. Hierarchic cultures believe that all is right when 
      each is in his proper place, with particular people or groups making 
      sacrifices for the good of the whole. Egalitarian cultures believe that 
      all is right when everybody's status is the same. <BR><BR>The relevance of 
      Wildavsky's categories today is immediately evident. The American 
      mainstream is predominantly individualistic. Postmodern leftists, in 
      contrast, are radical-egalitarian to the core. With Marxism in ruins, they 
      can offer no viable social system that will reliably produce equal 
      outcomes; yet so fiercely do they burn with egalitarian zeal that they 
      insist more stridently than ever on the unfairness and wickedness of 
      capitalism and materialism. Thus their new turn toward nihilism—toward 
      ideology and action that always protest but never propose, toward 
      suggestions, as in Seattle, in the form of rocks hurled through 
      plate-glass windows.<BR><BR>If the enemy of your enemy is your friend, 
      then it is not so surprising that postmodern Marxists should make common 
      cause with radical mullahs. Islamic fundamentalism is hierarchism 
      incarnate: the world will be a just place when Islamic law is the only 
      law, with Muslims ruling infidels, men ruling women, and God ruling man. 
      Although the radical-Islamic and radical-egalitarian senses of justice 
      could hardly be more different, they are less opposites than counterparts 
      in opposition to the dominance of individualism. If they differ as to 
      ends, they share a sense of grievance at having been humiliated by history 
      and a desire to torment what they see as the smug societies of the 
      West.<BR><BR>The Marxists and the mullahs are natural enemies, as Stalin 
      and Hitler were, and their alliance, such as it is, will prove equally 
      fleeting. But their convergence is as revelatory in today's context as the 
      Hitler-Stalin pact was in 1939, and for much the same reason: it brings 
      two usually opposing pole stars into temporary conjunction, and reminds 
      the rest of us where we stand.<BR><BR><!--ARTICLE CONTENT ENDS--><!--endclickprintinclude--><!--POST & RIPOSTE-->
