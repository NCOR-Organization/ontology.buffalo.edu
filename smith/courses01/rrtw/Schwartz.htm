            size=3>, Arab intellectuals met recently to address their concerns 
            about Islamophobia, a Western fear of Islam. The presumption, as 
            with any "phobia," is that this is a misplaced anxiety which, with 
            proper therapy and appropriate enlightenment can be alleviated. But 
            as an American, a Jew, a secular humanist and an unabashed 
            subscriber to the values of Western Civilization, I must confess to 
            a measure of Islamophobia, and the more I learn of Islamic words – 
            and the deeds they lead to – the less are my fears allayed.

            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Since Sept. 11, 
            I have been told repeatedly by the press and politicians that Islam 
            is a religion of peace but what I see in the news belies these 
            assurances. I would like to be convinced that the evidence before my 
            eyes is an aberration, a distortion of the faith by a few fanatics. 
            But sadly a candid assessment of reality leads me to an opposite 
            conclusion: that a significant segment of the Muslim world wishes 
            me, my values and my society harm and is prepared to undertake or 
            condone violent means to achieve this. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Perhaps I have 
            misperceived the good intentions of Islam, and if so, I welcome the 
            occasion to be reassured. We have heard a great deal recently about 
            why Islam hates America, but we have not heard why so many Americans 
            mistrust Islam – at least the face of it that we’ve seen since Sept. 
            11— and for many, well before. As someone brought up with the givens 
            of respect for all faiths, enthusiasm for pluralism and appreciation 
            for the diversity of all ethnic groups, I find this gnawing 
            Islamophobia at odds with my basic beliefs, but part of the problem 
            is that I do not see them reciprocated by Islam. I find myself 
            increasingly agreeing with the Holocaust survivor who observed: "If 
            someone says they’re going to kill you, believe them.’’ </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>And I have to 
            wonder why the support of Muslim intellectuals, clerics and laymen 
            is so tepid on behalf of our war against terror in Afghanistan, so 
            qualified about depriving Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass 
            destruction and so compromised in their splitting hairs over 
            wrongful terrorism at the World Trade Center and "rightful" 
            terrorism in Israel. I ask myself what other religion would not 
            outright condemn the mass murder of innocent civilians in malls, 
            buses, and restaurants, a slaughter aimed at inflicting the greatest 
            amount of pain, death and injury on its victims. Imagine if the 
            Pope, the Dalai Lama, the Archbishop of Canterbury or the American 
            Board of Rabbis were to rationalize the deliberate massacre of 
            innocent people. They would be decried as moral lepers. This, of 
            course, is unimaginable, except in Islam, where such abominable acts 
            are rationalized as religiously justified. What I find offensive is 
            the air of moral superiority from people who blow up embassies, 
            public buildings, shopping centers, cafes, barracks, and ships. What 
            I find repugnant is the air of grievance from zealots who have given 
            innocents so much to grieve for. So to those intellectuals in Cairo 
            who are concerned about Islamophobia, yes, Islam does have an image 
            problem, based not on the fantasies of the West but the horrendous 
            reality of the acts committed in Islam’s name – which no political 
            agenda or religious millennialism can justify. The problem, I would 
            suggest, is not with the West’s perception, which is all too 
            accurate, but with the behavior of Islamicists. And until a growing 
            number of, until now quite silent, Muslims address this problem, it 
            will continue. Here then are my own reasons for finding it difficult 
            to overcome a growing Islamophobia. I look forward to the day when 
            an enlightened Muslim majority can allay my concerns. But until they 
            do, my Islamic problem – I doubt I am alone – and, more importantly, 
            their Islamic problem won’t go away.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>My greatest 
            concern with the militant face of Islam is the deliberate failure of 
            Muslim leaders to distinguish between ends and means. Whatever the 
            goal – a Palestinian state, a Muslim Kashmir – a test of someone’s 
            allegiance to the principles of tolerance, civility and decency is 
            where they come down on the means to achieve it. Terror – that is, 
            the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians to achieve political 
            goals, is <I>a priori</I> ruled out. A "yes, but,’’ is unacceptable. 
            Political goals must be achieved through political means, 
            negotiation and moral suasion, not through violence, much less 
            violence directed at innocents. There are no mitigating 
            circumstances for terrorism among civilized people. Distorting the 
            meaning of terrorism to turn it on its head and blame the target is 
            an evasion that no longer fools anyone. The dodge of equivalence is 
            also wearing thin. When I read about Palestinians celebrating the 
            deaths of Jews, most just embarking on their lives, in the latest 
            rash of suicide bombings in a ritual that has now become a norm for 
            that society – which is in keeping with Palestinians celebrating the 
            terrorist attack of Sept. 11 despite Arafat’s attempts to squelch 
            reports of them – I must ask myself what kind of culture it is that 
            experiences the deliberate murder of young people or the 
            incineration of 3,500 human beings as a cause for joy? One of the 
            relatives of a suicide bomber was a schoolteacher who evinced pride 
            in the killer’s actions. What does this man teach his students? How 
            poisoned by hatred can such people be that they can find pleasure in 
            such murderous havoc? Is any cause worth such evil and do they 
            really think theirs will be advanced by these tactics, or if not, 
            then do they console themselves with blind vengeance? What kind of 
            culture abets such monstrosity? Images like these fill the mind, and 
            not only at the World Trade Center or in Israel. I think of the 
            Christian survivors huddled in a Pakistani village after a gang of 
            Muslim murderers invaded the church during a service and slaughtered 
            most of the worshipers "in revenge" for the U.S. attack on the 
            Taliban, as if the poor victims had anything to do with the American 
            offensive. I think of the gruesome aftermath of a recent Muslim 
            terrorist bombing in Kashmir that killed 30 people. Perhaps worst of 
            all, I envision the anguished face of a little Filipino girl of 
            about five or six, roped together with a group of other hostages, 
            being herded to an unknown fate by Muslim terrorists during an 
            uprising in the Philippines. What could the young armed Islamic 
            terrorist, prodding his victims onward, be thinking? Is this what 
            Allah requires of him? Will he be rewarded in heaven for this act? 
            Is the prize of 70 virgins worth the terror on this little girl’s 
            face? I have yet to hear voices that represent a significant body of 
            Islam condemn such heinous acts perpetrated on its behalf. What I 
            hear instead are evasions, qualifications, rationales. When 
            confronted with the overwhelming documented slaughter and 
            enslavement of black Christians and animists by Muslim rulers in the 
            Sudan where more than a million people have been killed in the last 
            20 years, a Saudi official blandly dismissed it as untrue. End of 
            discussion. While Muslim apologists from their bully pulpit at Al 
            Jazeera flog the great Satan of the U.S. and the little Satan of 
            Israel as a global menace, it seems to me that wherever terror 
            abounds in the world, well beyond the reach of Americans and Jews, 
            it is Islam – or its worst adherents – that present a much realer 
            global menace than any of its projected enemies. The fact is that 
            there are currently 40 armed conflicts going on in the world and all 
            but two involve Islam. Who is the menace?</FONT></P>

            group of fellow travelers supplying money, logistics, propaganda and 
            muscle. It is fanatic, intolerant of dissent and contemptuous of the 
            very societies whose principles it uses to undermine them. Unlike 
            Communism, it does not have a single headquarters but is a 
            supranational movement, taking advantage of various host entities as 
            the occasion warrants. Its chief venue of organization is not the 
            union hall but the mosque. Just as Communists infiltrated unions in 
            the ‘20s and ‘30s in an attempt to take over organized labor, the 
            Islamists, with financial and logistical help from their Saudi 
            backers, have taken control of mosques throughout the West and 
            elsewhere, as well as seized control of education from the Middle 
            East to Pakistan.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>What people in 
            the West are just beginning to understand is that there is an 
            intimate relationship between the political, the religious and the 
            cultural in Islam. The mosque is not only the prayer house. It is 
            also a political seat. The imam preaching to the faithful can offer 
            a homily not only on the Koran but exhort his listeners to political 
            action – often violent. It is no accident that crowds stirred up by 
            Muslim preachers have gone on rampages, that some of the most 
            hate-filled anti-Western, anti-American and anti-Semitic venom has 
            been preached from the pulpits – including those in Europe and the 
            U.S.A.. Muslim "charity" may just as soon give a portion of its 
            funds to weapons for Al Qaeda as for a hospital. The denial of where 
            the money goes is disingenuous.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Americans 
            presume that our religion does not conflict with our obligations as 
            citizens but, as with Communism, this is not the presumption of 
            Islamism, whose adherents are obedient to a higher loyalty which is 
            inimical to our national interests. To the extent that Islam is a 
            private religion in which man struggles on a spiritual quest to 
            follow the ways of God, it is a great and beautiful faith. But when 
            it becomes political and strident, it can become dangerous, 
            subversive and threatening and, in this public, ideological mode, it 
            cannot hide behind the skirts of religious tolerance.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>The critical 
            difference between Communism and Islam in the West – at least at 
            this stage, is that while the labor movement and the moderate Left 
            eventually united to speak out unequivocally against the Communists, 
            expose their lies and ultimately defeat them, we have yet to see the 
            Muslim Orwell emerge who will stand up to the Islamists. By way of 
            excuse, we are told that clerics fear assassination or losing their 
            power base or being seen as appeasers of the West. But principled 
            men of all faiths have always been willing to run risks to bear 
            witness against evil and we should expect no less from Muslim 
            spiritual leaders. A more likely explanation is that too many of 
            them sympathize with the methods of the terrorists. If the Muslim 
            clerisy lacks the moral strength to confront terror perhaps it must 
            come from the secular ranks. But here too, we find a void. If only a 
            small minority of Muslims support Al Qaeda than why doesn’t the 
            moral majority issue a round denunciation of terrorism – all 
            terrorism – in unequivocal terms. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>The Muslim 
            community has been quite vocal in asserting its civil rights but 
            strangely quiet in supporting the U.S. war effort against a regime 
            that we now see suppressed fellow Muslims. Why? When it comes to 
            standing up for America against a remorseless foe, the Muslim 
            leadership – so vociferous in asserting Palestinian rights – seems 
            to have lost its voice. It may be that in recent years the Islamists 
            have seized the reins of Muslim organizations in this country, 
            achieving what the Communists never succeeded in doing. Currently it 
            appears that they have taken over a good chunk of the mosques, they 
            have commandeered too many of the Muslim student organizations and 
            they have virtually silenced any serious opposition from within the 
            Muslim community. Muslims must ask themselves why is it that they 
            complain (validly) about American support of non-democratic states 
            in Egypt and Saudi Arabia but are silent about non-democratic states 
            in Iraq, Syria and Libya or Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Why do we 
            hear nothing from the American Muslim community about support for 
            the democratic movement in Iran which, despite the oppression of the 
            mullahs, has the support of three-quarters of the nation’s 
            voters?</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>In Europe, 
            there is a virtual hatred of the West preached in mosques from 
            London to Cologne. Why, as an American, a Jew, a Westerner, should I 
            find this reassuring? And why should I be welcoming to the people 
            who preach it, who clearly seek my own physical destruction as well 
            as that of everything I stand for? Must I convert to Islam and have 
            my wife and daughter don chadors in order to appease them? Until I 
            see a widespread movement among American (and hopefully other) 
            Muslims to unequivocally reject the tenets of Islamism – which means 
            ALL forms of violence, no excuse, no justification, no extenuating 
            circumstances, I will mistrust their motives and their disclaimers. 
            At this point, one must choose sides, and qualifications for terror 
            and rationales for murder is choosing the wrong one. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>When Imam Abdul 
            Omar Rahman issues a <I>fatwa</I> saying that it is the duty of 
            every Muslim to re-conquer every meter of Islamic land lost to the 
            infidel, he is unfortunately well within the tradition of Islam 
            where Muhammad’s last words on jihad were that struggle against the 
            infidel was permanent and truce was temporary for tactical reasons. 
            That a "truce’’ can last for a long time does not reassure me. What 
            does it say about negotiations for a Palestinian state? If all of 
            the Holy Land is an Arab trust for Islam then Muslims are, sooner or 
            later, obligated to destroy the Jewish state and, if so, why should 
            Israel make any concessions? We are not talking about rearranging 
            the borders of Hungary and Romania, or carving a new state out of a 
            neighboring one with appropriate political arrangements; we are 
            talking about a religious obligation to annihilate another nation 
            with the probability that most of its five million inhabitants would 
            be butchered in a new Holocaust – which also has a precedent in the 
            expulsion and despoliation of the Jewish tribes from the Hijaz in 
            Muhammed’s time. Are American Muslims ready to sign aboard for this? 
            What are the implications of their exhortations for "fairness’’ in 
            the Middle East. What is "even-handed’’ about vitiating Israel’s 
            strength until it is vulnerable to overwhelming Arab numbers? And 
            why in the world should Israel – after Yasser Arafat at Camp David 
            rejected its offer of 95 percent of the West Bank and Gaza and 
            control of Arab Jerusalem as well as Muslim holy sites – now permit 
            in Jerusalem a regime in thrall to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, pledged 
            to Israel’s destruction? </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Muslims in the 
            West – and, for that matter, everywhere – will have to decide 
            whether the holy obligation to reclaim Islamic land applies to 
            Andalusia (al-Andaluz) and much else of Spain, France up to Tours, 
            large chunks of Sicily and the Balkans to the gates of Vienna. And 
            they must ask themselves, is the decision not to do so (if they so 
            decide) arrived at because it is impracticable or immoral? The 
            difference is critical. Such revanchist schemes may seem like 
            madness but no less so than flying two airplanes into the World 
            Trade Center. Chillingly Muslim extremists have already openly 
            discussed a takeover of America. The fact that they are living a 
            fantasy does not gainsay that some of them, with a net of 
            supporters, are prepared to use violent means to advance their 
            millennial aims. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>There is 
            certainly enough intolerance to go around in many religions. Judaism 
            has its zealots, but they are marginalized in the West and are not 
            the driving force in Israel, much less running the country which is 
            still overwhelmingly secular and democratic. When Baruch Goldstein 
            kills 29 Arabs in a mosque he is reviled by most of the Jewish 
            community, not cheered as are the suicide bombers by the Arab 
            street. At a West Bank university, Palestinian students set up an 
            exhibition devoted to the grisly fruits of terror bombings, 
            presenting "displays" of severed limbs and spattered Jewish blood. 
            This could not have been done without the collusion of the 
            Palestinian Authority. It is in keeping with its fostering 
            suicide-bomber summer camps for children and using terror as a 
            political tool. What kind of government can allow such things, and 
            how can it possibly be considered a serious partner for peace? How 
            can it be trusted to keep any peace?</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Christianity 
            fought almost two centuries of religious wars before an exhausted 
            Europe was finally ready for tolerance. Islam has experienced 
            schism, faction and sects but not a true Reformation. Worse still, 
            it missed out on a Radical Enlightenment, withdrawing to tradition, 
            piety and obscurantism at the very moment that the West was 
            flowering with the political, commercial, social and technological 
            benefits of both the Reformation and the Enlightenment. Little 
            wonder then that Islam lost the ensuing footrace for supremacy. 
            Since then, Islam has coveted the wealth and power of the West 
            without being willing to accept the pluralism, tolerance, critical 
            mindset and democracy that has made it possible. Arab states 
            complain of being exploited by the West but refuse to accept their 
            own cultural responsibility in falling behind. Asian states also 
            endured colonial rule. But in Asia, nations from India to South 
            Korea to Taiwan have all managed to achieve democracy and a degree 
            of prosperity while Arab states still wallow in corruption, poverty 
            and tyranny. Blaming their failures on the West, or on the existence 
            of Israel, is a lame excuse that has gotten ever-fewer buyers and, 
            in any case, won’t solve the problems of the people who live in 
            these countries. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>All 
            monotheistic religions to some degree believe in the uniqueness of 
            their own revelation, without which the foundation of faith that 
            supports their belief would crumble. But in the modern world, most 
            of the great religions have preached tolerance and the possibility 
            that God may manifest His design to different faiths in different 
            ways. The exception is Islam. Listen to the exhortations of Muslim 
            preachers and their lay followers – who are forthright in asserting 
            their beliefs – and we hear repeatedly the mantra that Islam is 
            God’s final revelation, His last word to mankind. We are all 
            inherently Muslims even if we don’t know it and it is for our own 
            salvation that this discovery of our innate Muslimhood should be 
            brought out. Infidels must be humbled. Friendship with them is 
            forbidden. Like Communism, Islam offers its adherents an entire 
            social fabric, a complete meaning for the world, man’s place in it 
            and human destiny. It is comforting and inclusive to its adherents. 
            But to those outside its circle, it appears unforgiving, 
            contemptuous at best, intolerant at worst. For a Westerner to 
            convert to Islam is a matter of private choice. For a Muslim to 
            convert to another faith is a capital crime in nations ruled by 
            strict Sharia. Think only of the aid workers in Afghanistan who were 
            imprisoned and faced death before being rescued from the Taliban. 
            And the local Afghans who may have been receptive to Christian 
            teaching would have also faced a grim fate. No one would think twice 
            about establishing a mosque in Rome, but imagine what would happen 
            if someone attempted to build a church in Saudi Arabia. The idea of 
            land being holy, starting with the Hijaz, moving to Jerusalem and 
            then extending out to any territory that was once Muslim land, 
            explains the impetus driving the attempts to re-conquer places like 
            Kashmir and Chechnya, not as national quests but as sacred duties. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>What is hard 
            for us in the West to grasp is that after three centuries of 
            imperial, national colonial, class, ethnic and cold wars – all 
            fought for material goals after the worldwide triumph of secularism 
            – we are now in a religious war, a throwback that the world has not 
            seen on a global basis since the 17<SUP>th</SUP> century. It is a 
            religious war that is intertwined with politics and masked by the 
            appurtenances of modernity but at its heart, it is driven by an 
            atavistic belief in a struggle to conquer an infidel culture that 
            has humiliated Islam – the one true faith – for too long. And if you 
            are armed with the only truth, then it is indeed your obligation to 
            bring it to everyone else, by words if possible, by the sword if 
            necessary. Anyone who opposes you, must be doing the devil’s work 
            and is therefore fair game for destruction. It is no accident that 
            America is called "The Great Satan," because that is exactly the way 
            the mullahs perceive us. We are not an imperial overlord, or an 
            economic oppressor; we are a demonic force for evil, that must be 
            opposed with any means at hand. This sense of America as the wicked 
            "other" is driven by religious conviction, which is what inspires 
            the dedication of the Islamists and doubtless flutters the hearts of 
            other Muslims who may be too timid to take up arms but feel a glow 
            in contributing to their purchase. I find it hard to believe the 
            disclaimers of many of the imams that President Bush trotted up to 
            the national dais, who represented groups that themselves were 
            supporting and apologizing for terrorist groups until Sept. 11. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Because America 
            separates church and state, we assume conversely that all faiths do 
            the same. But in Islam, the political and the religious are one, 
            tied together in a single smooth tapestry. One explains the other, 
            one justifies the other. Muhammed was not only a religious leader 
            but a political one. He sought and held power. In America, people 
            are free to believe, or not, as they choose. We encourage religious 
            diversity and respect political dissent. To the extent that a 
            religious institution exists as a place for an individual to make a 
            private profession of faith, it is protected by the Bill of Rights. 
            But when a mosque through its imam becomes an adjunct to a terror 
            plot, as was the case with the first bombing of the World Trade 
            Center, it is no longer a sanctuary. When it is the source of 
            exhortations to commit mayhem, it forfeits the rights to be treated 
            like one. Not that clerics of all faith don’t discuss public issues 
            from the pulpit, but in Islam it is intrinsic and, given the rise of 
            Islamicist proselytizing, an ideology that is inimical not only to 
            the security of the West, but to its very idea. I am not sure that 
            it is possible for Islam to extract the political from the 
            spiritual, but until there is some separation of church and state, 
            public and private, zealotry and tolerance, I fear that the mosque 
            will be seen by most Americans like myself as a source of subversion 
            and separation, a barrier that prevents the full integration of 
            Muslims into Western society. It will be up to them to find a way to 
            embrace both the duties of the heart and that of the citizen. Until 
            they do, my Islamic problem and, more importantly, their Islamic 
            problem, won't go away.</FONT></P>
