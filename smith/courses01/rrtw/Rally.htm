      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="verdana, arial, hevetica, sans-serif" size=2><!-- #BeginEditable "body" -->TERRORISM: FREQUENTLY ASKED 
        QUESTIONS: 
        <P><!-- question --><B>What are the causes and origins of terrorism?</B> 

        <P>The Al Qaeda terror network is at war with us. These terrorists, 
        quite clearly, hate us and seek to do us harm. Osama bin Laden has 
        called it a holy duty binding on every Moslem to kill every American 
        within reach. In other words, he believes genocide against us is 
        justified. Such hate is difficult for Americans to fathom, for we know 
        ourselves to be a peaceable people. What, then, is the cause of such 
        hatred? What are the grievances of the followers of Osama bin Laden 
        which prompt them to commit mass murder of American civilians? Are they 
        such that they <I>could</I> be appeased? 
        <P>At a macro-historical level, the terrorists of Al Qaeda see 
        themselves as holy warriors in the long history of conflict between 
        Islam and the unbelievers—in particular, the unbelievers of the West, or 
        Christendom. While we are now taught that the medieval Crusades were in 
        their very nature a crime of intolerance (and it is surely true that the 
        Crusaders committed innumerable shameful atrocities), we would do well 
        also to recall that the Crusades were a belated act of strategic 
        <I>defense</I>. For Mohammed was an "armed prophet," as Machiavelli put 
        it. In the seventh and eighth centuries, Arab armies swept across the 
        Christian lands of North Africa, converting peoples at the point of the 
        sword. Crossing over into Europe at the Straits of Gibraltar, they 
        conquered nearly the whole of Spain, and their advance into Western 
        Europe was stopped only at the Battle of Tours (in central France) in 
        732. Spanish Christians fought for centuries to reclaim their country 
        and to defend against successive Muslim invasions, succeeding finally 
        only in the fifteenth century, after hundreds of years. This Spanish 
        victory, the final liberation of Christian Spain from what were, in 
        effect, Muslim imperialists or colonialists, is referred to by Osama bin 
        Laden in his videotaped response to the September 11 bombings as the 
        "tragedy of Andalusia." 
        <P>Likewise in Eastern Europe, after the fall of Constantinople to the 
        Turks in 1453, the nations of Christendom were threatened in the Balkans 
        by successive Muslim invasions. In 1683, the Turks penetrated as far as 
        the gates of Vienna, where they were defeated by the heavy cavalry of 
        the Polish king, Jan Sobieski. Centuries of war and popular uprisings in 
        the Balkans eventually liberated Christian peoples from the "Turkish 
        yoke." By the end of the nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was the 
        "sick man of Europe," while Europe reached its imperialist zenith. 
        <P>These are hardly "current events," but it is necessary to revisit 
        such history in order to understand the background to the grievances 
        which animate Al Qaeda. Their deepest grievance is the worldly success 
        of the West, or Christendom, and the relative decline in the power and 
        prestige, the splendor and dynamism of Islamic civilization over the 
        past four centuries. By the end of the First World War, nearly the whole 
        of the Muslim world had fallen under one form or another of colonial 
        administration by Western powers. Since the mid-twentieth century, the 
        Islamic lands have recovered their sovereignty, but there has been 
        little evidence of an Islamic civilizational renaissance. Instead, 
        Islamic (and especially, Arab) societies remain backward, their 
        economies stagnant even when artificially inflated with a glut of oil 
        wealth, their political systems corrupt. The seedbed of terror is a 
        profound frustration with this state of affairs. While only a very few 
        respond to this frustration with terrorism, the underlying frustration 
        is widely shared in the Muslim world. 
        <P>Some academic commentators shift the burden of argument, as it were. 
        They alter the question about the origin and cause of terrorism to ask: 
        What have <I>we Americans</I> done to bring this hatred upon ourselves? 
        They say that we can never eliminate the terrorist threat until we 
        eliminate the "root causes" of terrorism, and it is suggested that 
        America is complicit in these "root causes." In this way, the terrorists 
        are relieved of their <I>responsibility</I> for their actions while we 
        are "held responsible" for an imputed complicity in the conditions which 
        generate terrorism. In the early 1990s, similar academic experts said 
        similar things about urban crime in America. They said then that crime 
        rates could not be reduced until "root causes" —such as poverty and 
        racial injustice—were addressed. Mayor Giuliani in New York did not 
        listen to such advice. Perceived grievances are endless, and whatever 
        grievances one might have cannot justify the resort to crime, he 
        reasoned. Civilized life required a forceful effort to restore public 
        order. Consequently, the mayor reformed policing practices and 
        aggressively confronted even low-level crimes; in a few short years he 
        succeeded in drastically reducing crime in that city. New York was once 
        again a livable place. So, too, with the current terrorist attacks on 
        the United States. Whatever may be the grievances of the terrorists, 
        they cannot justify this horrible crime. 
        <P>Those who speak of the need to address the "root causes" of terrorism 
        do not propose, of course, to hand Spain over to a Muslim emirate. 
        Rather, trained in various forms of Marxist analysis, such academics 
        tend to see religion as a "superstructure," with economic relations as 
        the underlying causal factor. Thus, they insist we must do something to 
        ameliorate unjust systems of economic distribution in Arab lands. 
        <P>There is a major problem with such analysis. Osama bin Laden is 
        himself a multi-millionaire, and his closest lieutenants are educated 
        members of the professional classes. Those who fill the rosters of the 
        Al Qaeda terrorist network appear to be drawn not from the "wretched of 
        the earth" in Muslim lands, but rather from the privileged sons of the 
        middle class. In many cases, they have benefited from international 
        travel and Western education. Often, their family backgrounds are 
        relatively secular, even modern. A wholesale redistribution of wealth to 
        the poor of Arab lands would not appreciably affect the life prospects 
        of those who are now drawn into a life of terror. Therefore, it is 
        simply mistaken to view economics as the root cause which has mobilized 
        these terrorists against us. 
        <P>It is, however, fair to say that the <I>political</I> structures of 
        the Arab world leave much to be desired when judged by our Western 
        standards. Middle Eastern regimes are divided in the main between party 
        dictatorships such as the Baathist regimes of Iraq and Syria; theocratic 
        oligarchies such as the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of 
        Iran, and Sudan; military regimes such as Egypt and Pakistan; and 
        hereditary monarchies such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. While 
        the monarchical regimes have made modest experiments in democracy by 
        instituting "consultative councils" rather than parliaments, there is a 
        general—and justified—anxiety among Arab elites about democracy getting 
        "out of hand." 
        <P>Perhaps a good analogy is Germany in the 1930s. In that case, hopes 
        for stable political, economic, and social development were threatened 
        by the rise of revolutionary parties of the left and right, parties 
        which found popular appeal under conditions of economic dislocation, the 
        delegitimization of traditional authorities, and historical grievance. 
        Ultimately, the Nazi Party seized control of German society after 
        winning an electoral plurality. Totalitarianism, world war, and genocide 
        ensued. The popular American television program <I>The West Wing</I> 
        advanced an analogy that Islamic extremists are to Islam as the Ku Klux 
        Klan is to Christianity. A far better analogy would be that Al Qaeda is 
        to Arab society what the Nazis were to German society. Thus, progressive 
        American academics who argue for more democracy in the Middle East must 
        pause to consider exactly what sort of policies might be instituted by 
        "democratic" regimes in the Arab world. The Taliban in Afghanistan, like 
        the Nazis, also rode to power on popular support—and they at once 
        proceeded to oppress minorities at home and harbor ruthless terrorists 
        intent on murdering Americans abroad. Can America, can humanity, have 
        any interest in seeing such a "democratic" outcome? 
        <P>But moreover, there is a deep hypocrisy evident when left-leaning 
        academics insist that the crime of September 11 is some kind of just 
        recompense for American support for non-democratic regimes in the Middle 
        East. Such progressives routinely denounce American imperialism—but here 
        they evidently propose a kind of wholesale imperialism which would be 
        breathtaking in its scope. They appear to believe that we have the 
        responsibility, and the power, to utterly remake societies half a world 
        away, societies about which we obviously know very little. But America 
        has never succeeded in "nation-building." We were twice successful at 
        what might be called "state-rebuilding"—in the cases of post-war Germany 
        and Japan, but in both cases, unconditional surrender following American 
        victory in total war was the enabling condition for our success. No such 
        conditions now exist or are likely to exist in our dealings with Muslim 
        states, including even Afghanistan. All political action confronts the 
        fact of human free will, and America is not omnipotent; our political 
        leaders know that, but some commentators appear unacquainted with this 
        elementary reality. 
        <P>Prudence is the first law of international relations, and prudence 
        now dictates that we eliminate the immediate threat to American lives 
        hiding in Afghanistan and in covert cells around the world. It may later 
        prove necessary to widen our war to "end" other regimes that similarly 
        support the terrorist war against us. We are fortunate to have in the 
        White House today a leadership which understands these realities and 
        which has the courage to act in response to them.
