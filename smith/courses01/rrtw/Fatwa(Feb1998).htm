<P>"Bin-Ladin, al-Zawahiri, Rifa'i Taha Issue Fatwa To 'Kill Americans 
Everywhere' in Retaliation for Threats To Strike Iraq; Saddam-Annan Meeting 
Produces Agreement, Washington Voices Reservations Pending Details"</P>
<P>London, Amman, Washington, Al-Quds al- 'Arabi -- [passage omitted on reports 
of agreement reached during Annan-Saddam meeting] At another level, a number of 
fundamentalist groups leaders have issued a statement in which they issued a 
fatwa to "kill the Americans, civilians and military," in retaliation for any 
U.S. attack on Iraq.</P>
<P>The text of the fatwa -- contained in a statement faxed to Al- Quds al-'Arabi 
and signed by <EM>Shaykh Usamah Bin-Muhammad Bin-Ladin</EM> (the prominent Saudi 
oppositionist); Ayman al-Zawahiri, amir of the Jihad Group in Egypt; Abu-Yasir 
Rifa'i Ahmad Taha, a leader of the [Egyptian] Islamic Group; Shaykh Mir Hamzah, 
secretary of the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Pakistan; and Fazlul Rahman, amir of the 
Jihad Movement in Bangladesh -- says that the ruling to kill the Americans and 
their allies, civilians and military, is an individual duty [fard 'ayn] on every 
Muslim who can do so in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order 
to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and 
in order that their armies move out of all the land of Islam defeated and unable 
to threaten any Muslim in compliance with the words of Almighty God "Fight the 
pagans all together as they fight you all together."</P>
<P>Justifying the call to kill U.S. civilians and military men, the statement 
said that "U.S. aggression is affecting Muslim civilians, not just the 
military."</P>

<P>Praise be to God, who revealed the Book, controls the clouds, defeats 
factionalism, and says in His Book"But when the forbidden months are past, then 
fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, seize them, beleaguer them, and 
lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)"; and peace be upon our 
Prophet, Muhammad Bin-'Abdallah, who said I have been sent with the sword 
between my hands to ensure that no one but God is worshipped, God who put my 
livelihood under the shadow of my spear and who inflicts humiliation and scorn 
on those who disobey my orders. The Arabian Peninsula has never -- since God 
made it flat, created its desert, and encircled it with seas -- been stormed by 
any forces like the crusader armies spreading in it like locusts, eating its 
riches and wiping out its plantations. All this is happening at a time in which 
nations are attacking Muslims like people fighting over a plate of food. In the 
light of the grave situation and the lack of support, we and you are obliged to 
discuss current events, and we should all agree on how to settle the matter.</P>
<P>No one argues today about three facts that are known to everyone; we will 
list them, in order to remind everyone</P>
<P>First, for over seven years the United States has been occupying the lands of 
Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches, 
dictating to its rulers, humiliating its people, terrorizing its neighbors, and 
turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the 
neighboring Muslim peoples.</P>
<P>If some people have in the past argued about the fact of the occupation, all 
the people of the Peninsula have now acknowledged it.</P>
<P>The best proof of this is the Americans' continuing aggression against the 
Iraqi people using the Peninsula as a staging post, even though all its rulers 
are against their territories being used to that end, but they are helpless. 
Second, despite the great devastation inflicted on the Iraqi people by the 
crusader-Zionist alliance, and despite the huge number of those killed, which 
has exceeded 1 million... despite all this, the Americans are once against 
trying to repeat the horrific massacres, as though they are not content with the 
protracted blockade imposed after the ferocious war or the fragmentation and 
devastation.</P>
<P>So here they come to annihilate what is left of this people and to humiliate 
their Muslim neighbors.</P>
<P>Third, if the Americans' aims behind these wars are religious and economic, 
the aim is also to serve the Jews' petty state and divert attention from its 
occupation of Jerusalem and murder of Muslims there.</P>
<P>The best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the strongest 
neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the 
region such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan into paper statelets and 
through their disunion and weakness to guarantee Israel's survival and the 
continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the Peninsula.</P>
<P>All these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a clear declaration 
of war on God, his messenger, and Muslims. And ulema have throughout Islamic 
history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy 
destroys the Muslim countries. This was revealed by Imam Bin-Qadamah in "Al- 
Mughni," Imam al-Kisa'i in "Al- Bada'i," al-Qurtubi in his interpretation, and 
the shaykh of al-Islam [not further identified] in his books, where he said "As 
for the fighting to repulse [an enemy], it is aimed at defending sanctity and 
religion, and it is a duty as agreed [by the ulema]. Nothing is more sacred than 
belief except repulsing an enemy who is attacking religion and life."</P>
<P><EM><STRONG>On that basis, and in compliance with God's order, we issue the 
following fatwa to all Muslims</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies -- civilians and military 
-- is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which 
it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy 
mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all 
the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in 
accordance with the words of Almighty God, "and fight the pagans all together as 
they fight you all together," and "fight them until there is no more tumult or 
oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God."</P>
<P>This is in addition to the words of Almighty God "And why should ye not fight 
in the cause of God and of those who, being weak, are ill- treated (and 
oppressed) -- women and children, whose cry is 'Our Lord, rescue us from this 
town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from thee one who will 
help!'"</P>
<P>We -- with God's help -- call on every Muslim who believes in God and wishes 
to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans and plunder 
their money wherever and whenever they find it. We also call on Muslim ulema, 
leaders, youths, and soldiers to launch the raid on Satan's U.S. troops and the 
devil's supporters allying with them, and to displace those who are behind them 
so that they may learn a lesson.</P>
<P>Almighty God said "O ye who believe, give your response to God and His 
Apostle, when He calleth you to that which will give you life. And know that God 
cometh between a man and his heart, and that it is He to whom ye shall all be 
gathered."</P>
<P>Almighty God also says "O ye who believe, what is the matter with you, that 
when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of God, ye cling so heavily to the 
earth! Do ye prefer the life of this world to the hereafter? But little is the 
comfort of this life, as compared with the hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He 
will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him 
ye would not harm in the least. For God hath power over all things."</P>
<P>Almighty God also says "So lose no heart, nor fall into despair. For ye must 
gain mastery if ye are true in faith."</FONT></P><FONT size=1>

<P><FONT size=3><EM><STRONG>Editor's Note on the word "fatwa": it means 
judgement</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>Mr. Bin Laden has been involved in the declaration several "fatwas." He 
allegedly uses this these fatwas to justify his "holy war" or "Jihad" against 
America and her allies.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>According to the Islamic science called "Usul al-fiqh" (Principles of 
Jurisprudence), a fatwa is binding when these four conditions are satisfied:</P>
<P>1) It is in line with relevant legal proofs, deducted from Koranic verses and 
hadiths; 2) It is issued by a person (or a board) having due knowledge and 
sincerity of heart; 3) It is free from individual opportunism, and not depending 
on political servitude; 4) It is adequate with the needs of the contemporary 
world.</FONT></P><FONT size=1>

<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>OSAMA BIN LADEN THREATENS THE U.S. ON AMERICAN 
TELEVISION</FONT><FONT size=3> <BR>By Steve Macko, ERRI Risk Analyst</P>
<P>WASHINGTON (EmergencyNet News) - A terrorist financier wanted by Saudi 
Arabian and U.S. authorities for at least two bombings appeared on U.S. network 
television on Wednesday and challenged the U.S. military to try to capture him. 
Appearing on ABC News' "World News Tonight" and later on "Nightline," Osama bin 
Laden spoke from what it said was a heavily-armed camp somewhere inside 
Afghanistan, which has given refuge to the stateless Saudi Arabian and a group 
of his followers.</P>
<P>The slight and bearded bin Laden appeared in a poorly-lit tent and said he 
was ready if U.S. forces attempted to track him down and arrest him.</P>
<P>The terrorist challenged, "Whether they try or not, we have seen in the last 
decade the decline of the American government and the weakness of the American 
soldier."</P>
<P>Bin Laden has vowed to wage a jihad or holy war against U.S. forces in Saudi 
Arabia because of U.S. support for Israel. He broadened his threat to include 
all Americans, military and civilian, in the Middle East.</P>
<P>He said, "We do not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms 
and civilians. They are all targets in this fatwa (a religious decree) ... we 
must use such punishment to keep your evil away from Moslems, Moslem women and 
children."</P>
<P>The U.S. State Department has identified bin Laden as a major world sponsor 
of Islamic extremism. He is believed to have been a major financier of the two 
terrorist bombings in Saudi Arabia.</P>
<P>The terrorist said, "We predict a black day for America."</P>
<P>U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy Berger told ABC News in their report, 
"Osama bin Laden may be the most dangerous non-state terrorist in the 
world."</FONT></P>

<P>U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT NEWS</P>
<P>N.AFRICA-MIDDLE EAST-S.ASIA</P>
<P>WASHINGTON (EmergencyNet News) - On 12 June, the U.S. Department of State 
issued the following Public Announcement in regards to the Middle East and South 
Asia:</P>
<P>"In a recent interview with an American news organization, terrorist 
financier Osama Bin Laden reiterated his threats against the U.S. In an apparent 
reference to Americans, he said that he did not distinguish between military and 
civilians -- both groups are targets. In a May 26 press conference, Bin Laden 
implied that some type of terrorist action could be mounted within the next 
several weeks. The U.S. continues to receive information from other sources 
which indicates planning for an attack against Americans in the Persian Gulf 
(also referred to as the Arabian Gulf). We take these threats seriously and the 
U.S. is increasing security at many U.S. Government facilities in the Middle 
East and South Asia.</P>
<P>Therefore, the Department of State believes it useful to remind Americans in 
the region to maintain a high level of vigilance and alertness and to take 
appropriate steps to increase their security awareness and lessen their 
vulnerability. Americans should try to maintain a low profile, reduce travel in 
the region where possible, vary routes and times for all required travel, and 
treat mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.</P>
<P>This Public Announcement replaces the June 2 Public Announcement on the 
Middle East and South Asia and expires August 31, 1998."</FONT></P>
