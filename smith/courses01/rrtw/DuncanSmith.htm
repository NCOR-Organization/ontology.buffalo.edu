            <P><!--zonk pullout summary><b>Iain Duncan Smith </b>and <b>David Trimble </b>urge the Government not to exclude domestic terrorists, such as Irish republicans, from its proposed legislation<!--zonk endpullout -->IMAGINE, 
            for a moment, two scenes. The first is a busy Saturday afternoon in 
            a market town in the United Kingdom, packed with shoppers. Shortly 
            after 3pm, with no apparent warning, a bomb explodes, leaving 29 
            people murdered and hundreds more injured. The second takes place in 
            America, when two hijacked planes, again with no warning, fly into 
            the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, killing thousands and 
            injuring many more.
            <P>The comparison does not end there. In both cases, the killed and 
            injured were going about their ordinary daily business. Among the 
            dead were nationals from more than one country.
            <P>Of course, one difference between these two atrocities - one that 
            took place in Omagh on August 15, 1998 and the other in New York on 
            September 11 - is scale. Of course, many more people were killed in 
            the World Trade Centre, and at the Pentagon, than at Omagh. The 
            other difference is that one took place in our own country, the 
            other abroad. Yet there the differences end. We should not forget, 
            however, that some 3,600 people have been killed as a result of 
            terrorism associated with Northern Ireland.
            <P>These two acts illustrate a point that we have both made 
            repeatedly since September 11. There is not, and never can be, any 
            moral distinction made between terrorists or terrorism. What 
            happened in America is the same as that which has been carried out 
            in the United Kingdom, and in particular in Northern Ireland.
            <P>Osama bin Laden and his followers are no different from those who 
            planned and carried out Omagh, Warrenpoint, Hyde Park, Enniskillen 
            or countless other atrocities during some 30 years of terrorism in 
            Ulster. It follows that there should be no question of recognising, 
            or creating in law, different categories of terrorist organisation.
            <P>Yet this is precisely what this Government has done. It did so 
            first within the United Kingdom when, immediately after Omagh, 
            Parliament was recalled to pass emergency anti-terrorist 
            legislation. Measures were introduced that apply to illegal 
            terrorist groups that are not, in the Government's view, 
            "maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire", but not to those 
            illegal groups that are. The Government repeated this distinction in 
            the Terrorism Act last year. It has established the concept of 
            "good" and "bad" terrorists. We utterly reject this.
            <P>Now, in the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Bill, currently 
            before Parliament, the Government has taken this further. The Bill 
            creates a distinction between international and domestic terrorists 
            and groups, and introduces different penalties for them. 
            Specifically, the Bill states that: "International terrorism does 
            not include terrorism concerned only with the affairs of a part of 
            the United Kingdom." There could hardly be a more obvious device to 
            exclude terrorist groups in Northern Ireland. What would be the 
            response if an Arab or Basque terrorist working on behalf of an 
            Irish republican group were involved in bombing an English city?
            <P>This cannot be justified. The links between international 
            terrorists and Irish republicans are well established. In August, 
            three senior republicans were apprehended in Colombia, suspected of 
            collaborating with the narco-terrorist group Farc. Much of the IRA's 
            arsenal results from its connections with the Arab world, 
            specifically Libya. Prominent members of the Basque separatist 
            movement, Eta, have been regular visitors to republican conferences 
            over the years.
            <P>In many respects, the IRA has been the prototype for global 
            terrorists and the organisation from which they have drawn 
            encouragement. It was the IRA that perfected the murder of innocent 
            civilians for political gain, in "spectaculars" such as Bloody 
            Friday, La Mon and Enniskillen. It was an IRA commander, Brendan 
            "Bic" McFarlane - famous for machine-gunning civilians trying to 
            escape the bar he had bombed - who wanted to bring down Concorde 
            with a Sam-7.
            <P>Like other terrorist organisations the world over, republicans 
            and so-called loyalists in Northern Ireland thrive on organised 
            crime. The bulk of their finances comes from the millions they make 
            through racketeering, smuggling petrol and cigarettes, and by 
            sanctioning the sale of drugs, from which they cream off huge 
            profits.
            <P>There is no difference between the illicit trade in drugs that 
            helps to finance al-Qa'eda and that which sustains the activities of 
            paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. The Government has rightly 
            responded to the threat to our security posed by bin Laden. We 
            support the move to introduce new powers - as we would any effective 
            anti-terrorist measures. Yet these measures should apply equally to 
            all those suspected of involvement in terrorism. That should include 
            organisations in the United Kingdom.
            <P>Terrorist organisations within the United Kingdom remain both 
            active and highly capable. Even with the welcome first act of 
            decommissioning by the Provisional IRA, Ireland remains awash with 
            arms and explosives. In recent days, the arrests of individuals 
            suspected of being involved with the Real IRA have reminded us of 
            their clear intent to commit terrorist atrocities.
            <P>Senior republicans, shaken by the response to the events of 
            September 11, are trying desperately to justify the campaign waged 
            by the IRA over 30 years. Gerry Adams, speaking in New York 
            recently, claimed that "those who support us know the difference 
            between what's been happening in Ireland and what happened in this 
            city on September 11".
            <P>Most people will treat those words with justified contempt. Our 
            fear, however, is that the Government risks giving a spurious 
            legitimacy to this distinction. By creating different classes of 
            terrorist, the danger is that all terrorists will be encouraged to 
            believe that, if only they persist, sooner or later they will 
            succeed. That is why, at this late stage, we urge the Government to 
            think again and end the anomaly that it has created.
