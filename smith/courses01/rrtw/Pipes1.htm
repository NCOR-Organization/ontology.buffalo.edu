      <H1>Arabs Have Never Accepted Israel<BR><SPAN class=subtitle>Wall Street 
      Journal Europe<BR>December 3, 2001</SPAN></H1>
      <P>In June of this year, Palestinian television broadcast a sermon in a 
      Gaza mosque in which the imam, Ibrahim Madi, made the following statement: 
      "God willing, this unjust state [of] Israel, will be erased; this unjust 
      state the United States will be erased; this unjust state Britain will be 
      erased."<BR><BR>The sheik's gentle homily came to mind this weekend, when 
      Palestinian suicide bombers launched nearly simultaneous attacks on 
      Israeli civilians in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Gaza, killing 26 and wounding 
      nearly 200. If a reminder were needed that the war on terrorism goes 
      beyond Sept. 11 and the campaign in Afghanistan, the Palestinians provided 
      a powerful mnemonic. Even as U.S. and British forces respond to the World 
      Trade Center atrocity by closing in on Kandahar, the last city under 
      militant Islamic rule in Afghanistan, Israeli forces began preparing a 
      response to the Jerusalem atrocity with a "frontal attack" against the 
      Palestinian Authority.<BR><BR>The American and Israeli situations seem 
      very different to some, but Sheik Madi's remarks show they are not. In 
      both cases, the forces of militant Islam are targeting a Western country 
      with the intention of destroying it. Osama bin Laden years ago declared a 
      jihad against all Christians and Jews while his friend Mullah Omar, the 
      Taliban dictator, provided more specifics in mid-November: "The current 
      situation in Afghanistan is related to a bigger cause-that is the 
      destruction of America. If God's help is with us, this will happen within 
      a short period of time-keep in mind this prediction. The real matter is 
      the extinction of America, and God willing, it will fall to the 
      ground."<BR><BR><B>'Cancerous Tumor'</B><BR><BR>Likewise, with an almost 
      numbing routineness, militant Islamic leaders call for the destruction of 
      Israel. The most powerful of them all, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali 
      Khamenei called sometime ago for "this cancerous tumor of a state [to] be 
      removed from the region."<BR><BR>There are differences, to be sure. The 
      battle against the United States is newer, far less advanced, and less 
      supported by nonmilitant Islamic elements. Ironically, however, the U.S. 
      government has declared a "war on terrorism," while its Israeli 
      counterpart is still (with U.S. encouragement) trying to hammer out a deal 
      with its enemies. These differences aside, the drive to destroy the United 
      States and Israel are at base similar.<BR><BR>The latest attacks on Israel 
      serve to remind us of something else too:<BR><BR>that the attempt to 
      destroy the Jewish state has gone on since it came into existence in 1948. 
      For over a half century, the majority of Arabs have persisted in seeing 
      Israel as no more than a temporary irritant, one they eventually expect to 
      dispense with, at best permitting Israelis to live in "Palestine" as a 
      subject people and at worst massacring them.<BR><BR>This destructive 
      impulse has waxed and waned since 1948. When a seemingly weak Israel first 
      came into existence, it started very high. Then 45 years of steadily 
      losing to a tough and determined Israel left the Arabs reeling by 1993 and 
      partially open to the possibility of accepting it. Rather than pushing 
      this advantage to achieve full acceptance, the Israelis made the historic 
      mistake of easing up and offering their two main enemies, the Syrians and 
      Palestinians, an advantageous deal.<BR><BR>These offers completely 
      backfired: rather than understood as far-sighted strategic concessions 
      intended to close the conflict, Arabs interpreted them as signs of 
      Israel's demoralization. The result was an upsurge in violence and renewed 
      Arab hopes of destroying Israel through force of arms. For the first time 
      since the 1960s, politicians, civil servants, religious leaders, 
      journalists, and intellectuals routinely called for Israel's 
      elimination.<BR><BR>Obviously, this wall of rejection harms Israel, 
      denying its bid to live as a normal nation, subjecting its population to 
      homicidal attacks, and compelling it to take tough steps against 
      neighbors. But Israel is prospering despite these attacks, boasting of a 
      high standard of living, a democratic body politic, and a vibrant culture. 
      In fact, the real harm is felt primarily by Arabs. The destructive urge 
      prevents talented and venerable peoples from achieving their potential. 
      Arabs are focused on harming Israelis rather than improving their 
      standards of living, opening the political process to all, and insuring 
      the rule of law. The result is plain: Arabs are among the world leaders in 
      percentages of dictatorships, rogue states, violent conflicts, and 
      military spending.<BR><BR>A solution is easy to propose though much harder 
      to implement: the Arabs must reconcile themselves to Israel's existence. 
      Only that will close down the century-old conflict, permit Israel to 
      attain normality, and launch Arabs on the path to modernity.<BR><BR>This 
      interpretation of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which puts the onus on Arabs, 
      differs profoundly from the usual one. Even Israelis, not to speak of 
      Arabs and everyone else, tend to think that the Arab acceptance of Israel 
      is already done and now it is up to Israel to do its part by making a 
      series of concessions (handing over the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, 
      etc.).<BR><BR><B>Inflamed Rhetoric</B><BR><BR>If it was possible to 
      believe in the Arab acceptance of Israel in 1993, surely today's inflamed 
      rhetoric and the drumbeat of Palestinian violence proves that it was a 
      mirage. Israel has the unenviable task of convincing its enemies that 
      their dreams of its destruction will fail; translated into action, this 
      means it must show resolve and toughness. How can it be otherwise? Such 
      lethal intentions as one finds widely in the Arabic-speaking countries can 
      only be defeated with strength. This will not be pleasant; Israel will 
      incur both foreign condemnation and domestic discontent, but it has no 
      choice.<BR><BR>Understanding the conflict this new way has profound 
      implications for the West. It means that Europe and the United States, 
      always eager to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict, can most helpfully do 
      their part by offering fewer clever plans and making a greater effort to 
      comprehend its basic truths. It means coming to terms with the basic fact 
      of continued Arab rejection of Israel, with all its destructive 
      implications. It means seeing the Israeli predicament, tolerating its need 
      to be tough, and pressing the Arabs to make a drastic change in 
      course.<BR><BR>For many governments, even the American one, this approach 
      requires a reversal from current policy (which is to press Israel). Such 
      as shift will not come easily, but it is a near-prerequisite for anyone 
      truly serious about closing down the Arab-Israeli conflict.</P>
