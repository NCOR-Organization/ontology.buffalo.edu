<h3>Genocide in the Classroom</h3>
<h5>by Paul Craig Roberts</h5>
<br>
Language was a prime factor in the murder of six million Jews by the National
Socialists in Germany and sixty to eighty million "class enemies" by communists
in Russia and China. Today similar language is being used in American colleges
and universities to annihilate the history, culture, and self-esteem of white
people.<br>
<br>
Halls of learning have become re-education camps where legions of "diversity
educators" and "sensitivity trainers" strive to "get inside" the minds of
white students and replace private conscience, identity and belief with group
guilt Propaganda and emotional manipulation are used to teach whites to think
the best about "people of color" and the worst about themselves. Whites are
cold, logical, and distant ("ice people"). Blacks are warm, intuitive, empathetic,
and spontaneous. Whites are relentlessly acquisitive. Blacks are in harmony
with nature. Whites as a group use the "power structure" that they control
to victimize blacks as a group.<br>
<br>
The most prominent of the re-educators is Jane Elliott. She teaches that
"white people invented racism" and are a parasitic race who even stole the
English language from people of color. She uses a film, "Blue Eyed," to teach
white students self-contempt and bloodguilt for their racist evil.<br>
<br>
Jane Elliott thinks of herself as a kind, loving woman who is a tireless
foe of racism. Corporations, government agencies, and universities pay Elliott
$6,000 a day to teach white people to hate themselves. The media lionizes
her. Disney plans to make a movie of her life.<br>
<br>
While teaching whites to hate themselves, "diversity educators" are simultaneously
teaching "people of color" to hate whites for their racist oppression. The
"privilege" of white skin can only be remedied by legal privileges for blacks
&ndash; thus, the necessity of racial quotas and affirmative action.<br>
<br>
In the re-education camps that masquerade as universities, it is an axiom
that reverse discrimination is a myth. The discrimination that white students
experience in university admissions and sensitivity training is not considered
to be discrimination, but necessary re-education to rescue whites from impermissible
ways of being.<br>
<br>
"Diversity educators" also deny that our culture is being Balkanized. What
is really happening is that "evil racist white culture" is being stamped
out, and whites are finding a new existence as allies of the oppressed. Once
whiteness is extirpated, we will all be warm, intuitive, and love one another.<br>
<br>
If you want to read more, consult Professor Alan Charles Kors, "Thought Reform
101" at www.thefire.org.<br>
<br>
Professor Kors, a brave man, reports that white students are experiencing
the fate of Winston Smith, the fictional character in George Orwell&rsquo;s 1984
whose "false consciousness" must be purged to make him fit with the new society.<br>
<br>
Professor Kors says that the urge to "remold" whites has led re-educationists
to pursue white students into "the ultimate refuges of self-consciousness,
conscience and private beliefs" in an attempt to break down individual identity.
Professor Kors does not say so, but this is genocide.<br>
<br>
Moreover, it can lead to physical genocide. German intellectuals pursued
the Jews with words for sixty years before the rise of Hitler. Lenin and
his followers murdered "class enemies" first with words, and then with re-education
camps.<br>
<br>
It is extraordinary that white taxpayers and donors are pouring billions
of dollars into re-education camps dedicated to the destruction of "white
consciousness."<br>
<br>
As happened under the Nazis and Communists, once a race or class is assigned
collective guilt, all protections fall away. White students are everywhere
experiencing the demise of due process and their First Amendment rights.<br>
<br>
Christopher Monson is a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota,
where he is an activist on behalf of increasing minority presence on campus.<br>
<br>
Recently, he argued that a public university had obligations to public access
and that it would be illegal to prevent credit card companies from soliciting
on campus, just as "not allowing blacks on campus" would be illegal.<br>
<br>
His harmless analogy was deemed "a racial insult." Monson was sentenced to
sensitivity training by university president Suzanne Williams without a hearing
or due process.<br>
<br>
This lawlessness at St. Cloud State is reminiscent of Nazi and Communist
lawlessness. Once Jews were stigmatized, their rights as German citizens
evaporated. The same happened to "class enemies."<br>
<br>
The stigmatization of whites has reached the point where President Williams
did not blink an eye at exercising unconstitutional power over the free speech
of Monson.<br>
<br>
Students know the situation is out of hand. A recent Zogby poll found that
95.7 percent believe high academic standards and diversity of ideas are more
important than ethnic diversity; 92.7 percent oppose racial quotas; 57.9
percent say there is too much politics in the classroom, and 55.4 percent
say "political correctness" restricts what they can learn and say.<br>
<br>
Parents, donors and trustees need to find some courage before the Nazification
of the universities is a fait accompli.<br>
