        <P>JACK MILES, Senior Advisor to the President at the J.&nbsp;Paul Getty 
        Trust and a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy, is 
        the author of <EM>Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God</EM> 
        (Alfred&nbsp;A. Knopf).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>In the 1940s, the most important foreign policy intellectual in the 
      United States was George&nbsp;F. Kennan. Kennan, who served briefly in the 
      Truman Administration, was among the first to recognize that the United 
      States could not defeat communism outright but could contain it and the 
      nations infected by it, beginning with the Soviet Union. What came to be 
      called the Cold War seems in retrospect to have been inevitable, but it 
      was not inevitable at all. Instead of the Cold War, the world could all 
      too easily have fought World War&nbsp;III. Containment was the bold and 
      politically creative alternative to that war. The 1947 article in 
      <EM>Foreign Affairs</EM> in which Kennan, writing as "X," first laid out 
      containment as a strategy remains, unsurprisingly, the most popular 
      article ever published in that periodical.</P>
      <P>In the 1990s, the most important foreign policy intellectual in the 
      United States may yet prove to have been Samuel&nbsp;P. Huntington. The 
      second-most-popular article in the history of <EM>Foreign Affairs</EM> has 
      been his controversial 1993 "The Clash of Civilizations," an attempt to 
      see what lay beyond the end of Kennan's Cold War. What Huntington saw was, 
      on the one hand, economic and cultural globalization and, on the other, 
      resistance to it by those who saw it as merely the latest form of Western, 
      historically Christian, and at this late date specifically American 
      imperialism. Though Huntington noted that many non-Western powers had cast 
      their lot with the emerging global order, it seemed equally clear to him 
      that China and world Islam had not done so, might never do so, and might 
      even join forces in a joint counteroffensive against the&nbsp;West.</P>
      <P>"The Clash of Civilizations" was ferociously criticized when it 
      appeared, and events have not entirely confirmed it. Thus, though 
      relations between China and the West remain strained, many informed 
      observers now predict that the aging leadership of the People's Republic 
      will soon be succeeded by a generation open to the West politically as 
      well as economically. The Beijing Olympics may yet become the symbol of 
      this rapprochement. A week after the World Trade Center was destroyed, 
      China was admitted to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>But what of world Islam? The border separating what Muslims call 
      <EM>dar al-islam,</EM> the "House of Submission (Islam)," from <EM>dar 
      al-harb,</EM> the "House of Warfare" seems increasingly to define a long 
      irregular battlefront, one that as of September&nbsp;11, 2001, stretches 
      across four continents. With striking frequency, those post-Cold War 
      conflicts typically termed "local" or "parochial" or at most "sectarian" 
      turn out to be battles between historically Muslim and historically 
      non-Muslim populations. An incomplete list would include, moving from east 
      to&nbsp;west:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Roman Catholics vs. Muslims on Mindanao in the Philippines 
        <LI>Roman Catholics vs. Muslims on Timor in Indonesia 
        <LI>Confucians and Buddhists vs. Muslims in Singapore and Malaysia 
        <LI>Hindus vs. Muslims in Kashmir and, intermittently, within India 
        itself 
        <LI>Russian Orthodox Catholics vs. Muslims in Afghanistan 
        <LI>Russian Orthodox Catholics vs. Muslims in Chechnya 
        <LI>Armenian Catholics vs. Muslims in Nagorno-Karabakh 
        <LI>Maronite and Melchite Catholics vs. Muslims in Lebanon 
        <LI>Jews vs. Muslims in Israel/Palestine 
        <LI>Animists and Christians of several denominations vs. Muslims in 
        Sudan 
        <LI>Ethiopian Orthodox Catholics vs. Muslims in Eritrea 
        <LI>Anglicans and Roman Catholics vs. Muslims in&nbsp;Uganda 
        <LI>Greek Orthodox Catholics vs. Muslims in&nbsp;Cyprus 
        <LI>Serbian Orthodox Catholics vs. Muslims in Bosnia and&nbsp;Kosovo 
        <LI>Roman Catholics vs. Muslims in Algeria 
        <LI>Anglicans and Roman Catholics vs. Muslims in Nigeria. </LI></UL>
      <P>Left off this list are conflicts that, however bitter, have not risen 
      to the level of outright civil war. On a list of this sort we might find, 
      among others: Assyrian Orthodox Catholics vs. Muslims in Iraq and Coptic 
      Catholics vs. Muslims in&nbsp;Egypt.</P>
      <P>My point in drawing up this list is to suggest that for the 
      <EM>umma</EM> -- an ancient Arabic term that has come to denote the 
      totality of Muslims in the world at any given time -- the House of Islam 
      must surely seem a civilization under siege. I use the word 
      <EM>civilization,</EM> as Huntington did, because <EM>umma</EM> refers to 
      so much more than our word <EM>religion</EM> comprehends. In the 
      formulation of one contemporary scholar, it refers to "religion, shared 
      values, and common concerns" yet "does not denote nationality, kinship, or 
      ethnicity." The <EM>umma</EM> is Islam's version of what secular diplomacy 
      likes to call the international community, and there is no third 
      contender. India and China are each enormous, and each has a large 
      diaspora, yet of neither can it be said that "it does not denote 
      nationality, kinship, or ethnicity." Only the <EM>umma</EM> matches the 
      international community in internal variety, geographical dispersion, and 
      potentially global ambition.</P>
      <P>The clash-of-civilizations question, from the Muslim side, is whether 
      the <EM>umma</EM> can join the international community or whether it must 
      incorporate the international community into itself. From the Western 
      side, the clash-of-civilizations question, though essentially the same 
      question inverted, must begin with the perhaps grudging recognition that 
      there exist, in the first place, two bona fide international communities 
      separated by a genuine cultural border along which for a long while now 
      there has been more war than peace. No single statement in Huntington's 
      <EM>Foreign Affairs</EM> article attracted more critical comment than 
      "Islam has bloody borders." In the subsequent book, Huntington wrote: "I 
      made that judgment on the basis of a casual survey of intercivilizational 
      conflicts. Quantitative evidence from every disinterested source 
      conclusively demonstrates its validity." The book assembles that evidence, 
      and further evidence has accumulated&nbsp;since.</P>
      <P>It is easy in the historically Christian cultures of Europe and America 
      to dismiss conflicts between Hindus and Muslims or even between Jews and 
      Muslims as alien fanaticism. It is almost equally easy to regard the 
      struggles of exotic Christianities like Ethiopian Orthodoxy as irrelevant 
      to any such struggle that the once Christian but now secular West might 
      have with&nbsp;Islam.</P>
      <P>But to do this is to make a serious mistake if only because from the 
      Muslim side where modernity, Christianity, and the West are a single 
      unholy stew, all these struggles are understood to be the same struggle. 
      For the West, the defining struggles of the twentieth century have been, 
      in succession, democracy vs. fascism and democracy vs. communism. But for 
      the <EM>umma,</EM> these are simply the latest civil wars in the long, 
      bloody history of the House of Warfare. In the last days of World 
      War&nbsp;II, what mattered in a Muslim country like Morocco was not that 
      racist fascism had been defeated but that the yoke of Christian France 
      might at last be thrown off. In the last days of the Cold War, what 
      mattered in a country like Afghanistan was not that godless communism had 
      been defeated but that the knout had fallen at last from the fist of 
      Christian Russia. The <EM>umma</EM> had its own reasons for holding the 
      view -- common enough in the West, for other reasons -- that the Soviet 
      Union had simply continued the Russian Empire in a more malignant form. 
      Secularized Christianity, as seen from inside the House of Islam, is 
      simply degenerate Christianity and as such is even more alien to Islam 
      than its ancestor.</P>
      <P>Americans argue over whether Harry Truman or Ronald Reagan deserves 
      more credit for defeating the Soviet Union. Osama bin Laden, to American 
      astonishment, thought that the <EM>umma,</EM> rallying to a <EM>jihad</EM> 
      in Afghanistan, had won the real victory and would now proceed to win a 
      second victory over the United States itself. American astonishment at the 
      grandiose claim and American horror at the lethal ambition may stand as a 
      measure of the chasm that separates Western and Muslim civilization. 
      Unless this chasm can be bridged, the world may slide into a war of 
      terrorist reprisal and counterreprisal with no end in sight. Where should 
      the work&nbsp;begin?</P>
      <P>In my judgment, it should begin with theology, a term that na&iuml;ve 
      enthusiasts for globalization tend to use as a synonym for 
      that-which-may-be-dispensed-with or, worse, that-which-gets-in-the-way. 
      But real theology is more than that, and the moment may be at hand for 
      religion -- and for theology as its intellectual dimension -- to come in 
      from the cold as a topic in international diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Because of the secularization of the state in the West and the 
      concomitant privatization of religion, Western governments, when dealing 
      with one another, do not expect to be required to deal with one another's 
      religious beliefs or religious leaders. But in the House of Islam, 
      religious leaders typically have a far greater claim on the public than do 
      civilian leaders, and it is a fatal mistake to leave the Muslim public -- 
      the <EM>umma</EM> -- out of the equation. At the end of World War&nbsp;I, 
      as historian David Fromkin cogently demonstrates in <EM>A Peace to End All 
      Peace,</EM> Britain and France vastly overestimated the importance of Arab 
      nationalism and correspondingly underestimated the importance of Muslim 
      religion as an organizing principle in the polity they sought to construct 
      on the ruins of the Turkish Empire. In effect, the British and the French 
      were psychologically incapable of dealing with the Middle East other than 
      through leaders manufactured to resemble their nominally religious but 
      passionately nationalist selves. They were at a loss when confronted with 
      a culture whose real leaders were passionately religious and only 
      nominally nationalist.</P>
      <P>After 1956, when the United States became the dominant power in the 
      Middle East, it made the same mistake -- vastly overestimating Iranian 
      nationalism as represented by the Shah and correspondingly underestimating 
      Muslim religion as represented by Ayatollah Khomeini. It was as if the 
      United States had to find someone like the Shah to deal with because, 
      well, how could a self-respecting secretary of state possibly do business 
      with an ayatollah? What would they discuss? Theology?</P>
      <P>Yes, friends, theology. And secretaries of state may have to learn some 
      theology if the current clash between Western and Muslim civilization is 
      to yield to disengagement and peaceful coexistence, to say nothing of more 
      fruitful kinds of relationship. If Osama bin Laden is a spiritual leader 
      with military designs on the United States, the first, crucial insight 
      should be that he and his movement must be dealt with as what they are. To 
      suppose that we can achieve security by dealing with him as a common 
      criminal and with the Muslim governments that harbor his movement as 
      secular governments unconcerned with the religious dimension in his appeal 
      is to fight this new war as if it were the last&nbsp;war.</P>
      <P>To say this is not to dignify the man but to recognize that containing 
      the threat he poses may entail promoting a true alternative to him in the 
      world where he originates. This task, in turn, will require more theology 
      than it takes to issue a routine and utterly uninformed declaration that, 
      of course, Osama bin Laden does not represent true Islam. Who 
      <EM>does</EM> represent true Islam? "Will the real Islam please stand up?" 
      This is the kind of question that our military and diplomatic institutions 
      are designed never to ask and never to notice that they are not asking. In 
      his 1997 memoirs, Kennan characterized the world the West faces as one for 
      which "neither our ingrained habits nor our international institutions 
      have prepared us." He was right, and in no regard more so 
      this&nbsp;one.</P>
      <P>Engaging a <EM>jihad</EM> for the soul of Islam as if it were an 
      international manhunt for a common criminal is a battle plan guaranteed to 
      fail. How can we make war against all the nations that have harbored the 
      agents of Osama bin Laden when the United States itself is one of those 
      nations? We have done so unwillingly and unwittingly, but how witting or 
      willing was Egypt to harbor the Muslim Brotherhood agents who assassinated 
      President Anwar Sadat? So far, the paper trail left by the World Trade 
      Center saboteurs has led to friendly Arab states like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, 
      and the United Arab Emirates rather than to Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan. 
      Is this not just what one would expect of a movement out to conceal its 
      tracks and frustrate retaliation? Though bin Laden declared himself the 
      enemy of virtually every Muslim government <EM>except</EM> the Taliban 
      regime in Afghanistan, some Muslim regimes clearly stood higher on his 
      enemies list than others. How very clever to implicate just those regimes 
      in his crimes.</P>
      <P>But in the long run, there cannot be any definitive sorting out of good 
      Muslim states from bad ones. It is the Muslim <EM>umma</EM> as a whole 
      that has harbored this murderous movement within it, and it is the Muslim 
      <EM>umma</EM> as a whole that must somehow be persuaded to break with it. 
      Here we begin to see the novel defensive strategy that might become in 
      this new global confrontation what Kennan's containment was in the last 
      one. Just as militant communism could not be militarily defeated in the 
      last clash of civilizations, so militant Islam cannot be militarily 
      defeated in the new one. Decapitation does not deal a death blow when the 
      enemy has many heads. Peace will come not when any one terrorist and his 
      network of secret agents have been "surgically" excised but when an 
      authentic alternative vision has emerged within the House of Islam that 
      makes the vision of victory-by-terrorism irrelevant and unwelcome.</P>
      <P>The development of such an alternative vision, however, will require a 
      major paradigm shift in Western diplomacy. It will no longer suffice to 
      treat religion as a mere happenstance ("I happen to be Jewish," "I happen 
      to be Muslim") and therefore as a political irrelevancy. This method of 
      dealing with religion politically may have served us well enough in 
      overcoming Christianity's own hideous wars of religion. But the old way 
      will not meet this new challenge, for it takes off the table just the 
      topic that militant Islam finds most compelling. One can no more discuss 
      that topic without discussing theology than one can discuss communism 
      without discussing ideology. Theology is the ideological element in 
      religion, and nothing at this moment could be more tragically evident than 
      that we have ignored it to our&nbsp;peril.</P>
      <P>Our leaders, in sum, must find a way to untie their tongues on a topic 
      of world-historical importance. Fortunately, there are those near at hand 
      to whom they can turn for help in doing so. In 1968, anthropologist 
      Clifford Geertz wrote a book called <EM>Islam Observed</EM> in which he 
      compared and contrasted what were then the western and eastern extremes of 
      the House of Islam: Morocco and Indonesia. Since 1968, however, the 
      western extreme has moved westward from Morocco to North America and, in 
      fact, all the way to California. So far, no paper trail has connected the 
      September&nbsp;11 terrorists to any American or Canadian mosque, and there 
      is every reason to believe that Osama bin Laden's contempt for the 
      acculturated Muslim communities of North America is total. But in the 
      years and decades ahead, why may it not be the voice of these Western 
      Muslim communities rather than his voice that is heard most loudly in the 
      world <EM>umma?</EM> Rather than the enemy within, the Muslims of the West 
      should be seen as the ally within.</P>
      <P>Muslims often, alas, have reason to fear other Muslims. The bloodiest 
      war of the latter half of the twentieth century, surpassing even the 
      genocide in Rwanda, was the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. For American and 
      other Western Muslims who dare to claim an international role, the 
      personal risks may be as large as the intellectual challenge. But if this 
      community of often recent immigrants can rise to the historic challenge, 
      the good news is that they will not be without allies in the House of 
      Islam. Is there a single Muslim nation in the world that aspires to the 
      condition of Afghanistan? Is there not good reason to believe that an 
      authentically Western and authentically Muslim voice would find a wide 
      audience? Time will tell, but the enemies of our enemy may yet prove to be 
      the friends of our Muslim friends.</P>
      <P>If American Muslims, clearly a key community at this juncture, can 
      muster the necessary courage and intelligence, the question that must then 
      be asked is: Will they find correspondingly courageous and appropriately 
      educated allies in Washington -- allies for whom theology is not 
      "theology"? To make the needed difference, the Muslim communities of the 
      West must be dignified with much more than the occasional courtesy 
      invitation to the diplomatic dinner table. They must be not just 
      cultivated as allies of convenience but heard and honored as teachers. 
      They must be protected and supported both materially and spiritually as 
      they take on the enormous challenge of raising from their own ranks the 
      leadership that will save two worlds at&nbsp;once.</P>
