            cooperation is the result of three factors. First, the fact of 
            differences among men and/or the geographical distribution of 
            nature-given factors of production. Second, the fact of higher 
            productivity achieved under the division of labor based on the 
            mutual recognition of private property (the exclusive control of 
            every man over his own body and his physical appropriations and 
            possessions) as compared to either self-sufficient isolation or 
            aggression, plunder and domination. And third, the human ability to 
            recognize this latter fact. But for the higher productivity of labor 
            performed under divison of labor and the human ability to recognize 
            this fact, explains Ludwig von Mises, "men would have forever 
            remained deadly foes of one another, irreconcilable rivals in their 
            endeavors to secure a portion of the scarce supply of means of 
            sustenance provided by nature. Each man would have been forced to 
            view all other men as his enemies; his craving for the satisfaction 
            of his own appetites would have brought him into an implacable 
            conflict with all his neighbors. No sympathy could possibly develop 
            under such a state of affairs." [<I><A

            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The higher productivity achieved under the division of labor 
            and the human ability to recognize this fact explains the origin of 
            the most elementary and fundamental of human institutions: the 
            family and the family household. Second, it explains the fact of 
            neighborhood (community) among homogeneous people (families, clans, 
            tribes): of neighborhood in the form of adjacent properties owned by 
            separate and equal owners and neighborhood in the unequal form of 
            the relationship characteristic of a father and his son, a landlord 
            and his tenant, or a community founder and his follower-residents. 
            Third and most important for our purposes, it explains the 
            possibility of the peaceful coexistence of heterogeneous and alien 
            communities. Even if the members of different communities find each 
            other physically and/or behaviorally strange, irritating, annoying 
            or worse, and do not want to associate as neighbors, they may still 
            engage in mutually beneficial trade if they are spatially separated 
            from each other. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Let me clarify this picture and assume the existence of 
            different races, ethnicities, languages, religions, and cultures 
            (henceforth summarily: ethno-cultures). Based on the just mentioned 
            insight that "likes" associate with other likes and live spatially 
            separated from "unlikes," the following picture emerges: People of 
            one ethno-culture tend to live in closer proximity to one another 
            and spatially separated and distant from people of another 
            ethno-culture. Whites live among Whites and separate from Asians and 
            Blacks. Italian speakers live among other Italians and separate from 
            English speakers. Christians live among other Christians and 
            separate from Muslims. Catholics live among Catholics and separate 
            from Protestants, etc. Naturally, some "overlap" and "mixing" of 
            different ethno-cultures in various "border-territories" exists. 
            Moreover, as centers of interregional trade, cities naturally 
            display a higher degree of ethno-cultural heterogeneity. This not 
            withstanding, however, every neighborhood and community is 
            internally homogeneous (uni-cultural). In fact, even in border 
            territories and cities the spatial association and separation of 
            likes and unlikes to be found in the macrocosm finds its microcosmic 
            equivalent. Nothing like a society where members of different 
            ethno-cultures live as neighbors or in close physical proximity to 
            each other (as propagated by some American multiculturalists) will 
            emerge. Rather, the emerging multiculturalism is one in which many 
            distinctly different ethno-cultures coexist in physical-spatial 
            separation and distant from one another, and trade with each other 
            from afar.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Let us take one more step and assume that all property is 
            owned privately and the entire globe is settled. Every piece of 
            land, every house and building, every road, river, and lake, every 
            forest and mountain, and all of the coastline is owned by private 
            owners or firms. No such thing as "public" property or "open 
            frontier" exists. And let us take a look at the problem of migration 
            under this scenario of a "natural order."</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>First and foremost, there is no such thing as "freedom of 
            migration" in a natural order. People cannot move about as they 
            please. Wherever a person moves, he moves on private property; and 
            private ownership implies the owner&rsquo;s right to include as well as to 
            exclude others from his property. Essentially, a person can move 
            only if he is invited by a recipient property owner, and this 
            recipient-owner can revoke his invitation and expel his invitees 
            whenever he deems their continued presence on his property 
            undesirable (in violation of his visitation code). </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>There will be plenty of movement under this scenario, because 
            there are powerful reasons to include: to open access to one&rsquo;s 
            property; but there are also reasons to exclude: to restrict or 
            close access. Those who are the most inclusive are the owners of 
            roads, railway stations, harbors, and airports, for example. 
            Interregional movement is their business. Accordingly, their 
            admission standards can be expected to be low, typically requiring 
            no more than the payment of a user fee. However, even they would not 
            follow a completely non-discriminatory admission policy. For 
            instance, they would exclude intoxicated or unruly people, beggars, 
            and bums from their property, and they may videotape or otherwise 
            monitor or screen their customers while on their 
property.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The situation for the owners of retail establishments, 
            hotels, and restaurants is similar. They are in the business of 
            selling and renting and thus offer easy access to their property. 
            They have every economic incentive <I>not</I> to discriminate 
            unfairly against "strangers" or "foreigners," because this would 
            lead to reduced profits, or losses. However, they must be 
            significantly more circumspect and restrictive in their admission 
            policy than the owners of roads or airports. They must take into 
            account the local-domestic repercussions that the presence of 
            strangers may have. If local-domestic sales suffer due to a 
            retailer&rsquo;s or hotel&rsquo;s open admission policy vis-a-vis foreigners, 
            then discrimination <I>is</I> economically justified. In order to 
            overcome this possible problem, then, commercial establishments can 
            be expected to require of their "foreign" visitors at a minimum 
            adherence to local standards of conduct and appearance.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The situation is similar for local employers. They prefer 
            lower to higher wage rates; hence, they are not predisposed against 
            foreigners. However, they must be sensitive to the repercussions on 
            the local labor force that may result from the employment of 
            foreigners; that is, they must be fearful of the possibility that an 
            ethno-culturally heterogeneous work force might lead to lower 
            productivity. Moreover, employment requires housing, and it is in 
            the residential housing and real estate market where discrimination 
            against and exclusion of ethno-cultural strangers will tend to be 
            most pronounced. For it is in the area of <I>residential</I> as 
            contrasted to commercial property where the human desire to be 
            private, secluded and protected and undisturbed from external events 
            and intrusions, is most pronounced. The value of residential 
            property to its owner depends essentially on its almost total 
            exclusivity. Only family members, and occasionally friends, are 
            included. And if residential property is located in a neighborhood, 
            this desire for undisturbed possession &ndash; peace and privacy &ndash; is best 
            accomplished by a high degree of ethno-cultural homogeneity (as this 
            lowers transaction costs while simultaneously increasing protection 
            from external disturbances and intrusions). In renting or selling 
            residential property to strangers (and especially to strangers from 
            ethno-culturally distant quarters) heterogeneity is introduced into 
            the neighborhood. Transaction costs tend to increase, and the 
            peculiar peace-and-privacy-security &ndash; the freedom from external, 
            foreign intrusions &ndash; sought and expected of residential property 
            tends to fall, resulting in lower residential property 
            values.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Under the scenario of a natural order, then, it can be 
            expected that there will be plenty of interregional trade and 
            travel. But owing to the natural discrimination against 
            ethno-cultural strangers in the area of residential housing and real 
            estate there will be little actual migration, i.e., permanent 
            resettlement. And whatever little migration there is, it will be by 
            individuals who are more or less completely assimilated to their 
            newly adopted community and its ethno-culture.</FONT></P>

            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Let me now introduce the institution of a State.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The definition of a State assumed here is rather 
            uncontroversial: A State is an agency which possesses an exclusive 
            monopoly of ultimate decision-making and conflict arbitration within 
            a given territory. In particular, a State can insist that all 
            conflicts involving itself be adjudicated by itself or its agents. 
            And implied in the power to exclude all others from acting as 
            ultimate judge, as the second defining element of a State, is its 
            power to tax: to unilaterally determine the price justice seekers 
            must pay to the State for its services as the monopolistic provider 
            of law and order.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Certainly, based on this definition it is easy to understand 
            why there might be a desire to establish a State. Not, as we are 
            told in kindergarten, in order to attain the "common good" or 
            because there would be no order without a State, but for a reason 
            far more selfish and base. For he who is a monopolist of final 
            arbitration within a given territory can <I>make</I> and 
            <I>create</I> laws in his own favor rather than recognize and apply 
            existing law; and he who can legislate can also tax and thus enrich 
            himself at the expense of impoverishing others.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>I cannot cover here the fascinating question of how such an 
            extraordinary institution as a State with the power to legislate and 
            tax can possibly arise, except to note that ideologies and 
            intellectuals have a lot to do with it. Rather, I will assume states 
            as "given" (as in fact they are) and consider the changes as regards 
            migration that result from their existence.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>First, with the establishment of a state and territorially 
            defined state borders, "immigration" takes on an entirely new 
            meaning. In a natural order, immigration is a person&rsquo;s migration 
            from one neighborhood-community into a different one 
            (micro-migration). In contrast, under statist conditions immigration 
            is immigration by "foreigners" from across state borders, and the 
            decision whom to exclude or include, and under what conditions, 
            rests not with a multitude of independent private property owners or 
            neighborhoods of owners, but with a single central (and 
            centralizing) state-government as the ultimate sovereign of all 
            domestic residents and regarding all of their properties 
            (macro-migration). Now, if a domestic resident-owner invites a 
            person and arranges for his access onto his property but the 
            government excludes this person from the state territory, this is a 
            case of <I>forced exclusion</I> (a phenomenon that does not exist in 
            a natural order). On the other hand, if the government admits a 
            person while there is no domestic resident-owner who has invited 
            this person onto his property, this is a case of <I>forced 
            integration</I> (also non-existent in a natural order, where all 
            movement is <I>invited</I>).</FONT></P>
            <P align=center><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3><B>III</B></FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>In order to comprehend the significance of this change from 
            decentralized admission by a multitude of property owners and 
            owner-associations (micro-migration) to centralized admission by a 
            state (macro-migration), and in particular in order to grasp the 
            potentialities of forced integration under statist conditions, it is 
            necessary first to briefly consider a state&rsquo;s policy of 
            <I>domestic</I> migration. Based on the state&rsquo;s definition as a 
            territorial monopolist of legislation and taxation and the 
            assumption of "self-interest," the basic features of its policy can 
            be predicted.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Most fundamentally, it can be predicted that the state&rsquo;s 
            agents will be interested in increasing (maximizing) tax revenues 
            and/or expanding the range of legislative interference with 
            established private property rights, but they will have little or no 
            interest in actually doing what a state is supposed to do: 
            protecting private property owners and their property from domestic 
            and foreign invasion.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>More specifically, because taxes and legislative interference 
            with private property rights are not paid and accepted voluntarily 
            but are met with resistance, a state, to assure its own power to tax 
            and legislate, must have an existential interest in providing its 
            agents access to everyone and all property within the state&rsquo;s 
            territory. In order to accomplish this, a state must take control of 
            (expropriate) all existing private roads and then use its tax 
            revenue to construct more and additional "public" roads, places, 
            parks and lands, ultimately until everyone&rsquo;s private property 
            borders onto or is encircled by public lands and roads.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Many economists have argued that the existence of public 
            roads indicates an imperfection of the natural &ndash; free market &ndash; 
            order. According to them, the free market "under-produces" the 
            so-called "public" good of roads; and tax-funded public roads 
            rectify this deficiency and enhance overall economic efficiency (by 
            facilitating interregional movement and trade and lowering 
            transaction costs). Obviously, this is a somewhat starry-eyed view 
            of things. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Free markets <I>do</I> produce roads, although they may well 
            produce less and different roads than under statist conditions. And 
            as viewed from the perspective of a natural order, the increased 
            production of roads under statist conditions represents not an 
            improvement but an "over-production" or better yet "mal-production" 
            of roads. Public roads are not simply innocent and harmless 
            facilitators of interregional exchange. First and foremost they are 
            facilitators of state taxation and control. On public roads the 
            government&rsquo;s taxmen, police, and military can proceed directly to 
            everyone&rsquo;s doorstep.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>In addition, public roads and lands lead to a distortion and 
            artificial break-up of the spatial association and separation 
            characteristic of a natural order. As explained, there are reasons 
            to be close and inclusive, but there are also reasons to be 
            physically distant and separated from others. The over-production of 
            roads occurring under statist conditions means on the one hand that 
            different communities are brought into greater proximity to one 
            another than they would have preferred (on grounds of demonstrated 
            preference). On the other hand, it means that one coherent community 
            is broken up and divided by public roads.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Moreover, under the particular assumption of a 
            <I>democratic</I> state even more specific predictions can be made. 
            Almost by definition, a state&rsquo;s territory extends over several 
            ethno-culturally heterogeneous communities, and dependent on 
            recurring popular elections, a state-government will predictably 
            engage in redistributive policies. In an ethno-culturally mixed 
            territory this means playing one race, tribe, linguistic or 
            religious group against another; one class within anyone of these 
            groups against another (the rich vs. the poor, the capitalists vs. 
            the workers, etc.); and finally, mothers against fathers and 
            children against parents. The resulting income and wealth 
            redistribution is complex and varied. There are simple transfer 
            payments from one group to another, for instance. However, 
            redistribution also has a spatial aspect. In the realm of spatial 
            relations it finds expression in an ever more pervasive network of 
            non-disciminatory "affirmative action" policies imposed on private 
            property owners.</FONT></P>

            size=3>An owner&rsquo;s right to exclude others from his property is the 
            means by which he can avoid "bads" from happening: events that will 
            lower the value of his property to him. By means of an unceasing 
            flood of redistributive legislation, the democratic state has worked 
            relentlessly not only to strip its citizens of all arms (weapons) 
            but also to strip domestic property owners of their right of 
            exclusion, thereby robbing them of much of their personal and 
            physical protection. Commercial property owners such as stores, 
            hotels, and restaurants are no longer free to exclude or restrict 
            access as they see fit. Employers can no longer hire or fire who 
            they wish. In the housing market, landlords are no longer free to 
            exclude unwanted tenants. Furthermore, restrictive covenants are 
            compelled to accept members and actions in violation of their very 
            own rules and regulations. In short, forced integration is 
            ubiquitous, making all aspects of life increasingly 
            unpleasant.</FONT></P>

            size=3>Before this backdrop of domestic state policies we can return 
            to the problem of immigration under statist conditions. It is now 
            clear what state admission implies. It does not merely imply 
            centralized admission. By admitting someone onto its territory, the 
            state also permits this person to proceed on public roads and lands 
            to every domestic resident&rsquo;s doorsteps, to make use of all public 
            facilities and services (such as hospitals and schools), and to 
            access, protected by a multitude of non-discrimination laws, every 
            commercial establishment, employment, and residential housing.

            size=3>Only one more element is missing in my reconstruction. Why 
            would <I>immigration</I> ever be a problem for a state? Who would 
            want to migrate from a natural order into a statist area? A statist 
            area would tend to lose its residents, especially its most 
            productive subjects. It would be an attraction only for potential 
            state-welfare recipients (whose admission would only further 
            strengthen the emigration tendency). If anything, there is an 
            <I>emigration</I> problem for a state. In fact, the institution of a 
            state is a <I>cause</I> of emigration; and indeed, it is the most 
            important or even the sole cause of <I>mass</I> migrations (more

            earthquake or flood). </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>What has been missing in our reconstruction is the assumption 
            of a multitude of states partitioning the entire globe (the absence 
            of natural orders anywhere). Then, as one state causes mass 
            emigration, another state will be confronted with the problem of 
            mass immigration; and the general direction of mass migration 
            movements will be from territories where states exploit 
            (legislatively expropriate and tax) their subjects more (and wealth 
            accordingly tends to be lower) to territories where states exploit 
            less (and wealth is higher).</FONT></P>

            size=3>We have finally arrived in the present, when the Western 
            world &ndash; Western Europe, North America, and Australia &ndash; is faced with 
            the specter of state-caused mass immigration from all over the rest 
            of the world. What is being &ndash; and what can be &ndash; done about this 
            situation?</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Out of sheer self-interest states will not put up no defense 
            at all against uninvited intruders (that is: declare an "open 
            border" policy). Otherwise, the influx of immigrants would quickly 
            assume such proportions that the domestic state-welfare system would 
            collapse (apart from other problems such as popular resistance and 
            unrest). On the other hand, the Western welfare states do not 
            prevent tens or even hundreds of thousands (and in the case of the 
            United States well in excess of a million) of uninvited foreigners 
            per year from entering and settling their territories. Moreover, as 
            far as legal (rather than tolerated illegal) immigration is 
            concerned, the Western welfare states have adopted a 
            non-discriminatory "affirmative action" admission policy. That is, 
            they set a maximum immigration target and then allot quotas to 
            various emigration countries or regions, irrespective of how 
            ethno-culturally similar or dissimilar such places and regions of 
            origin are, thus further aggravating the problem of forced 
            integration.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>In light of the unpopularity of this policy, one might wonder 
            about the motive for engaging in it. However, given the nature of 
            the state it is not difficult to discover such a rationale. States, 
            as will be recalled, are also promoters of forced domestic 
            integration. Forced integration is a means of breaking up all 
            intermediate social institutions and hierarchies (in between the 
            state and the individual) such as family, clan, tribe, community, 
            and church and their internal layers and ranks of authority. In so 
            doing the individual is isolated (atomized) and its power of 
            resistance vis-a-vis the state weakened. In the "logic" of the 
            state, a good dose of foreign invasion, especially if it comes from 
            strange and far-away places, is reckoned to further strengthen this 
            tendency. And the present situation offers a particularly opportune 
            time to do so, for in accordance with the inherently centralizing 
            tendency of states and statism generally and promoted here and now 
            in particular by the U.S. as the world&rsquo;s only remaining superpower, 
            the Western world &ndash; or more precisely the 
            neoconservative-socialdemocratic elites controlling the state 
            governments in the U.S. and Western Europe &ndash; is committed to the 
            establishment of supra-national states (such as the European Union) 
            and ultimately one world state. National, regional or communal 
            attachments are the main stumbling block on the way toward this 
            goal. A good measure of uninvited foreigners and government imposed 
            multiculturalism is calculated to further weaken and ultimately 
            destroy national, regional, and communal identities and thus promote 
            the goal of a One World Order, led by the U.S., and a new "universal 
            man."</FONT></P>

            and regain security and protection from invasion, whether foreign or

            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Let me begin with a proposal made by the editors of the 
            <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, the Cato Institute, and various 
            left-libertarian writers of an "open" or "no" border policy &ndash; not 
            because this proposal has any merit. To the contrary, it helps to 
            bring out clearly what the problem is and what needs to be done to 
            solve it.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>It is not difficult to predict the consequences of an open 
            border policy in the present world. If Switzerland, Austria, Germany 
            or Italy, for instance, freely admitted everyone who made it to 
            their borders and demanded entry, these countries would quickly be 
            overrun by millions of third-world immigrants from Albania, 
            Bangladesh, India, Nigeria, for example. As the more perceptive 
            open-border advocates realize, the domestic state-welfare programs 
            and provisions would collapse as a consequence. This would not be a 
            reason for concern; for surely, in order to regain effective 
            protection of person and property, the welfare state must be 
            abolished. But then comes the great leap &ndash; or the gaping hole &ndash; in 
            the open border argument. Somehow, out of the ruins of the 
            democratic welfare states, we are supposed to believe, a new natural 
            order will emerge.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The first error involved in this line of reasoning can be 
            readily identified. Once the welfare states have collapsed under 
            their own weight, the masses of immigrants who have brought this 
            about are still there. They have not been miraculously transformed 
            into Swiss, Austrians, Bavarians or Lombards, but remain what they 
            are: Zulus, Hindus, Ibos, Albanians, or Bangladeshis. Assimilation 
            can work when the number of immigrants is small. It is entirely 
            impossible, however, if immigration occurs on a mass scale. In that 
            case, immigrants will simply transport their own ethno-culture onto 
            the new territory. Accordingly, when the welfare state has imploded 
            there will be a multitude of "little" (or not so little) Calcuttas, 
            Daccas, Lagos&rsquo;, and Tiranas strewn all over Switzerland, Austria and 
            Italy. It betrays a breathtaking sociological naivitee to believe 
            that out of this admixture a natural order will emerge. Based on all 
            historical experience with such forms of multiculturalism, and given 
            the existence of a state that intrudes into every aspect of social 
            and economic life, it can safely be predicted instead that the 
            result will be civil war. There will be wide-spread plundering and 
            squattering leading to massive capital consumption, and civilization 
            as we know it would disappear from Switzerland, Austria and Italy. 
            Furthermore, the host population will quickly be outbred and 
            ultimately physically displaced by their "guests." There will be 
            still Alps in Austria and Switzerland, but no Austrians or 
            Swiss.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>However, the error of the open border proposal goes further 
            than its dire consequences. The fundamental error of the proposal is 
            moral or ethical in nature and lies in its assumption. It is the 
            underlying assumption that foreigners are "entitled," or have a 
            "right," to immigrate. In fact, they have no such right 
            whatsoever.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Foreigners would have a right to enter Switzerland, Austria 
            or Italy only if these places were uninhabited (unowned) 
            territories. However, they <I>are</I> owned, and no one has a right 
            to enter territories owned by others (unless invited by the owner). 
            Nor is it permissible to argue, as some open border proponents have 
            done, that while foreigners may not enter <I>private</I> property 
            without the owner&rsquo;s permission they may do so with <I>public</I> 
            property. In their eyes, public property is akin to unowned property 
            and thus "open" to everyone, domestic citizen and foreigners alike. 
            But this analogy between public property and unowned resources is 
            mistaken. There exists a categorical difference between unowned 
            resources (open frontier) and public property. Public property is 
            the result of state-government confiscations &ndash; of legislative 
            expropriations and/or taxation &ndash; of originally privately owned 
            property. While the state does not <I>recognize</I> anyone as its 
            private owner, all of government controlled public property has in 
            fact been brought about by the tax-paying members of the domestic 
            public. Austrians, Swiss, and Italians, in accordance with the 
            amount of taxes paid by each citizen, have funded the Austrian, 
            Swiss, and Italian public property. Hence, they must be considered 
            its legitimate owners. Foreigners have not been subject to domestic 
            taxation and expropriation; hence, they cannot be assumed to have 
            any rights regarding Austrian, Swiss or Italian public 
            property.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>The recognition of the moral status of public property as 
            expropriated private property is not only sufficient grounds for 
            rejecting the open border proposal. It is equally important for 
            combatting the present semi-open "affirmative action" immigration 
            policies of the Western welfare states.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Until now, in the debate on immigration policy too much 
            emphasis has been placed on consequentialist (utilitarian) 
            arguments. Apologists of the <I>status quo</I> have argued that most 
            immigrants become productive and work and hence immigration 
            contributes to rising domestic standards of living. Against this 
            critics have argued that the existing state-welfare institutions and 
            provisions increasingly invite welfare-immigration, and they have 
            warned that the only advantage of the current policies over the open 
            border alternative is that the former will take decades until 
            leading ultimately to similarly dire effects as the latter will 
            produce within years. As important as the resolution of these issues 
            is, however, it is not decisive. The opposition against current 
            immigration policies is ultimately independent of whether 
            immigration will make per capita GDP (or similar statistical 
            measures) rise or fall. It is a matter of justice: of right and 
            wrong.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Understandably the democratic welfare states try to conceal 
            the <I>source</I> of public property (i.e., acts of expropriation). 
            However, they do acknowledge that public property is "somehow" the 
            property of the citizens and they are their citizens&rsquo; trustees in 
            regard to public property. Indeed, the state&rsquo;s <I>legitimacy</I> is 
            derived from its claim to protect its citizens and their property 
            from invaders, intruders, and trespassers domestic and foreign. 
            Regarding foreigners, this would require that the state act like the 
            gatekeepers in private gated communities: to check every newcomer 
            for an invitation and monitor his movement on route toward his final 
            destination. When it is pointed out and made clear that, contrary to 
            this, the government instead tolerates or even promotes the 
            intrusion and invasion of masses of aliens who by no stretch of the 
            imagination can be deemed welcome or invited by domestic residents, 
            this is or may become a threat to a government&rsquo;s legitimacy and 
            exert enough pressure for it to adopt a more restrictive and 
            discriminatory admission policy.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>But this can only be the beginning, for even if public 
            opinion induced the state to adopt an immigration stance more in 
            accordance with popular sentiments and justice, this would not 
            change the fact that the interests of private property owners and 
            those of the state as a territorial monopolist of legislation and 
            taxation are incompatible and in permanent conflict with each other. 
            A state is a contradiction in terms: a property protector who may 
            expropriate the property of the protected through legislation and 
            taxation. Predictably, a state will be interested in maximizing tax 
            revenues and power (the range of legislative interference with 
            private property rights) but disinterested in protecting anything 
            except itself. What we experience in the area of immigration is only 
            one aspect of a general problem. States are also supposed to protect 
            their citizen from domestic intrusions and invasions; yet as we have 
            seen they actually disarm them, encircle them, tax them, and strip 
            them of their right to exclusion, thus rendering them 
            <I>helpless</I>.</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Accordingly, the solution to the immigration problem is at 
            the same time the solution to the general problem inherent in the 
            institution of a state and public property. It involves the return 
            to a natural order by means of secession. To regain security from 
            domestic and foreign intrusion and invasion, the central nation 
            states will have to be decomposed into their constituent parts. The 
            Austrian and the Italian central state do not own Austrian and 
            Italian public property. Supposedly, they are its citizens&rsquo; 
            trustees. But they do not protect them and their property. Hence, 
            just as the Austrians and the Italians (and not foreigners) are the 
            owners of Austria and Italy, so by extension of the same principle 
            do the Carinthians and the Lombards (in accordance with individual 
            tax payments) own Carinthia and Lombardy, and the Bergamese Bergamo 
            (and not the Viennese and the Roman government). By means of 
            secession, the central state&rsquo;s public roads and lands are 
            repossessed by their genuine owners: provinces, cities, towns, 
            villages, neighborhoods, and ultimately private property owners and 
            ownership associations. The central state, stripped of its public 
            property, has no longer access and its laws no longer apply 
            anywhere. At the same time, the right to exclusion inherent in 
            private property and essential for personal security and protection 
            is returned into the hands of a multitude of independent private 
            decisionmaking units.</FONT></P>
