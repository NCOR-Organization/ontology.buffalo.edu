<P><BR>Leftist opposition to the war in Afghanistan faded in November and 
December of last year, not only because of the success of the war but also 
because of the enthusiasm with which so many Afghanis greeted that success. The 
pictures of women showing their smiling faces to the world, of men shaving their 
beards, of girls in school, of boys playing soccer in shorts: all this was no 
doubt a slap in the face to leftist theories of American imperialism, but also 
politically disarming. There was (and is) still a lot to worry about: refugees, 
hunger, minimal law and order. But it was suddenly clear, even to many opponents 
of the war, that the Taliban regime had been the biggest obstacle to any serious 
effort to address the looming humanitarian crisis, and it was the American war 
that removed the obstacle. It looked (almost) like a war of liberation, a 
humanitarian intervention.<BR><BR>But the war was primarily neither of these 
things; it was a preventive war, designed to make it impossible to train 
terrorists in Afghanistan and to plan and organize attacks like that of 
September 11. And that war was never really accepted, in wide sections of the 
left, as either just or necessary. Recall the standard arguments against it: 
that we should have turned to the UN, that we had to prove the guilt of al-Qaeda 
and the Taliban and then organize international trials, and that the war, if it 
was fought at all, had to be fought without endangering civilians. The last 
point was intended to make fighting impossible. I haven&rsquo;t come across any 
arguments that seriously tried to describe how this (or any) war could be fought 
without putting civilians at risk, or to ask what degree of risk might be 
permissible, or to specify the risks that American soldiers should accept in 
order to reduce the risk of civilian deaths. All these were legitimate issues in 
Afghanistan, as they were in the Kosovo and Gulf wars. But among last fall&rsquo;s 
antiwar demonstrators, &ldquo;Stop the bombing&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t a slogan that summarized a 
coherent view of the bombing--or of the alternatives to it. The truth is that 
most leftists were not committed to having a coherent view about things like 
that; they were committed to opposinf the war, and they were prepared to oppose 
it without regard to its causes or character and without any visible concern 
about preventing future terrorist attacks.<BR><BR>A few left academics have 
tried to figure out how many civilians actually died in Afghanistan, aiming at 
as high a figure as possible, on the assumption, apparently, that if the number 
is greater than the number of people killed in the Towers, the war is unjust. At 
the moment, most of the numbers are propaganda; there is no reliable accounting. 
But the claim that the numbers matter in just this way, that the 3120th death 
determines the injustice of the war, is in any case wrong. It denies one of the 
most basic and best understood moral distinctions: between premeditated murder 
and unintended killing. And the denial isn&rsquo;t accidental, as if the people making 
it just forgot about, or didn&rsquo;t know about, the everyday moral world. The denial 
is willful: unintended killing by Americans in Afghanistan counts as murder. 
This can&rsquo;t be true anywhere else, for anybody else.<BR><BR>The radical failure 
of the left&rsquo;s response to the events of last fall raises a disturbing question: 
can there be a decent left in a superpower? Or more accurately, in the only 
superpower? Maybe the guilt produced by living in such a country and enjoying 
its privileges makes it impossible to sustain a decent (intelligent, 
responsible, morally nuanced) politics. Maybe festering resentment, ingrown 
anger, and self-hate are the inevitable result of the long years spent in 
fruitless opposition to the global reach of American power. Certainly, all those 
emotions were plain to see in the left=s reaction to September 11, in the 
failure to register the horror of the attack or to acknowledge the human pain it 
caused, in the schadenfreude of so many of the first responses, the barely 
concealed glee that the imperial state had finally gotten what it deserved. Many 
people on the left recovered their moral balance in the weeks that followed; 
there is at least the beginning of what should be a long process of 
self-examination. But many more have still not brought themselves to think about 
what really happened. <BR><BR>Is there any way of escaping the politics of guilt 
and resentment on the home ground of a superpower? We might begin to worry about 
this question by looking at oppositional politics in older imperial states. I 
can&rsquo;t do that in any sustained way (historians take note), only very sketchily. 
The Boer War is a good place to begin, because of the fierce opposition it 
aroused in England--which wasn&rsquo;t marked, despite the cruelty of the war, by the 
kind of self-hate that we have seen on the American left. Nor were the &ldquo;little 
Englanders&rdquo; hostile to English politics and culture; they managed to take a 
stand against the empire without alienating themselves from its home country. 
Indeed, they were more likely to regard England as the home country of 
liberalism and parliamentary democracy. After all, the values of parliamentarism 
(self-government, free speech, the right of opposition) did not support imperial 
rule. George Orwell&rsquo;s defense of patriotism seems to me an actual description of 
the feelings of many English liberals and leftists before his time and after 
(even of the Marxists, some of the best of whom were historians, like E.P. 
Thompson, who wrote sympathetically, indeed romantically, about the English 
people). Later on, during the Thatcher years, and particularly during the 
Falklands War, the tone of the opposition was more bitter, but by then there was 
no empire, only sour memories. <BR><BR>I think that the French story is similar. 
For most of the imperial years, French leftists were as proud of their 
Frenchness as were people on the right--and perhaps with more justification. For 
wasn&rsquo;t France the birthplace of enlightenment, universal values, and human 
rights? The Algerian war gave rise to a more familiar self-hatred, most clearly 
manifest in Jean-Paul Sartre&rsquo;s defense of FLN terrorism (in his preface to Franz 
Fanon&rsquo;s Wretched of the Earth): &ldquo;To shoot down a European is to kill two birds 
with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same 
time: there remains a dead man and a free man.&rdquo; This suggests that it is 
actually a good thing to kill Europeans (they were mostly French), but Sartre 
did not volunteer to go himself and be killed so that one more Algerian would be 
a free man. His was a generalized, not a personal, self-hatred. <BR><BR>Why 
shouldn&rsquo;t the American story be like these two, with long years of healthy 
oppositionist politics, and only episodic resentment? Wasn&rsquo;t America a beacon of 
light to the old world, a city on a hill, an unprecedented experiment in 
democratic politics? I grew up with the Americanism of the popular front in the 
1930s and 1940s; I look back on it now and think that the Communist Party=s 
effort to create a leftist pop culture, in an instant, as the party line turned, 
was kitchy and manipulative--and also politically very smart. Paul Robeson&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Ballad for Americans,&rdquo; whatever the quality of the music, provides at least a 
sense of what an unalienated American radicalism might be like. The days after 
September 11 would not have been a bad time for a popular front. What had 
happpened that made anything like that unthinkable?<BR><BR>The cold war, 
imperial adventures in Central America, Vietnam above all, and then the 
experience of globalization under American leadership: all these, for good 
reasons and bad, produced a pervasive leftist view of the United States as 
global bully, rich, privileged, selfish, hedonistic, and corrupt beyond remedy. 
The sense of a civilizing mission, which must have sustained parts of the 
British and French left in a more fully imperial setting (read John Stuart Mill 
on British India), never got off the ground here. Foreign aid, the Peace Corps, 
and nation-building never took on the dimensions of a &ldquo;mission&rdquo;; they were 
mostly sidelines of U.S. foreign policy: underfunded, frequently in the shade of 
military operations. Certainly, there has been much to criticize in the policies 
of every U.S. government since World War II (see virtually any back issue of 
Dissent). And yet, the leftist critique--most clearly, I think, from the Vietnam 
years forward (from the time of &ldquo;Amerika,&rdquo; Viet Cong flags, and breathless trips 
to the North)--has been stupid, overwrought, grossly inaccurate. It is the 
product of what Philip Roth, in his novel I Married a Communist, aptly described 
as &ldquo;the combination of embitterment and not thinking.&rdquo; The left has lost its 
bearings. Why? <BR><BR>I will suggest four reasons, without claiming that this 
is an exhaustive list. It is nothing more than a rough argument, an attempt to 
begin a debate.<BR><BR><B>1) Ideology: the lingering effects of the Marxist 
theory of imperialism and of the third worldist doctrines of the 1960s and 
1970s.</B> We may think that we live in a post-ideological age, and maybe most 
of us do, but the traces of old ideologies can be found everywhere in the 
discourse of the left. Perhaps the most striking consequence is the inability of 
leftists to recognize or acknowledge the power of religion in the modern world. 
Whenever writers on the left say that the root cause of terror is global 
inequality or human poverty, the assertion is in fact a denial that religious 
motives really count. Theology, on this view, is just the temporary, colloquial 
idiom in which the legitimate rage of oppressed men and women is expressed. 
<BR><BR>A few brave leftists described the Taliban regime and the al-Qaeda 
movement as examples of &ldquo;clerical fascism,&rdquo; which at least gets the adjective 
right. And maybe &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; is close enough, even if this new politics doesn&rsquo;t 
look like the product of late capitalist degeneration. It gives the left a 
reason for opposing Islamic terror, which is an important achievement. But it 
would be better to find a reason in the realities of terrorism itself, in the 
idea of a holy war against the infidels, which is not the same thing as a war 
against inferior races or alien nations. In fact, Islamic radicalism is not, as 
fascism is, a racist or ultra-nationalist doctrine. Something else is going on, 
which we need to understand. <BR><BR>But ideologically primed leftists were 
likely to think that they already understood whatever needed to be understood. 
Any group that attacks the imperial power must be a representative of the 
oppressed, and its agenda must be the agenda of the left. It isn't necessary to 
listen to its spokesmen. What else can they want except...the redistribution of 
resources across the globe, the withdrawal of American soldiers from wherever 
they are, the closing down of aid programs for repressive governments, the end 
of the blockade of Iraq, and the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside 
Israel? I don&rsquo;t doubt that there is some overlap between this program and the 
dreams of al-Qaeda leaders--though al-Qaeda is not an egalitarian movement, and 
the idea that it supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict is crazy. The overlap is circumstantial and convenient, nothing more. A 
holy war against infidels is not, even unintentionally, unconsciously, or 
&ldquo;objectively,&rdquo; a left politics. But how many leftists can even imagine a holy 
war against infidels?<BR><BR><B>2. Powerlessness and alienation: leftists have 
no power in the United States and most of us don't expect to exercise power, 
ever</B>. Many left intellectuals live in America like internal aliens, refusing 
to identify with their fellow citizens, regarding any hint of patriotic feeling 
as politically incorrect. That&rsquo;s why they had such difficulty responding 
emotionally to the attacks of September 11 or joining in the expressions of 
solidarity that followed. Equally important, that&rsquo;s why their participation in 
the policy debate after the attacks was so odd; their proposals (turn to the UN, 
collect evidence against bin Laden, and so on) seem to have been developed with 
no concern for effectiveness and no sense of urgency. They talked and wrote as 
if they could not imagine themselves responsible for the lives of their 
fellow-citizens. That was someone else&rsquo;s business; the business of the left 
was...what? To oppose the authorities, whatever they did. The good result of 
this opposition was a spirited defense of civil liberties. But even this defense 
displayed a certain willful irresponsibility and ineffectiveness, because so 
many leftists rushed to the defense of civil liberties while refusing to 
acknowledge that the country faced real dangers--as if there was no need at all 
to balance security and freedom. Maybe the right balance will emerge 
spontaneously from the clash of rightwing authoritarianism and leftwing 
absolutism, but it would be better practice for the left to figure out the right 
balance for itself, on its own; the effort would suggest a responsible politics 
and a real desire to exercise power, some day. <BR><BR>But what really marks the 
left, or a large part of it, is the bitterness that comes with abandoning any 
such desire. The alienation is radical. How else can one understand the 
unwillingness of people who, after all, live here, and whose children and 
grandchildren live here, to join in a serious debate about how to protect the 
country against future terrorist attacks? There is a pathology in this 
unwillingness, and it has already done us great damage.<BR><BR><B>3. The moral 
purism of blaming America first: many leftists seem to believe that this is like 
blaming oneself, taking responsibility for the crimes of the imperial state</B>. 
In fact, when we blame America, we also lift ourselves above the blameworthy 
(other) Americans. The left sets itself apart. Whatever America is doing in the 
world isn&rsquo;t our doing. In some sense, of course, that is true. The defeat of 
facism in the middle years of the twentieth century and of communism in the last 
years were not our doing. Some of us, at least, thought that these efforts 
merited our support--or our &ldquo;critical support.&rdquo; But this is a complicated and 
difficult politics, and it doesn&rsquo;t allow for the favorite posture of many 
American leftists: standing as a righteous minority, brave and determined, among 
the timid, the corrupt, and the wicked. A posture like that ensures at once the 
moral superiority of the left and its political failure. <BR><B><BR>4. The sense 
of not being entitled to criticize anyone else: how can we live here in America, 
the richest, most powerful, and most privileged country in the world, and say 
anything critical about people who are poorer and weaker than we are?</B> This 
was a major issue in the 1960s, when the New Left seemed to have discovered 
&ldquo;oppression&rdquo; for the first time, and we all enlisted on the side of oppressed 
men and women and failed, again and again, to criticize the authoritarianism and 
brutality that often scars their politics. There is no deeper impulse in left 
politics than this enlistment; solidarity with people in trouble seems to me the 
most profound commitment that leftists make. But this solidarity includes, or 
should include, a readiness to tell these people when we think they are acting 
wrongly, violating the values we share. Even the oppressed have obligations, and 
surely the first among these is not to murder innocent people, not to make 
terrorism their politics. Leftists who cannot insist upon this point, even to 
people poorer and weaker than themselves, have abandoned both politics and 
morality for something else. They are radical only in their abjection. That was 
Sartre&rsquo;s radicalism, face-to-face with FLN terror, and it has been imitated by 
thousands since, excusing and apologizing for acts that any decent left would 
begin by condemning.</P>
<P>What ought to be done? I have a modest agenda: put decency first, and then we 
will see. So, let&rsquo;s go back over my list of reasons for the current indecency. 
<BR>Ideology. We certainly need something better than the rag-tag Marxism with 
which so much of the left operates today--whose chief effect is to turn world 
politics into a cheap melodrama, with all the villains dressed to look the part 
and one villain larger than life. A tough materialist analysis would be fine, so 
long as it is sophisticated enough to acknowledge that material interests don't 
exhaust the possibilities of human motivation. The spectacle of European 
leftists straining to find some economic reason for the Kosovo war (oil in the 
Balkans? a possible pipeline? was NATO reaching for control of the Black Sea?) 
was entertaining at the time, but it doesn=t bear repeating. For the moment we 
can make do with a little humility, an openness to heterodox ideas, a sharp eye 
for the real world , and a readiness to attend to moral as well as materialist 
arguments. This last point is especially important. The encounter with Islamic 
radicalism, and with other versions of politicized religion, should help us 
understand that high among our interests are our values: secular enlightenment, 
human rights, and democratic government. Left politics starts with the defense 
of these three.<BR><BR>Alienation and powerlessness. It is a common idea on the 
left that political responsibility is something like temperance, moderation, and 
cleanliness--good bourgeois values that are incompatible with radical politics 
or incisive social criticism. You have to be a little wild to be a radical. That 
isn&rsquo;t a crazy idea, and alienated intellectuals may well have, more than anyone 
else, the anger necessary to begin the critical project and the lust for 
intellectual combat that sustains it. But they don't necessarily get things 
right, and the angrier they are and the more they are locked into their 
combative posture, the more likely they are to get things wrong. What was 
necessary after September 11, and what is necessary now, is an engagement with 
our fellow citizens that recognizes the fellowship. We can be as critical as we 
like, but these are people whose fate we share; we are responsible for their 
safety as they are for ours, and our politics has to reflect that mutual 
responsibility. When they are attacked, so are we; and we should join willingly 
and constructively in debates about how to defend the country. Once again: we 
should act as if we won&rsquo;t always be powerless.<BR>Blaming America first. Not 
everything that goes badly in the world goes badly because of us. The United 
States is not omnipotent, and its leaders should not be taken as co-conspirators 
in every human disaster. The left has little difficulty understanding the need 
for distributive justice with regard to resources, but we have been practically 
clueless about the just distribution of praise and blame. To take the obvious 
example: in the second half of the twentieth century, the United States fought 
both just and unjust wars, undertook both just and unjust interventions. It 
would be a useful exercise to work through the lists and test our capacity to 
make distinctions--to recognize, say, that the US was wrong in Guatemala in 1956 
and right in Kosovo in 1999. Why can&rsquo;t we accept an ambivalent relation to 
American power, acknowledging that it has had good and bad effects in the world? 
But shouldn&rsquo;t an internationalist left demand a more egalitarian distribution of 
power? Well, yes, in principle; but any actual redistribution will have to be 
judged by the quality of the states that would be empowered by it. Faced with 
states like, say, Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s Iraq, I don&rsquo;t think we have to support a 
global redistribution of political power.<BR><BR>Not blaming anyone else. The 
world (and this includes the third world) is too full of hatred, cruelty, and 
corruption for any left, even the American left, to suspend its judgement about 
what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s not the case that because we are privileged, we should 
turn inward and focus our criticism only on ourselves. In fact, inwardness is 
one of our privileges; it is often a form of political self-indulgence. Yes, we 
are entitled to blame the others whenever they are blameworthy; in fact, it is 
only when we do that, when we denounce, say, the authoritarianism of third world 
governments, that we will find our true comrades--the local opponents of the 
maximal leaders and military juntas, who are often waiting for our recognition 
and support. If we value democracy, we have to be prepared to defend it, at 
home, of course, but not only there.</P>
<P>I would once have said that we were well along: the American left has an 
honorable history, and we have certainly gotten some things right, above all, 
our opposition to domestic and global inequalities. But what the aftermath of 
September 11 suggests is that we have not advanced very far--and not always in 
the right direction. The left needs to begin again.</P>
