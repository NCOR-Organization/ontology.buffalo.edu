<CENTER>The World Trade Center Attack</CENTER>
<CENTER>And Vidal's Views on the Subject</B></H1></CENTER>
<P><IMG height=200 src="attack_files/perpetual.gif" width=125 align=right> 
<P><B>Immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, destruction on the World Trade 
Center twin towers, I began to receive e-mail queries from people who wanted to 
know what Gore Vidal had to say about the attack. Readers have also inquired 
about <EM>La fine della libertà: Verso un nuovo totalitarismo?,</EM> Vidal's 
Italian-language book - published in November 2001 - that includes an essay on 
the Sept. 11 attack. 
<P>I can now report that the Italian book - which begins with an essay about 
Sept. 11 that was to have appeared in Vanity Fair - will be published in English 
in March under the title <EM>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace: How We Got To Be 
So Hated</EM>. The publisher, Nation Books, will add some material to its 
edition, including a brief history of each article and something on censorship 
issues. You can purchase <EM>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace</EM> - the title 
comes from a term coined in 1947 by the American historian Charles A. Beard - 
directly through the web site of <A href="http://www.nationbooks.org/">Nation 
Books</A> when it's available, or you can most likely find a copy at your local 
bookstore. 
<P>"That our ruling junta might have seriously provoked McVeigh and Osama was 
never dealt with," Vidal writes in the book. "We consumers don't need to be told 
the why of anything. Certainly those of us who are in the why-business have a 
difficult time in getting through the corporate-sponsored American media, so I 
thought it useful to describe here the various provocations on our side that 
drove both bin Laden and McVeigh to such terrible acts." And he adds: "The 
awesome physical damage Osama and company did us is as nothing compared to the 
knock-out blow to our vanishing liberties." 
<P>Because of the provocative nature of his views on the Sept. 11 attacks, Vidal 
had a hard time finding an English-language publisher for his essay on the 
subject. Almost immediately after the attack, he began to write a piece for 
Vanity Fair, but the magazine subsequently decided not to print it. In 
mid-September, an early version of that piece appeared in an on-line publication 
in Brazil, and that Portuguese-language piece was subsequently translated into 
Spanish and published on the internet by a Mexican newspaper. Below are links to 
both of those pieces (which are, of course, in Portuguese and Spanish). 
<P><IMG height=250 src="attack_files/citalianlibertal.jpg" width=155 align=left> 

<P>In Italy, in November 2001, Vidal published <EM>La fine della libertà: Verso 
un nuovo totalitarismo?</EM>, which means, "the end of liberty: toward a new 
totalitarianism." This 120-page book, pictured here, consists of four essays in 
four chapters - three of which have already appeared as magazine essays - 
followed by six pages of endnotes explaining names and events from American 
history to the book's Italian readers. Chapter 1 of <EM>La fine della 
libertà</EM> is the above mentioned piece intended for publication in Vanity 
Fair. This chapter ends with a six-page chart that lists official American 
military operations around the world - including their names - beginning with 
the Berlin Airlift of 1948. Chapter 2 is a translation of Vidal's September 2001 
Vanity Fair piece on Timothy McVeigh (reprinted on <A 
href="http://www.geocities.com/gorevidal3000/tim.htm">this web site</A>, clearly 
in violation of Vidal's copyright.) Chapter 3 is Vidal's November 1998 Vanity 
Fair essay</A> on the loss of liberties in the U.S. And Chapter 4 is an essay 
entitled "The New Theocrats," which first appeared in The Nation on July 21, 
1997. These last two essays are reprinted in <EM>The Last Empire</EM>, Vidal's 
2001 essay collection. So there's really very little content in <EM>La fine 
della libertà</EM> that you can't get right now at a library. 
<P><IMG height=250 src="attack_files/0349115281.02.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" width=155 
align=right> In addition to <EM>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace</EM>, readers 
in the U.K. will soon be able to get an English-language copy of the new 
material in <EM>La fine della libertà</EM> in book form. Abacus, Vidal's U.K. 
paperback publisher, will issue an "expanded" edition of his U.S. essay 
collection <EM>The Last Empire</EM> (right) that will include the Vanity Fair 
essay on McVeigh and the rejected World Trade Center essay. American readers can 
order this book from any of a number of on-line U.K. internet booksellers. 
<P>If you read Italian, you can order <EM>La fine della libertà</EM> from <A

<P>For people interested in Vidal's views on The World Trade Center attack, I've 
put together the following list of internet links. Unfortunately, I've found no 
on-line essay or statement in English by Vidal, only a few interviews written by 
newspaper or magazine reporters. For his full views in English, you'll need to 
get a copy of <EM>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace</EM>. 
<P>Here, then, are the resources I can offer in which Vidal shares his views on 
the Sept. 11 attack: <A name=comments></A>
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Vidal's comments on the World Trade 
Center attacks appeared <A 
href="http://www.uol.com.br/folha/mundo/ult94u29441.shl">in Portuguese</A> a few 
days after the event when he shared his views with a Brazilian publication. 
Those comments were then <A 
href="http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/sep01/010919/006a1mun.html">translated 
into Spanish</A> and published in the Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Vidal later 
revised and expanded these early remarks for the Vanity Fair piece. The remarks 
now appear as the first chapter of both <EM>Perpetual War for Perpetual 
Peace</EM> and <EM>La fine della libertà</EM>. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Here's a piece in <A 
href="http://www.consider.net/forum_new.php3?newTemplate=OpenObject&amp;newTop=200110150010&amp;newDisplayURN=200110150010">The 
New Statesman</A> by reporter Johann Hari. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Another short interview piece in <A 
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4314323,00.html">the 
U.K.'s Guardian</A> includes comments on Sept. 11. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> In a piece from Reuters, Vidal <A 
href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/1124-04.htm">blasts the U.S.</A> 
for its international policies. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Here's an interview with Vidal in 
German in <A 
href="http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,158602,00.html">Der 
Spiegel</A> magazine. If you <A href="mailto:%20%20kloman@pitt.edu">send me an 
e-mail</A>, I can send you a translation of this interview done by a reader of 
my web site. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Ironically, here's a piece on Vidal 
that appeared in the Sept. 11, 2001, issue of the <A 
href="http://www.faz.net/IN/INtemplates/faznet/default.asp?tpl=uptoday/content.asp&amp;doc={F1ECB244-2D33-4F26-A740-08DE45802FCE}&amp;rub={76B8D537-8E0E-4970-B366-37AC8DAA545F}">Frankfurter

same publication</A> that ran in January 2001. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> If you have RealPlayer, here's an <A 
href="http://www.radio.rai.it/radio3/archivio_2001/audio/vidal.ram">interview on 
Italian radio</A> in English and Italian. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Another RealPlayer clip - this one in 
English - of <A 
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1535000/audio/_1539854_gore.ram">an 
interview on the BBC</A>. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> On a related matter, here are several 
outstanding video clips of Vidal and Noam Chomsky <A 
href="http://itsbeendone.com/noamvid.php">discussing the Gulf War.</A> This 
program, taped shortly after the end of the war, was intended for television but 
never aired. You'll need to download the clips, which are in the "asf" format. 
They require somewhat newer multi-media technology to play and will not play 
directly from the site. 
<P><IMG src="attack_files/blueball.gif"> Here is a <A 
href="http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/mcveigh.html">list of articles</A> that 
examine Vidal's involvement in the Timothy McVeigh case. His views on McVeigh 
were almost as controversial as his views on Sept. 11. 
<P>Finally, I would appreciating hearing from anyone who can offer links to any 
more of Vidal's comments on the World Trade Center attack or its aftermath. And
