                              size=3>In the fall of 1988, the journal 
                              <EM>Tikkun</EM> published an article called "The 
                              New Historiography: Israel Confronts Its Past." 
                              Its author was a relatively unknown historian 
                              named Benny Morris. A year before, Morris had 
                              brought out <EM>The Birth of the Palestinian 
                              Refugee Problem, 1947-1949</EM>, a richly and 
                              rigorously detailed book that had not yet made 
                              much of a splash. His <EM>Tikkun</EM> article 
                              would fix that. In his article, Morris described 
                              himself and three of his confederates (Avi Shlaim 
                              and Ilan Pappe from academia, and Simha Flappan 
                              from political journalism) as "new historians," 
                              arguing that they had together undertaken to 
                              expose the skeletons in Zionism's closet, to 
                              declare war on the dogmas of Israeli history. The 
                              label stuck, and soon the Israeli media was abuzz 
                              about the "new historians," who were catapulted 
                              into notoriety.</FONT></P>
                              <P><FONT face="times, times new roman, serif" 
                              size=3>Morris also accused Israel of creating the 
                              Palestinian refugee problem, a charge that he had 
                              not levelled in his book. In his view, Israel bore 
                              a terrible burden of guilt. The vehemence of his 
                              accusations, and the moralizing tone in which they 
                              were delivered, fell on receptive ears: Morris was 
                              writing in the inflamed days of the Intifada. It 
                              is unlikely that the scholarly tomes of Morris and 
                              his fellow revisionists had many readers, but many 
                              Israelis were exposed to their heterodoxies in the 
                              media, which relish positions that are brief and 
                              barbed. And in this respect the "new historians" 
                              certainly delivered the goods. Suddenly an 
                              argument raged over the true nature of what 
                              Israelis call the War of Independence, or what 
                              Palestinians call <EM>al-naqba</EM> or the 
                              Catastrophe, or what historians call, more 
                              neutrally, the 1948 war. That war furnished the 
                              founding myth of the state of Israel; and it is 
                              but a short step from questioning its justice to 
                              doubting Israel's very right to exist.</FONT></P>
                              <P><FONT face="times, times new roman, serif" 
                              size=3>In fact, the ideas advanced by Benny 
                              Morris, Avi Shlaim, and Ilan Pappe, the vanguard 
                              of the "new historians," were nothing new. An 
                              anti-narrative of Zionism, counterposed to the 
                              Zionist (and Israeli) narrative of Zionism, had 
                              existed since the very inception of the Zionist 
                              movement. Opponents of the movement, Jewish and 
                              non-Jewish, had created an entire literature 
                              explaining what was foul in Zionism and why 
                              Zionism was destined to fail, and later why the 
                              state of Israel was an illegitimate and unjust 
                              construct that had to be resisted. The Soviet 
                              propaganda machine excelled in developing this 
                              anti-narrative, and in proliferating it. Arab 
                              propaganda also did its work. And at the margins 
                              of the Israeli left, there had always been groups 
                              and currents that doubted the right of Israel to 
                              exist and stressed the wrongs that were 
                              perpetrated against the Arabs. Yet those heretical 
                              elements remained marginal in Israeli politics and 
                              culture, and failed to gain wide public support. 
                              The advent of the "new historians" changed all 
                              that. These views now gained a certain legitimacy, 
                              since they appeared in the context of a debate 
                              between ostensibly objective scholars.</FONT></P>

                              look at premises refreshes historical inquiry and 
                              helps to generate new understanding. Every 
                              generation reexamines the present and the past 
                              under the impact of changing realities. Sometimes 
                              revisionism is the result of a generational shift 
                              among historians, and sometimes it springs from 
                              dramatic historical developments that throw an 
                              unexpected light on the past. The Vietnam War led 
                              American historians to reconsider certain accepted 
                              accounts of the cold war. Forty years after the 
                              end of World War II, a heated debate flared among 
                              historians in Germany about how to interpret the 
                              Nazi era: was it a rupture in Germany's past, or 
                              evidence of its continuity? Some British 
                              historians have responded to the belligerence of 
                              Thatcherism by attempting to rehabilitate 
                              Chamberlain and the Munich agreement. To be sure, 
                              not all revisions are laudable; the denial of the 
                              Holocaust is also a variety of revisionism. But 
                              historical revisionism does not take place in a 
                              vacuum. It is surrounded by politics. The 
                              revisionist scholar feels obligated to a 
                              particular political purpose, and proceeds with 
                              his research, and sometimes with his ready 
                              conclusions, to substantiate that 
                              purpose.</FONT></P>

                              exactly pioneered fresh critical approaches in 
                              Israeli historiography. Already in the 1970s, 
                              scholars had begun to develop new and 
                              sophisticated views of Jewish-British relations 
                              under the Mandate, of Zionism's relation to the 
                              Arab problem, of the rise of the Arab national 
                              movement, of the nature of Zionism as the national 
                              liberation movement of the Jewish people. There 
                              was a tense and constant dialogue between 
                              collective memory and historical scholarship, as 
                              the new approaches slowly penetrated into the 
                              educational system and public consciousness. Since 
                              the advent of the "new historians," however, a new 
                              polarization has set in. For the "new historians" 
                              dismissed all previous historiography as 
                              apologetic. Whoever dares to oppose or to 
                              criticize the pronouncements of these self-styled 
                              iconoclasts is savagely maligned.</FONT></P>

                              Ephraim Karsh charged that Benny Morris had 
                              falsified certain documents, Morris did not even 
                              deign to reply; instead he asserted that Karsh's 
                              article on "re-writing Israel's history" was 
                              replete with distortions and half-truths, and he 
                              went on to add: "His piece contains more than 
                              fifty footnotes but is based almost entirely on 
                              references to and quotations from secondary works, 
                              many of them of dubious value." A look at Karsh's 
                              notes indicates that thirty of his references 
                              actually refer to writings by Shlaim and Morris, 
                              and fifteen others cite primary sources, and the 
                              rest refer to studies by major historians such as 
                              Avraham Selah and to several books by journalists 
                              that Morris himself now adduces in his new book. 
                              Of dubious value, indeed.</FONT></P>

                              over from history into sociology and cultural 
                              studies, as new topics and new heresies were added 
                              to those that treated the War of Independence and 
                              the relation to the Palestinians: the pre-state 
                              Jewish community in Palestine and its conduct 
                              during the Holocaust, the absorption of Holocaust 
                              survivors and Oriental Jewish immigrants, and so 
                              on. No longer were particular Zionist or Israeli 
                              figures impugned; Zionist ideology as a whole was 
                              now the real culprit. Several of the new school's 
                              devotees labelled themselves "post-Zionist," and 
                              charged that the "lunatic" ambition of Jews to 
                              transform themselves into a people with a state of 
                              their own was senseless, and opposed to the 
                              natural inclinations of the Jews. They claimed 
                              that the Jews had never been a people until the 
                              Zionists muddled their thinking, and had no desire 
                              for nationhood. Post-Zionism turned out to be a 
                              peculiar form of anti-Zionism. In contrast with 
                              the anti-Zionism of an earlier era, the 
                              post-Zionists made their peace with Israel's 
                              existence as a state. (It is hard to argue with 
                              success.) But they sought to undermine the state's 
                              moral and philosophical foundations, to dismantle 
                              the Jewish identity of the state and reconfigure 
                              it as a state of "all its citizens."</FONT></P>

                              own momentum, even when the realities that gave 
                              rise to them have changed. The controversy about 
                              "the new historians" began during Yitzhak Shamir's 
                              tenure as prime minister, while the Intifada raged 
                              and Israeli politics was gridlocked. The debate 
                              fumed on during the Gulf war, when some Israelis 
                              with post-Zionist sympathies felt compassion for 
                              the embattled Iraqi ruler. It continued into the 
                              years of Rabin's premiership, as a kind of atonal 
                              accompaniment to the Oslo accords. But Rabin's 
                              assassination in 1995 took the wind out of the 
                              confrontation over the new historiography; and it

                              controversy have appeared. Benny Morris and Avi 
                              Shlaim appear to have mellowed, casting off their 
                              anti-establishment tunics for academic gowns. 
                              Shlaim is professor at St. Antony's, Oxford and 
                              Morris, who liked to portray himself as the 
                              innocent victim of the Israeli scholarly guild, 
                              currently holds an appointment as professor at 
                              Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba. In both books, 
                              there are elements of Shlaim's and Morris's old 
                              and egregious views; but in both books there are 
                              also new elements, reflecting the changing times. 
                              About both books one can say that what is bad is 
                              not new and what is new is not bad.</FONT></P>

                              task, in a hefty tome each, of recounting the 
                              course of the Israeli-Arab dispute from its 
                              inception to the recent fall of the Netanyahu 
                              government. Shlaim devotes precious little space 
                              to the period prior to 1947, hastening on to the 
                              United Nations partition plan and the War of 
                              Independence; Morris accords nearly 200 pages to 
                              the period prior to the war in 1948. Shlaim is 
                              basically interested in political and diplomatic 
                              history, and minimizes his account of the wars; 
                              Morris treats the military operations in copious 
                              detail, in the War of Independence and in later 
                              conflicts.</FONT></P>

                              subjects of their previous research do Shlaim and 
                              Morris ground their investigation on primary 
                              sources. The books do not pretend to scholarly 
                              innovation. They wish only to present an 
                              interpretive synthesis of the secondary sources. 
                              Such an approach is certainly valid, especially 
                              when the era involved is so close to our own--so 
                              close, indeed, that there are times when you

                              against the "new historians" concerned their 
                              sparse use of Arab sources. In a preemptive move, 
                              Shlaim states at the outset of his new book that 
                              his focus is on Israeli politics and the Israeli 
                              role in relations with the Arab world--and thus he 
                              has no need of Arab documents. Morris claims that 
                              he is able to extrapolate the Arab positions from 
                              the Israeli documentation. Both authors make only 
                              meager use of original Arab sources, and most such 
                              references cited are in English

                              scholars, unlike the archives of the Arab states,

                              the Arab world almost exclusively on the basis of 
                              Israeli documentation results in obvious 
                              distortions. Every Israeli contingency plan, every 
                              flicker of a far-fetched idea expressed by David 
                              Ben-Gurion and other Israeli planners, finds its 
                              way into history as conclusive evidence for the 
                              Zionist state's plans for expansion. What we know 
                              about Nasser's schemes regarding Israel, by 
                              contrast, derives solely from secondary and 
                              tertiary sources. The same is true for the 
                              planning of defense ministers of Syria and their 
                              fantasies of a "Greater Syria." We are given no 
                              first-hand source for King Hussein's designs over 
                              the years other than what it was convenient for 
                              him to to tell Avi Shlaim in the ceremonious 
                              interview that he granted him not long before his 
                              death. (The somewhat fawning interview by this 
                              otherwise anti-Hashemite scholar appeared in 
                              <EM>The New York Review of Books</EM> last 
                              summer.) The upshot of all this methodological 
                              self-limitation is a history of the conflict in 
                              which one side completely disrobes, disclosing all 
                              its weaknesses and its flaws, while the other 
                              remains conveniently shrouded in the mystery of 
                              the veil.</FONT></P>

                              during the 1920s is replete with errors, as is 
                              Shlaim's brief foray into Israeli politics at the

                              Ben-Gurion as prime minister in 1963, Shlaim tries 
                              to explain why Eshkol was consistently a liberal 
                              and a humanist who understood the need for 
                              dialogue with the Arabs. This is itself a dubious 
                              proposition; but Shlaim links Eshkol's alleged 
                              dovishness to his emigration to Palestine in 1914 
                              as a representative of the left-wing youth

                              But Ha-Shomer ha-Tzair was founded after Eshkol 
                              came to Palestine, and Eshkol was never a member

                              explanation, on a patent error. This is 
                              reminiscent of the pseudopsychological

                              is another striking similarity between Morris's 
                              book and Shlaim's book, and it is their very 
                              superficial treatment of the implications of the 
                              cold war for the Middle East. More serious 
                              attention to this dimension of the conflict could 
                              have led to an entirely different interpretation 
                              of the Israeli-Arab dispute: namely, that its 
                              worsening from the 1950s on was a by-product of 
                              the Soviet Union's penetration of the region 
                              beneath the cloak of radical Arab nationalism. It 
                              is a fact, after all, that a genuine window of 
                              opportunity for peace between Israel and the Arabs 
                              opened only after the collapse of the Soviet Union 
                              and the loss of its support to states and 
                              organizations on the hard-line front of rejection. 
                              Morris claims that one of the factors that led to 
                              a softening in the PLO's stance was fears about 
                              the influx of a million Jews from the former 
                              Soviet Union; but surely the buckling of the 
                              Soviet Union had something to do with that, 
                              too.</FONT></P>

                              in the Middle East conflict makes it possible to 
                              present the conflict in isolation from world 
                              politics--that is, to present it moralistically. 
                              In both these books, there are two layers of 
                              research and argument: a deeper stratum, based on 
                              earlier research, that has a strong moralistic 
                              slant, and a newer level that expresses a more 
                              realistic approach to events. The older layer is 
                              far more ideological, and it is especially 
                              conspicuous in Shlaim's work. The evolution from 
                              moralism to realism is a reflection of the 
                              changing times in which these books were written, 
                              as the high tide of the peace process puts the 
                              past in a new light. These books start out as the 
                              story of the good guys and the bad guys, in the 
                              "new historical" manner, but somewhere along the 
                              way the plot thickens, as the writers' ideologies 
                              collide with the region's 
realities.</FONT></P><BR>

                              title of Avi Shlaim's book is an allusion to an 
                              article called "On the Iron Wall," by Zeev 
                              Jabotinsky, the Zionist leader and ideologue who 
                              founded the Revisionist movement in 1925. 
                              (Jabotinsky's famous essay was published in 
                              Russian in 1923 and in Hebrew in 1933.) The 
                              Revisionist movement functioned as the militant 
                              right wing of Zionism, and the Likud party views 
                              itself as the rightful heir of Jabotinsky's 
                              mantle. The concept of the "iron wall" posited 
                              that it was impossible in Palestine, as in any 
                              country of colonization, to avoid a clash between 
                              the indigenous population and the settlers. The 
                              Arabs of Palestine were a separate people, and 
                              they would not surrender the land without a 
                              struggle. Consequently, Jabotinsky argued, the 
                              only path forward for the Zionist project was the 
                              path of force: to erect an "iron wall" in the form 
                              of a Jewish battalion in the British army, which 
                              would halt Arab resistance.</FONT></P>

                              basic problem with Jabotinsky's conception was not 
                              philosophical, it was practical: there was no 
                              chance at all that the British would agree to 
                              setting up a Jewish army in British khaki. 
                              Jabotinsky's opponents in the labor movement 
                              disagreed with him not only on Zionist priorities, 
                              as Shlaim mentions, but also on what was realistic 
                              in the circumstances. They wished to postpone the 
                              explosion of the Arab-Jewish conflict for as long 
                              as possible. They believed that the sooner the 
                              Jewish-Arab conflict reached the flashpoint, the 
                              worse the Jewish prospects for victory; but the

                              time, "On the Iron Wall" was considered a little 
                              mad, and divorced from reality; but Shlaim 
                              believes that Jabotinsky's essay reads today like 
                              a very clear-eyed view of future Jewish-Arab 
                              relations. Contrary to what he claims, Jabotinsky 
                              and his ideas had only a marginal influence on the 
                              ideas of the political elite in the Yishuv 
                              generally, and on Ben-Gurion in particular. But 
                              Shlaim nonetheless seizes on the concept of the 
                              "iron wall" as an organizing paradigm to explain 
                              the evolution of the politics of the Yishuv and 
                              the state of Israel from the 1920s to the

                              achievement was to have foreseen that Arab 
                              acceptance of Jewish settlement in Palestine would 
                              come only after the Arabs were finally persuaded 
                              that they could never throw the Jews into the sea. 
                              Only then would they learn to speak about 
                              compromise; and the compromise, according to

                                Jabotinsky's strategy of the iron wall. The

                                compelled to negotiate with Israel from a 
                                position of palpable

                              size=3>Shlaim's appropriation of the "iron wall" 
                              as the controlling idea of his book is far from 
                              coincidental. It is an effort by a "new historian" 
                              to get a handle on the highly fluid situation 
                              before his eyes, in which the old categories and 
                              the old enmities are changing and receding. The 
                              notion of the "iron wall" denotes a realistic 
                              perspective, and presupposes that the changes in 
                              Israeli and Arab consciousness are largely a 
                              function of power relations; and such realism 
                              implies that the making of peace between Israel 
                              and its neighbors was not the result of Israeli 
                              breast-beating, but the outgrowth of a mutual 
                              recognition that peace is desirable. Yet Shlaim 
                              balks at a full acceptance of realism and its 
                              implications, as he must; for it is deeply at odds 
                              with his older, more tendentious thinking. Deep 
                              down, Shlaim really does believe that the Middle 
                              East is Arab turf, and that the Palestinians are 
                              innocent victims, and that the Israelis are 
                              outsiders and intruders. Thus his book is sorely 
                              weakened by a kind of historian's cognitive 
                              dissonance. His recognition of the realities on 
                              the ground flies in the face of his deepest 
                              feelings. As a result, his book is divided against 
                              itself.</FONT></P>

                              size=3>Shlaim's sentiments are revealed in his 
                              differing attitude toward Jews and Arabs. His 
                              approach to the latter is shaped by a kind of 
                              Realpolitik. After all, they are the indigenous 
                              inhabitants of the region; and so their actions 
                              require no justification, and are motivated by 
                              entirely understandable and self-evident 
                              interests. Yet Jews are repeatedly viewed through 
                              a moralistic prism: they are transgressors, and 
                              have come as invaders into the Arab East. Shlaim 
                              is prepared to accept the principle of national 
                              interest when it comes to the Arabs, but not when 
                              it comes to Israel. Israel's agreement with King 
                              Abdullah at the end of the war of 1948 is 
                              criticized for its instrumentality: "It was a 
                              striking example of the unsentimental Realpolitik 
                              approach that had dictated Israel's conduct 
                              throughout the first Arab-Israeli war." But Shlaim 
                              offers no criticism of Abdullah's takeover of the 
                              West Bank, or of Egypt's seizure of the Gaza Strip 
                              or of Syria's grab of territory west of the 
                              international frontier.</FONT></P>

                              same disparity obtains also for peace feelers. 
                              Shlaim assumes that it was legitimate for the 
                              Syrians and the Egyptians to demand from Israel 
                              half of the Sea of Galilee and portions of the 
                              Negev as the price for peace; but he deems 
                              Israel's refusal to agree to massive territorial 
                              concessions as sufficient reason to put the blame 
                              on the Jewish state for bungling the opportunities 
                              for peace. Shlaim is also sympathetic to Syrian 
                              views on the demilitarized zones along the Sea of 
                              Galilee. Even though this land was territory 
                              forcibly occupied by Syria in the War of 1948, 
                              Shlaim is vehement in castigating Israel for 
                              trying to extend its sovereignty over it. As a 
                              general principle, Shlaim rejects the right to 
                              seize land by force, when it is a question of 
                              Israel's territorial gains; but Syria's 
                              irredentism is different. Since the land that 
                              Syria seized was taken by a rightful Arab "owner," 
                              it should not be faulted. But all of Israel's 
                              territorial gains are illegitimate and have to be 
                              returned.</FONT></P>

                              Shlaim's book, Israel emerges as the neighborhood 
                              bully in the 1950s. The main villain is David 
                              Ben-Gurion, whose policy, in Shlaim's account, was 
                              essentially a harsh display of military muscle. 
                              The hero in the white hat, by contrast, was Moshe 
                              Sharett, the moderate foreign minister who is a 
                              darling of the "new historians." In truth, 
                              Sharett's perspective on the Israeli-Arab conflict 
                              did not differ in principle from Ben-Gurion's. He, 
                              too, did not believe in the prospects of peace in 
                              the foreseeable future. Yet he showed much greater 
                              respect for the United Nations, and he wanted 
                              Israel to avoid actions that would provoke 
                              international criticism. He also believed that 
                              Arab animosity could be diminished by Israel's 
                              refraining from aggressive military acts, hoping 
                              that eventually this would lead to a 
                              reconciliation.</FONT></P>

                              Middle East in the 1950s, however, Sharett's 
                              approach hardly had a chance, considering the 
                              balance of power. Even in Shlaim's morally rigged 
                              account, the real situation of Israel in the 1950s 
                              is detectable. Between Shlaim's lines one can 
                              recognize a weak state, lacking in 
                              self-confidence, isolated. It had no source for 
                              the weapons that were necessary for its defense 
                              against the Soviet arsenal that began to pour into 
                              Egypt from the mid-1950s. Shlaim himself notes 
                              that Sharett's efforts to procure weapons came to 
                              naught:</FONT></P>

                              that same period, the Western powers treated 
                              Israel like a poor relative whose land they were 
                              trying to sell behind her back. In his famous 
                              Guild Hall speech in 1955, the British prime 
                              minister Anthony Eden demanded that Israel 
                              relinquish territory in the Negev in order to 
                              facilitate a land bridge between Egypt and Jordan. 
                              John Foster Dulles, Eisenhower's secretary of 
                              state, entertained notions of finessing a peace 
                              deal between Israel and its neighbors, in which 
                              Israel would give up territory and agree to absorb 
                              100,000 Arab refugees as the price for peace. 
                              Shlaim views those demands, which were really 
                              designed to strip Israel of territory that was 
                              allotted it by the United Nations in the partition 
                              plan of 1947, as legitimate demands. He does not 
                              utter a word about the questionable morality of 
                              the attempt by the great powers to violate 
                              massively the territory of a small

                              recounts the Sinai Campaign as a grand conspiracy 
                              by Israel, France, and Britain. Israel is the main 
                              rogue in the cabal. And, as befits a moralistic 
                              tale, the bad guys lose. There is a pinch of 
                              malicious glee in Shlaim's account of the calamity 
                              of the belligerent Israelis, and of Ben-Gurion in 
                              particular, forced to climb down from the heights 
                              of victory to the pits of a forced pullback. 
                              Shlaim also tries his level best to prove that the 
                              Sinai war did not achieve its aims. He cannot deny 
                              that the Egyptian army was defeated, and the 
                              Straits of Tiran were opened, and the fedayeen 
                              bases in the Gaza Strip were destroyed. Still, he 
                              prefers to emphasize that Nasser was not removed 
                              from power, and Israel did not expand its 
                              territory, and a new order was not achieved in the 
                              Middle East. Shlaim makes no reference to the fact 
                              that in the wake of the Sinai Campaign, Israel 
                              enjoyed a decade of relative calm on the 
                              Israel-Egyptian frontier, and that the port of 
                              Eilat indeed remained open to international 
                              shipping, and that Israel's standing in the 
                              international arena was significantly enhanced. 
                              After 1956, schemes that resembled Eden's Guild 
                              Hall speech disappeared.</FONT></P>

                              was a stormy year in the Middle East. In Iraq, an 
                              army coup toppled the pro-Western government. In 
                              pro-Western Lebanon and Jordan, there were 
                              Nasserite attempts at subversion. President 
                              Eisenhower dispatched the Marines to Lebanon in 
                              order to forestall a possible collapse of 
                              pro-Western forces there. Israel was requested to 
                              allow British overflights for transporting troops 
                              to aid the Hashemite regime in Jordan. Shlaim 
                              takes a neutral stand when commenting on the 
                              subversive actions by pro-Nasserite forces. There 
                              are no "conspiracies" or "plots" here; he reserves 
                              those dark terms for the relations between Israel 
                              and King Abdullah, and for the Sinai Campaign. 
                              Nasser, after all, was an indigenous leader in the 
                              Arab East, and in Shlaim's eyes internecine Arab 
                              intrigue is not a fit subject for condemnation. 
                              Yet Shlaim is astounded that Israel should be so 
                              brazen as to even consider requesting recompense 
                              for having permitted Western powers to use its 
                              airspace: "Israel was not being asked to do 
                              anything to help Jordan, except to permit the use 
                              of its airspace. Nevertheless, Ben-Gurion 
                              earnestly hoped to get something in return for 
                              helping the Western powers."</FONT></P>

                              Americans and the British refused to bargain with 
                              Ben-Gurion about a military or political reward 
                              for his compliance with their requests. Yet when 
                              the Soviets threatened Israel for having opened 
                              its airspace to Western forces, and Ben-Gurion, 
                              deeply distressed, tried to cancel the permission 
                              for overflights, he was strongly rebuked by 
                              Dulles. The incident pointed up Israel's 
                              fundamental weakness, and its desperate search for 
                              allies against the threat posed by Nasser and 
                              Nasserism--and it pointed up also the exploitative 
                              attitude of the United States and Great Britain 
                              toward Israel at the time. In Shlaim's portrayal, 
                              however, Israel's positions are presented as 
                              demanding and immoderate. With another pinch of 
                              glee, he notes that Ben-Gurion's hopes for 
                              strategic cooperation with the West against the 
                              forces of radical Arab nationalism came to 
                              naught.</FONT></P>

                              not until 1964 that an Israeli prime minister was 
                              officially welcomed at the White House, when 
                              Lyndon Johnson received Levi Eshkol. In their 
                              joint statement at the conclusion of the visit, 
                              Johnson proclaimed the need to maintain the 
                              territorial integrity of all the states in the 
                              region. Shlaim remarks that this was the first 
                              time Washington abandoned the idea of changing the 
                              borders of the 1949 armistice line. Such a fact, 
                              you might think, casts a different light upon 
                              Israel's search during those years for allies and 
                              arms. If even a government as friendly to Israel 
                              as the government of the United States was not 
                              prepared during that perilous time to guarantee 
                              the 1949 borders (what today is called the "Green 
                              Line"), then Israel's situation was in truth 
                              fraught with great danger, and Ben-Gurion's 
                              obsession with Israel's fragility was not 
                              illusory.</FONT></P>

                              objectivity toward Arab actions and to point a 
                              scolding finger at Israel is also conspicuous in 
                              his account of the deterioration that led to the 
                              Six-Day War. Meeting in Cairo in 1964, the Arab 
                              League resolved to divert the waters of the Jordan 
                              River, which are vital for Israel's existence. At 
                              that same conference, there was a public 
                              declaration of the intention to destroy Israel, 
                              and the PLO was founded. Shlaim avoids any 
                              judgment of those bellicose moves against Israel's 
                              very existence: after all, one must not berate the 
                              virtuous Arab determination to extirpate the 
                              foreign body from their midst.</FONT></P>

                              size=3>Instead Shlaim dwells on the Israeli 
                              responses to the attempts to divert the Jordan 
                              River, responses that he deems disproportionate to 
                              the provocation. He blames the deterioration of 
                              the situation on those escalating Israeli 
                              responses--Israel used its air force to destroy 
                              the Syrian positions, and bombarded the Syrian 
                              water diversion project, after which the Syrians 
                              bombarded the kibbutzim along the Jordan--and on 
                              truculent statements by Chief of Staff Yitzhak 
                              Rabin and Prime Minister Levi Eshkol against the 
                              Baath regime in Damascus. Yet he fails to make any 
                              mention of the role played by Moscow in inciting 
                              Nasser to send his army into Sinai by supplying 
                              the disinformation that Israel was concentrating 
                              "huge armed forces" near the Syrian 
                              border.</FONT></P>

                              face="times, times new roman, serif" size=3>The 
                              Six-Day War is correctly portrayed by Shlaim as a 
                              defensive war; but he does not permit Israel to 
                              enjoy the laurels of a just victory for very long. 
                              From the outset, Shlaim is skeptical about 
                              Israel's readiness to relinquish land in return 
                              for peace. Thus, in his calendar of red-letter 
                              dates, he does not bother to note the Israeli 
                              government decision of June 19, 1967 declaring its 
                              willingness to pull back from conquered territory 
                              in return for peace. In marked contrast, Shlaim's 
                              presentation of the resolutions at the Arab summit 
                              conference at Khartoum in September, 1967--"no to 
                              recognition, no to negotiations, no to 
                              peace"--suggests that this thundering rejection 
                              actually disguised Nasser's readiness to reach a 
                              de facto agreement with Israel. Shlaim musters no 
                              real evidence for such a claim, aside from King 
                              Hussein's statement in his interview with Shlaim 
                              that Nasser had authorized him to seek a 
                              comprehensive peace; but the king's remark can be 
                              read differently--namely, that Nasser was 
                              cautioning Hussein in this way about daring to go 
                              it alone in attempting to conclude a separate 
                              peace with Israel. And even if we assume that 
                              Shlaim's reading of Hussein's remark is right, 
                              this is excellent evidence that nothing clears the 
                              mind like defeat: what Nasser was unprepared even 
                              to think about before the war, he was now ready to 
                              act on.</FONT></P>

                              relations passed through a dramatic 
                              transformation. The poor relative whom everyone 
                              wished to disclaim now became the recognized ally 
                              of Washington in the Middle East. Shlaim tells the 
                              story of this strategic transformation, but he 
                              does not ask the obvious question. What was the 
                              cause of this striking shift? How was it that 
                              Eisenhower and Dulles treated Israel with such 
                              contempt, while Nixon and Kissinger provided it 
                              with a huge arsenal and a deterrent against the 
                              Soviet Union, bolstered by financial aid, as did 
                              all the American presidents who followed? Was 
                              Israel led with greater wisdom in the 1970s and 
                              1980s than in the 1950s and 1960s?</FONT></P>

                              massive bombing in Egypt, the fumble of chances 
                              for reaching an interim agreement with Egypt in 
                              1971, the Yom Kippur War, the war in Lebanon: in 
                              all these episodes, Israel made mistakes and 
                              Israel botched opportunities. It proved fully as 
                              obstinate as in the 1950s, maybe more so. And yet, 
                              wondrously, those errors did not lead to a 
                              worsening of the conflict and to greater Israeli 
                              isolation, as might have been expected from 
                              Shlaim's moralistic interpretations.</FONT></P>

                              size=3>Indeed, the outcome was the opposite. 
                              Starting in the 1970s, and increasingly so after 
                              the Yom Kippur War in 1973, President Sadat of 
                              Egypt demonstrated it was possible to recognize 
                              the state of Israel, and to enter into direct 
                              negotiations with Israel, and even to discuss a 
                              final peace agreement with Israel. Shlaim had 
                              presented all those possibilities as 
                              impossibilities, as unshakable Arab taboos. Every 
                              time Israel came forward with such a condition, 
                              Shlaim depicted it as a mere tactic designed to 
                              blame the other side for the failure of 
                              negotiations. And then, all of a sudden, Israel 
                              and Egypt were prepared to act on what they had 
                              not even dreamed of a few short years before. The 
                              Israelis were ready to withdraw from all of Sinai, 
                              and the Egyptians were ready to reach a separate 
                              peace accord with Israel.</FONT></P>

                              does not ask how this extraordinary turn came 
                              about, because the answer is self-evident. The 
                              answer is that power did its sobering work, and 
                              realism came to be preferred to moralism. 
                              Initially, the military might that Israel 
                              demonstrated in the Six-Day War had opened 
                              Washington's eyes to the importance of this 
                              potential ally for stability in the Middle East, 
                              not least as a brake on Soviet influence in the 
                              region. After the Six-Day War, Israel became 
                              somewhat intoxicated with its own strength; but 
                              six years later the Yom Kippur War returned Israel 
                              to its senses, and put a stop to the triumphalist 
                              flights of fancy following the triumph of 1967. 
                              Concomitantly, the war in 1973 provided Sadat with 
                              the legitimacy to reach a separate peace with 
                              Israel, even as it demonstrated that Israel could 
                              not be coerced into an agreement. It seems that 
                              all sides involved in the Middle East conflict had 
                              recognized the validity of a realistic 
                              approach.</FONT></P>

                              realism of the "iron wall" also applied to the 
                              Palestinians. After all the terror acts 
                              perpetrated by Palestinian organizations in the 
                              1970s and '80s, which Shlaim skips over 
                              nonchalantly, the Intifada erupted in December 
                              1987. It demonstrated to Israelis and Palestinians 
                              alike that force was not the answer. The uprising 
                              led to a moderating of the PLO's hard-line 
                              positions: the Palestinians were now prepared to 
                              recognize Israel's right to exist and even to 
                              accept the U.N. decision of 1947 on partition--to 
                              accept the principle of two states and thus to 
                              renounce terror. Once again, then, what Shlaim 
                              believed was non-negotiable for the Palestinians 
                              became negotiable. It took four decades, to be 
                              sure; but four decades is not an unreasonably long 
                              time in the context of ethnic and religious and 
                              national conflicts.</FONT></P>

                              ideological judgment and Realpolitik is manifest 
                              also in his account of the Gulf War. Israel acted 
                              with admirable restraint in that war, in not 
                              responding to the Scud attacks by Saddam Hussein. 
                              We would have expected Shlaim to give Israel a 
                              medal for good conduct. Instead he instructs that 
                              Israel's failure to act dented its reputation as a 
                              military great power in the eyes of its 
                              adversaries! In the event, Shlaim further 
                              observes, the United States shifted closer to the 
                              Arab states. When Israel pursues the moderate 
                              policies lauded by Shlaim, it forfeits its 
                              deterrent ability and its status as Washington's 
                              main ally in the region; and when it acts 
                              immoderately, it is simply villainous. Israel is 
                              damned if it does and damned if it 
                              doesn't.</FONT></P>

                              infuses his account of the man and his politics 
                              with a diabolical dimension. As a rule, the "new

                              the figure of Ben-Gurion. He is identified more

                              strong personality, a leader not afraid to defy 
                              the entire world. I would even conjecture that he 
                              regarded his image as one of the weapons in 
                              Israel's deterrent arsenal. But the truth about 
                              Ben-Gurion was more complicated and more humane. 
                              Behind the bravura was a man who feared for the 
                              fate of the young state. Not everything that 
                              Ben-Gurion did or said was worthy of praise; he 
                              sometimes made mistakes and he sometimes talked 
                              folly. But ultimately he was the man of the status 
                              quo of 1949, not the pugnacious ruffian of 
                              territorial conquest that Shlaim

                              to Jabotinsky--that the Arabs would try again and 
                              again to destroy Israel, until they finally 
                              despaired of a military solution and came to terms 
                              with Israel's existence. (The Revisionists were

                              power.) In the meantime, Israel had to remain 
                              strong, and build a solid and stable society, and 
                              grow demographically, and seek out allies among

                              A long process of persuasion was necessary before

                              Campaign, and even then he agreed to act only 
                              after he had been promised air cover by the 
                              French. He feared Soviet involvement, and 
                              Bulganin's threat in 1956 to dispatch "volunteers" 
                              to the Middle East was reason enough to order a 
                              pullback from the Sinai Peninsula. If ever 
                              Ben-Gurion entertained dreams of territorial 
                              expansion, they dissolved with the withdrawal from

                              Rabin was rebuked for having placed Israel in

                              Egypt. After the war, he declared that all the

                              Jabotinsky and Begin. Jabotinsky is presented as 
                              Ben-Gurion's veritable mentor and guide, which is 
                              a truly bizarre notion. Shlaim even has Jabotinsky 
                              exerting an influence on Rabin, though there is no 
                              doubt Rabin never read a page that Jabotinsky 
                              wrote. It is true that Jabotinsky was a liberal, 
                              and ready to guarantee the Arabs minority rights 
                              within the Jewish state; but in this respect he 
                              was no different from the other Zionist leaders. 
                              All of them, Ben-Gurion included, spoke in the

                              Israel with cynical skepticism, he musters 
                              profound understanding for Begin's fears. Shlaim 
                              argues that the bombing of the Iraqi nuclear 
                              reactor in 1982 was not carried out for electoral 
                              reasons; the timing of the Israeli action, he 
                              explains, was owed to Begin's genuine anxiety 
                              about Israel's future, to fears rooted in his own 
                              experience in the Holocaust. Shlaim accepts 
                              uncritically and at face value Begin's flagrant 
                              appropriation of images of the Shoah in the war in 
                              Lebanon; it is only on rare occasions that Shlaim 
                              criticizes Begin for exploiting the great Jewish 
                              tragedy for political gain. And many Israelis 
                              would be astounded to read about "Begin's

                              right to the Israeli left. After all, Jabotinsky 
                              looked the Arab problem straight in the eye, 
                              without flinching, and acknowledged the national 
                              character of the Arabs, and even sketched a model 
                              that would grant Arabs future rights. But the 
                              Israeli left (which includes Labor Zionism) is, in 
                              Shlaim's eyes, hypocritical and inauthentic, with 
                              all its moral perplexity and its overblown 
                              sensitivity, aspiring to a brand of Zionism with 
                              humanistic and socialist elements, and attempting 
                              to dodge the problem as long as it was not acute. 
                              For Shlaim, this camp, which founded the state, is 
                              ultimately responsible for the tragedy of the 
                              Palestinians.

                              scenario: first there would be conflict, when the 
                              Jews would curb and beat down the Arabs by 
                              military might, and then there would be

                              have the same answers to this question. For the

                              guaranteed over the entirety of the Land of 
                              Israel, over Greater Israel. (<EM>That</EM> is how

                              peace will come when the Palestinians are prepared 
                              to assent to the principle of partition and to 
                              recognize the right of the existence of two 
                              peoples in the land west of the Jordan. For this 
                              reason, it is the heirs of the pragmatic tradition 
                              of Ben-Gurion and Weizmann--and not the heirs of 
                              the inflexible tradition of Jabotinsky--who are

                              itself, well, he himself states that there was a

                              notes elsewhere that the Arabs forced it upon 
                              Israel. If he is alluding to the fact that the 
                              Arab Palestinians did not establish a state in 
                              1948, because they were stymied by Israel, surely 
                              he should place the blame for that first and 
                              foremost on the Palestinians themselves, and on 
                              their Arab brethren. Or was Israel supposed to 
                              take the initiative in creating a Palestinian

                              Morris ironically alluding to the tendency of both

                              adversary, as Morris himself says in one of his 
                              more incisive passages? Or are both sides right, 
                              and victims of the historical situation or their 
                              own nationalist aspirations? Morris does not

                              attempt at conceptualization. His method is a sort 
                              of muddling through. In every chapter he presents 
                              the culprits and the casualties of the given 
                              moment. In most instances, the result is quite 
                              balanced. Thus, while Shlaim accuses Israel of 
                              consciously renouncing the various chances for 
                              peace after 1949, Morris contends that leaders on 
                              both sides failed to utilize the opportunities 
                              that presented themselves. Regarding infiltration 
                              in the 1950s, Shlaim claims that Arab countries 
                              did everything possible to curb the infiltrators; 
                              and he relies, for proof, only on King Hussein's 
                              comment in his interview with him: "We had done 
                              everything that we could to prevent infiltration 
                              and to prevent access to Israel." Surely a 
                              historian is obliged to find better evidence for 
                              his findings than the word of a king. Morris, by 
                              contrast, blames the Arab regimes for some of the 
                              infiltration activity, especially in the Gaza 
                              Strip, noting that Israeli reprisals induced the 
                              Egyptians and the Jordanians to take measures to 
                              stem infiltration.</FONT></P>

                              innocent Arabs, Shlaim avoids any mention of Arab 
                              atrocities against Jews. Morris, on the other 
                              hand, points to a number of cases of murder and 
                              violence perpetrated by Arab infiltrators and 
                              fedayeen in the 1950s, and even devotes an entire

                              nationalism. In his view, Nasser was not a hero 
                              but a dictator leading his people astray. For this 
                              reason, his account of the Sinai Campaign lacks 
                              Shlaim's moral fervor. Morris takes Nasser's

                              national hysteria that engulfed the Arab states, 
                              articulated in calls for Israel's destruction. 
                              Shlaim passes over the frenzy in silence. After 
                              the war, moreover, Morris does not flow with 
                              compassion for Nasser; he views him as a scoundrel 
                              and a failed tyrant. Morris's account of Israeli 
                              rule in the occupied territories is detailed and 
                              critical, and he does not conceal from the reader 
                              distressing events that illustrate the invidious

                              topic of "transfer." The notion of "transfer" was 
                              commonly accepted in the period between the two 
                              world wars to designate population exchanges such

                              1920s. "Transfer" became a code word in 
                              contemporary Israeli politics after the emergence 
                              of the far right radical party Moledet (Homeland) 
                              in the 1980s, led by Rehavam Zeevi. Moledet 
                              advanced the idea of transfer, or the removal of 
                              the Palestinians from the West Bank, as part of 
                              its party platform; and in order to gain 
                              legitimacy for himself and his party, Zeevi 
                              declared that he was following in the footsteps of 
                              the founders of the labor movement from its very 
                              inception, that "transfer" was vintage Zionist

                              Zionism's founding fathers is a hallmark of the 
                              politics of the Israeli right: thus the members of 
                              Gush Emunim (Bloc of the Faithful) present 
                              themselves as the rightful heirs to the pioneer 
                              heritage in the pre-state period. Zeevi seized on 
                              statements on transfer from the 1930s, articulated 
                              in substantially different circumstances, in order

                              ideas were sympathetically received in the ranks 
                              of the right. The "new historians" are intent on 
                              demonstrating that there was never a golden age of 
                              simplicity and innocence in the Zionist movement, 
                              and that its founders were full of guilt and guile 
                              from the start; and those on the right are keen to 
                              show that what is repudiated today as immoral was 
                              not an idea that they invented, but rather a part 
                              of the Zionist heritage. In both cases, the result 
                              is the libeling of Zionism and the undermining of

                                that characterized the first Arab-Israeli war; 
                                in smaller part, it was the deliberate creation

                              the evidence. But Morris was attacked by Arab 
                              historians, notably Nur Masalha, and even by his 
                              colleagues Avi Shlaim and Ilan Pappe, who argued

                              criticisms, Morris undertook a partial revision of 
                              his findings. What in his earlier book was an ugly

                                before 1937, was one of the main currents in 
                                Zionist ideology from the movement's

                              the idea of transfer attended Zionism from its 
                              inception, so did Arab fears of precisely such a 
                              scheme. The inference from this line of reasoning 
                              is that the Arabs resisted Jewish settlement not 
                              because they regarded themselves as Palestine's 
                              rightful owners and did not wish to share the land 
                              with a people whom they perceived as a foreign 
                              invader; nor because they were opposed to 
                              transforming Palestine from a land with a 
                              predominantly Muslim culture into a non-Muslim 
                              country steeped in Western culture. No, their 
                              motive was well-founded fear: they <EM>knew</EM> 
                              that the Jews intended in due time to expel them. 
                              As Morris writes, "the fear of territorial 
                              displacement and dispossession was to be the chief 
                              motor of Arab antagonism to Zionism down to 1948 
                              (and indeed after 1967 as well)." In this way 
                              history is spun on its head, and the effect is 
                              made into the cause, and the result of war is 
                              promoted into the paradigm for the entire complex 
                              of relations between Arabs and Jews over several 
                              decades.</FONT></P>

                              materialize by means of massive Jewish 
                              immigration. It should not be forgotten that in 
                              1920 the Arab population of Palestine numbered 
                              only some 600,000. The Zionist premise--which 
                              history has proven right--was that there was land 
                              aplenty in western Palestine for millions of Jews 
                              and Arabs. All the Zionist plans at the end of the 
                              1930s envisioned the influx of a million Jews to 
                              Palestine within a decade. That magical number was 
                              geared to guaranteeing a Jewish majority, which is 
                              why the Arabs were so hostile to immigration: not 
                              because they were afraid of expulsion, but because 
                              they wished to prevent a demographic

                              idea of transfer was broached in serious 
                              discussion for the first time in 1937, when the 
                              Peel Commission proposed to transfer the large 
                              Arab minority from the territory designated for 
                              the tiny Jewish state as part of the package deal 
                              that envisioned a partitioning of western 
                              Palestine into two states, Jewish and Arab. In 
                              accordance with the Commission's proposals, the 
                              British were to carry out the transfer. Morris 
                              declares that "it is reasonable to assume that the 
                              Zionist leaders played a role in persuading the 
                              Peel Commission to adopt the transfer solution." 
                              There is not even a sliver of evidence to support 
                              such a claim, which is very far removed from what 
                              any credible historian may reasonably assume. It 
                              is perfectly legitimate for Morris to surmise that 
                              the Zionists did not lament the Peel Commission 
                              proposal, and even rejoiced at it. But such 
                              gladness is a long way from the unsubstantiated 
                              presumption that they were implicated in its 
                              formulation.</FONT></P>

                              also true that Ben-Gurion and his associates 
                              welcomed the British idea to transfer Arabs from 
                              the small area set aside for the Jewish state. In 
                              Ben-Gurion's efforts at the Twentieth Zionist 
                              Congress in 1937 to drum up support for adoption 
                              of the partition plan, he made use of the concept 
                              of transfer in order to persuade his comrades to 
                              accept the tiny state proposed by the Commission, 
                              since the Jews would be a large majority there. 
                              The idea of transfer was a lure designed to 
                              convince Zionists to swallow the bitter pill of 
                              partition. In later years, Ben-Gurion warned of 
                              the dangers inherent in embracing the idea of 
                              transfer as a Zionist program, even after the 
                              British Labour Party had chosen to incorporate it 
                              in its platform.</FONT></P>

                              did not permit Jewish immigration, most certainly 
                              would not have endorsed any plan of Arab transfer. 
                              If we are speaking about a future with Palestine 
                              under Jewish rule, then the Jewish authorities 
                              would have been able to bring in millions of Jews

                              expulsion. What had fueled a massive wish to leave 
                              Europe was the calamitous situation of the Jews

                              there is not a shred of evidence that Zionist

                              evidence that the transfer idea supplanted the 
                              idea of immigration as a means to achieve a Jewish 
                              majority in Palestine. But still Morris claims 
                              that, starting with the Peel Commission, the idea 
                              of transfer enjoyed a general consensus in 
                              virtually all the Zionist bodies. His book lacks 
                              any notes indicating which deliberations (and how 
                              many deliberations) he is referring to, and it is 
                              thus impossible to determine whether the sources

                              transfer within the context of the discussions on 
                              partition in 1937 with the creation of the refugee 
                              problem in 1948: "The idea was in the air from 
                              1937 onward and without doubt contributed in 
                              various ways to the transfer that eventually took

                              of such a master plan, but never mind. The idea,

                              born as a consequence of Arab resistance to the 
                              settlement of a foreign element in their land. The

                              Palestine and were unwilling to enter into any

                              to war in 1948 because they were afraid the Jews 
                              would oust them; they went to war because they 
                              were not prepared to make their peace with the 
                              idea of a Jewish state in Palestine.</FONT></P>

                              intended to do with the Jews in Palestine after a

                              both sides, Arab and Jewish, there was a composite 
                              of flight and expulsion. Jews fled in fear from 
                              mixed neighborhoods such as the border areas 
                              between Jaffa and Tel Aviv, and even from Jaffa 
                              itself. There were some 10,000 Jewish refugees in 
                              the early stages of the war. Gush Etzion, on the 
                              road between Bethlehem and Hebron, was captured by 
                              the Arab Legion and local Palestinian forces: the 
                              inhabitants were killed or taken prisoner and 
                              carried across the Jordan. Their settlements were 
                              completely demolished. The settlements Neveh 
                              Ya'akov and Atarot north of Jerusalem, also 
                              captured, were totally obliterated. All the 
                              residents of the Jewish quarter in the Old City in 
                              Jerusalem, conquered by local forces with the aid 
                              of the Arab Legion, were taken captive. No Jew was 
                              allowed to return to settle in the Old City--not 
                              even the ultra-Orthodox who detested Zionism and 
                              were prepared to live under Arab rule.</FONT></P>

                              The Jews were convinced that the Arabs were going
