      civilizations fall? Islamic thinkers had an image for it. Consider a 
      civilization based upon a court in a thriving city— Baghdad, for example. 
      Arts and the intellect flourish. But over several generations, as the 
      great Islamic philosopher of the fourteenth century Ibn Khaldun put it, 
      the civilized become decadent with luxury. They lose their sharpness and 
      think only of the good and the beautiful. And then some tribe of fierce 
      Bedouin, smelling out weakness, come thundering in from the desert and 
      storm the city. As barbarians, they do not understand the usages of 
      civilization. They stable their horses in the libraries and use sculptures 
      as doorstops, pictures for target practice. Given a pillow, Ibn Khaldun 
      tells us contemptuously, they suppose it to be a bundle of rags. In time, 
      however, the power of a superior culture is felt, and these people adopt 
      and sometimes extend the ways of civilization, until they too are 
      overthrown in their turn. 
      <P class=ind>This is the way the world goes. Sometimes it happens in one 
      lifetime, as with those barbarian soldiers who rose to become Roman 
      emperors, sometimes in slow motion, as with the fall of the Roman Empire, 
      in which many centuries were to elapse before the new civilization emerged 
      from the disorders of the barbarian invasions. With us, the decor is quite 
      different, but the realities may be closer than we suppose. 
      <P class=ind>One reason we may not realize this is that the very 
      distinction between barbarism and civilization has been suppressed by the 
      current relativism, which asserts the equality of all cultures. Nobody, of 
      course, seriously believes this. Quite apart from technology, the moral 
      inequality of cultures is conspicuous in the position of women in 
      different cultures. It was only the West that abolished slavery. But it is 
      a mark of current decorum—perhaps avoidance of the dreaded 
      “triumphalism”—that we should not proclaim any superiority in European 
      civilization, even though it is the one place the millions want to get 
      into. Instead, we must make do with a rationalist doctrine which 
      transposes the usages of European civilization into a rather 
      unsatisfactory set of abstractions about universal rights. By this device, 
      all cultures (including the Western) can equally be found guilty of moral 
      violation in one way or another. 
      <P class=ind>In the past, civilization was a sensibility shared by a class 
      of people, while barbarism would be found not only in tribes beyond the 
      frontier, but also in the slaves and the servile within the realms of 
      civilization itself. In modern liberal democracies, this clear relation 
      between a culture and a class has disappeared. Everyone is touched by the 
      higher forms of culture. Schooling, museums, and the media are available 
      to all. But barbarism remains an active force in modern societies, partly 
      in gracelessness and ignorance, and partly in a loss of cultural coherence 
      found among those who mistake a few years at an institution of higher 
      learning for education itself. 
      <P class=ind>In modern Europe, we don’t quite have Bedouin storming in 
      from the desert (merely millions of depressed migrants trying to slip 
      through the gates), but the tendency towards barbarism is an active force 
      all around us. Hence the formula for overthrowing a Western society must 
      be not “storm the walls” but “organize your own barbarians” within the 
      walls. Those who hate European civilization know that it cannot be taken 
      by direct assault. It must thus be captured from within. This was the plan 
      adopted by many revolutionaries, most notably, of course, by Marx who 
      constructed a new and hostile tribe within the West called “the 
      proletariat.” They could be made into a revolutionary tribe by equipping 
      suitable people (industrial workers for example) with a unified 
      consciousness, so that in every transaction they understood themselves as 
      a collective. They were being victimized by the oppressive bourgeois. Like 
      the guardians in Plato’s Republic, these revolutionary insurgents had to 
      be taught to be docile within the movement while snarling at those 
      without. 
      <P class=ind>Marx provided the model for all subsequent movements aiming 
      to take power. His “make your own tribe” kit was found useful by 
      nationalists, anarchists, and many brands of socialist. Hitler made the 
      most creative use of it by playing down victimization and representing 
      every Aryan as a superior type of person. It took the world in arms to get 
      rid of him. But before long, revolutionaries discovered that a revolution 
      based on the proletarian tribe only really worked if you were dealing with 
      pretty unsophisticated peoples—preferably non-Europeans who lacked all 
      experience of freedom and genuine political life. In socially mobile 
      European states, the workers mostly found better things to do with their 
      time than waste it on revolutionary committees and the baby talk of 
      political demonstrations. Something new was needed. 
      <P class=ind>It was provided by such socialists as Mussolini and Lenin who 
      adopted the principle of the Praetorian Guard: a tightly knit vanguard 
      party, which could use the masses as ventriloquial dummies and seek power 
      on its own terms. This development was part of a wider tendency towards 
      the emergence of oligarchies ruling through democratic slogans. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>I</FONT>n the course of the 1960s, a new tribe was 
      established that also sought to overthrow the Western citadel from within 
      and had notably greater success. This was Betty Friedan’s radical 
      feminists. It was a tribe constructed out of women who had taken some sort 
      of degree and were living domestic lives. Technology had largely liberated 
      them from the rigors of beating, sweeping, and cleaning, while 
      pharmacology had released them from excessive procreation. In tactical 
      terms, radical feminists made one innovation that has turned out to be 
      crucial to the destiny of the West over the last half century. They 
      suppressed almost completely the idea that their project involved a 
      transfer of power and operated entirely on the moralistic principle that 
      their demands corresponded to justice. 
      <P class=ind>What lay behind this momentous development? It is a 
      complicated question, but I think that Diana Schaub understood the essence 
      of it in her essay “On the Character of Generation <FONT 
      size=-1>X</FONT>”: <A name=back1></A><A 
      href="http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/19/apr01/minogue.htm#fn1">[1]</A> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE class=qb>[Betty] Friedan was right that the malaise these 
        privileged women were experiencing was a result of “a slow death of the 
        mind and spirit.” But she was wrong in saying that the problem had no 
        name—its name was boredom. Feminism was born of boredom, not oppression. 
        And what was the solution to this quandary? Feminists clamored to become 
        wage-slaves; they resolutely fled the challenge of leisure. 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>And by “leisure,” Professor Schaub means something 
      classically Greek: the higher employment of the mind once the necessities 
      of life have been dealt with. 
      <P class=ind>The first task of this new movement was to create the shared 
      consciousness necessary for tribal functioning. Like all forms of psychic 
      collectivism, “consciousness raising” (as it is known) exploits 
      indignation and cultivates righteousness. It operated in this case with 
      the basic liberatory image of the prison and, identifying happiness with 
      being in the labor force, argued that only male oppression over the 
      centuries had “confined” women to the domestic sphere. What radical 
      feminism essentially did was to deny complementarity between the sexes and 
      set men and women up as competing teams playing exactly the same game, but 
      a game in which all the rules were stacked against the women. It was only 
      on this eccentric assumption—i.e., that women had identical talents and 
      inclinations to men—that they could support the conclusion that there had 
      been foul play. As with Hitler’s appeal to the Aryan race, the basic 
      principle was one of flattery: women, it revealed, are a marvelously 
      talented set of people who have been iniquitously suppressed by males 
      running a patriarchal system. 
      <P class=ind>This message entrenched identity politics, an emerging form 
      of fundamentalism in which every judgment must begin from a supposedly 
      essential self-identity as female. One implication (as with Marxism) was 
      that a class of experts understood social reality better than any 
      particular woman could, and any woman failing to agree needed the falsity 
      of her consciousness corrected. Joined together, these judgments 
      constituted the new doctrine now simply called “feminism.” This was a 
      massive psychic transformation in the life of European peoples. Back in 
      the Second World War, Rosie the riveter was certainly a woman, but she was 
      also a wife, a patriotic American involved in a struggle against fascism, 
      and many other things besides. Most fundamentally of all, radical feminism 
      attacked the very conception of the feminine as something that had been 
      imposed upon women by superior force and had been reinforced by a culture 
      of romance found in European art and literature. 
      <P class=ind>All of this might be construed (as it was by radical 
      feminists themselves) as a massive access of confidence among women, but 
      it might also signify a complete collapse of the feminine in the face of a 
      wider and more ambiguous project using women to create a totally 
      androgynous (and manipulable) world. In such a world, men and women would 
      become virtually indistinguishable. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>H</FONT>ere then was nothing less than an attempt to 
      destroy not merely an existing structure of power, but also the 
      civilization that it sustained. In Ibn Khaldun’s terms, it was an attempt 
      to conquer the West from within, not by directly attacking its power (for 
      no one doubted that the men had all the power needed to repel such an 
      attack), but by exploiting certain features in its culture. And in order 
      to understand the significance of this movement, we need to characterize 
      the European civilization that was the object of their attack. 
      <P class=ind>The most obvious fact about it is one that we can hardly 
      mention, now that the revolution has succeeded, without embarrassment or 
      derision, because it is a fact which powerful contemporary forces make 
      recessive. It is simply that this civilization is, in the crude terms of 
      creative hits, the achievement of white males. The history of Western 
      civilization is a succession of clever men developing the set of 
      traditions or inventing the benefits which, intertwined, constitute the 
      West. And from Thales and Euclid to Einstein and George Gershwin, nearly 
      all of them were male. They constitute the set of “dead white males” whom 
      the radical revolutionaries in the sub-academic culture have denigrated 
      and vowed to remove from their pedestals. I once heard a feminist put it 
      this way: “There’s no such thing as a great mind.” This doctrine is so 
      powerful that the simple factual statement that it has been men who have 
      created what is commonly meant by Western (and for that matter, any other) 
      civilization seems like an insensitive affront to the equality of mankind. 
      And the next step in my argument must be to deal with this as a problem. 
      <P class=ind>To say that men created all these things is true, and 
      significant, but it is rather like stranding a lot of fish on a barren 
      shore. It leaves out the medium of social and political life without which 
      none of this could have happened. Like all social life, Europe was a world 
      of sexual complementarity, and there is no reliable way of sifting out 
      what was contributory from what was not. But of women we may say what 
      Falstaff said of himself—namely that he not only had wit but also was a 
      cause of wit in others. But by seeming to set women up as a weak team in 
      relation to inventive men, I am merely pointing to the mistake radical 
      feminists, who have accepted the abstract idea that the one thing that 
      counts is who invented this or created that, themselves make. It is in 
      pursuit of this mistake that they have attempted to set up a competing 
      canon of writers, philosophers, painters, and so on whose talents were 
      suppressed by the patriarchy. These resuscitated figures are often worth 
      looking at in their own terms, but they cannot serve as a new canon. 
      Camille Paglia famously said that if we had waited for women to invent 
      civilization we should still be living in grass huts. It is also true that 
      if we had waited for men to make life comfortable we should still be 
      living in pigsties. For centuries women have determined the way we live. 
      Radical feminist doctrine is that this is not enough: women can only be 
      recognized as equal, and enjoy equality of esteem with men, if they are 
      recognized as excelling in exactly the same activities as men. Women must, 
      as a team, be able to point to a scoreboard of artistic and technological 
      achievements on the same scale as men. Feminist tribal consciousness 
      depends upon absorbing this and similar beliefs. But the whole rigmarole 
      depends upon assuming that women are the same as men, that their happiness 
      is found in exactly the same areas as that of men. But this is quite 
      untrue, and it is a mistake that could only have occurred to a set of 
      women whose minds had been deranged by a superficial contact with 
      education in the humanities. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he point can be put another way: Western 
      civilization is distinguished by an unusual curiosity about both nature 
      and the lives of other societies. Europeans have appropriated many of 
      their ideas and inventions from other civilizations. Partly for this 
      reason, it has been extraordinarily open to others who wish to engage in 
      its activities. Its religion, its languages, and its knowledge have been 
      widely diffused, and by the twentieth century people from all over the 
      world had become scientists, historians, novelists, artists, etc., in the 
      Western manner, many of them indeed coming to live in the West. Some 
      people from customary societies abroad have found Westerners cold and 
      remote, but many more have experienced the West as a liberation. 
      <P class=ind>The same is true for women. At various times in the past many 
      women have had access to education, and, from the eighteenth century 
      onwards, some women developed an increasing taste for taking up 
      professions previously restricted to men. By the late nineteenth century 
      they were making their way into universities. In doing so, they often 
      suffered a certain derision from the more brutish among their male 
      <I>confrères</I>. Other men were always on their side, however, and during 
      the first half of the twentieth century women broke into many fields 
      previously restricted by convention. Radical feminism as a tribal 
      consciousness needs to tell this story as a struggle against oppression, 
      and so in some ways it was. But we ought not to get this out of 
      proportion. We are not talking of slavery or war. 
      <P class=ind>The beneficiaries of this new development were for the most 
      part middle-class white women, and they were merely experiencing the 
      resistance common to any form of upward mobility. They were unmistakably 
      following a rising wave created by the increasing flexibility of Western 
      societies. It was in any case a Christian civilization, which meant that 
      individual character counted as much as customary status. In most 
      civilizations, human beings fit into a customary schema as warriors, 
      wives, priests, scholars, artisans, merchants, and so on. The West became, 
      as Ernest Gellner used to put it, “modular” in that individuals have 
      multiple talents and skills and can fit together with others in flexible 
      ways responding to new situations. Like furniture that can be rearranged 
      at need, Europeans have the versatility to fit into many possible 
      arrangements of work or pleasure. As women began to develop a taste for 
      education and had opportunities to participate in a world beyond the 
      domestic (previously available only to the rich), they soon succeeded (as 
      they usually do) in getting what they wanted. Liberal feminism was thus a 
      natural development from within the civilization. Suddenly in the 1960s, 
      this development was overridden by the new radical doctrine that women 
      could and should do everything men did. Liberal feminism emerged from the 
      Western tradition, and traditions are flexible. It had no problem in 
      admitting women to new professions without dramatically altering the wider 
      relations between the sexes. But, radical feminism was doctrinaire and 
      demanded that all women should live in the one true manner. A melodrama of 
      oppression was needed to fire up the new tribe. Just as Buddhist priests 
      must meditate on a human skull so that they will develop the right 
      consciousness of human mortality, so feminist doctrine thrives on horror 
      stories of women not allowed to take degrees at Oxbridge until this 
      century. By contrast with the horrors of the twentieth century (or indeed 
      the situation of women elsewhere in the world), we may diagnose a certain 
      lack of proportion. 
      <P class=ind>The openness of Western cultures is shown by the way in 
      which, during the first half of the twentieth century, Western women were 
      enjoying higher education and finding distinction in professional and 
      academic fields. The numbers of women who largely devoted their lives to 
      these fields was relatively small, and some people thought this was a 
      problem, but it was only a problem for those who took their bearings from 
      statistics rather than from the responses of actual people. The false 
      assumption of male and female isomorphism is, however, the reason why at 
      frequent intervals feminists in journalism become lobbyists and set up, as 
      a defect in society, any difference in average wages between men and women 
      or in the relative percentages of women in top jobs. This was the 
      continual drip of the movement against patriarchy, and it is a well-known 
      principle of propaganda that a proposition repeated enough will crush 
      opposition. But these figures and this argument make no rational sense, 
      and the fact that they appear regularly in newspapers as if they did make 
      sense is why they must be challenged. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he key to modern Western civilization is its 
      openness to talent wherever found. The feminist demand for collective 
      quotas has overturned this basic feature of our civilization. The crucial 
      point is that the character of a civilization is revealed by its 
      understanding of achievement. European civilization responded to 
      achievement wherever it could be found. To replace achievement by quota 
      entitlements is to destroy one civilization from within and to replace it 
      with another. We are no longer what we were. The problem is to explain how 
      the West collapsed. 
      <P class=ind>It did not result from warriors storming the walls of a 
      decadent civilization, but by a fifth column exploiting weakness from 
      within. And the weapon of attack was not the sword, but a moral rhetoric 
      demanding justice. Economic and political implications (such as that able 
      men would be denied jobs now having to be filled by quota) seldom featured 
      in discussion. The defenders of the status quo found themselves profoundly 
      confused, partly because they had earlier acquiesced in regarding moral 
      and religious ideas as merely subjective. They could not agree on a line 
      of defense, and the attack often came from within their own families. The 
      objective of the attack was to get women with degrees into the higher 
      ranks of the labor force. Of the more profound implications of this 
      structural collapse, I am are not here concerned. I must concentrate on 
      the more pressing question of why the defenders so easily capitulated. 
      <P class=ind>In earlier centuries, the project of getting women into the 
      labor force would have been visionary, partly no doubt because no one 
      thought in terms of a labor force. For one thing, women were necessary to 
      keep the home fires burning. In any case, the world of work outside the 
      hearth was hardly inviting. Ploughing the land required relentless 
      physical input beyond the strength of most women; nor were they keen to 
      exercise the broadsword. And, during a longish stretch of life, women 
      would have their hands full with bearing and nurturing children. 
      <P class=ind>In the modern world, however, getting women out of the home 
      and into work was not at all visionary, since the thing called “work” was 
      now largely done in centrally heated offices in front of a computer. In 
      the push-button world men had created, physical strength was hardly ever 
      needed, especially in the more attractive jobs. Work had been the curse of 
      Adam, parallel with childbirth as the curse of Eve, but work now turned 
      out to be a rather agreeable shuffling of symbols in an office full of 
      friendship and event. It was not difficult to present this kind of 
      work—the kind that interested the humanities graduates who largely fuelled 
      the radical movement—as a liberation from the confinement of family life 
      and the tedious babble of the toddler. And it fitted into a wider 
      socialist notion that a person’s value was the contribution made to the 
      welfare of others. It had been an old dream of Zionist socialists and 
      Bolsheviks (among others) to absorb the family into society with everyone 
      living communally, restaurants and daycare centers replacing family 
      arrangements, and women working each day alongside the men. Here this 
      dream was reborn, no longer as an aspect of utopia, but as the final 
      achievement of justice against an oppressive world. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>L</FONT>et us now turn to the nub of this question: why 
      did the insurrection succeed? There was no question of the insurgents 
      disposing of superior firepower or warrior virtues, though the tribe of 
      radical feminists certainly displayed intrepidity of the first order. 
      Indeed, the key point is that it was their very weakness that was the 
      condition of their success. Even the fact that, intellectually speaking, 
      radical feminism had nothing to say that had not been said by earlier 
      forms of social perfectionism merely meant that the opposition had already 
      been softened up for victimological attack. And for all the indignation 
      about oppression, radical feminists were less a moral force than a naked 
      interest, demanding jobs for their members, jobs carrying the same 
      salaries and status as men. It was even commonly admitted that outstanding 
      women had not in recent times had much trouble making their way in the 
      academic and workaday world. The issue was to get women of merely average 
      abilities into these positions. 
      <P class=ind>In principle, the men held all the cards. They were the 
      managers, the rulers, the professors, and the directors of enterprises. 
      And they were the trustees of the one thing on which their civilization 
      depended: namely, the career open to talent. No doubt there were times 
      where prejudice prevented women from getting such and such a job, but 
      hiring able women was something managers had long been doing. For in the 
      early twentieth century, women resembled Jews: some people might not want 
      to hire them but the failure to recognize ability would soon be punished 
      by competitors stealing an advantage. These considerations soon ceased to 
      apply once radical feminism has established the basic idea (always denied) 
      that the program was to establish a 50 percent quota for women in all 
      desirable jobs. 
      <P class=ind>We may understand what happened by considering a similar 
      assault on tradition mounted about the same time as the radical feminist 
      challenge. In the 1960s the universities of the Western world were shaken 
      by enemies who turned academic self-understanding against itself. 
      Universities were commonly recognized as communities of scholars and 
      students. “Well,” said the radicals, “if it’s a community, why are we 
      students left out in the cold, with no power on university committees? Why 
      are we not consulted about the content of our curricula? Why are we 
      subject to god-professors imposing on us courses of study irrelevant to 
      our needs?” Dazed and confused by these questions, which were often 
      expressed (as is the technique) with almost samurai displays of fearsome 
      aggression, the dons yielded. They betrayed their trust in the scholarly 
      vocation partly from confusion and partly in order to avoid 
      unpleasantness. 
      <P class=ind>This example not only illuminates the success of radical 
      feminism, but also reveals something of the long-term significance of 
      these massive shifts of power. For the real threat to universities came 
      not from students but from government. Students were a minor irritant in 
      academic life, but governments were now bent on destroying the autonomy of 
      the institutions of civil society. Students merely functioned as their 
      fifth column. They had the effect of forcing universities even more into a 
      public domain. Students wanted the academic to become the political and 
      that was the effect they had. Before 1960 universities largely ran their 
      own affairs. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, they had all 
      succumbed to the state subsidies that destroyed their autonomy. 
      <P class=ind>The success of the radical feminist assault on European 
      civilization operated in a parallel fashion. “You say you believe in equal 
      opportunities for women, but why are there no women in management, or as 
      bishops, or as professors, or heads of big corporations?” “Why are women 
      paid on average only <I>x</I> percent of what men get paid?” The real 
      answers to these questions would take one deep into the role and structure 
      of the traditional family, the difference between the things that make men 
      and women happy, and the different relative suitability of men and women 
      for different tasks. And such real answers would obviously have to 
      dissolve the rather gross distinction between “men” and “women” in order 
      to recognize that, over a wide range of activities, especially activities 
      such as those of management, it was the individual that counted, not what 
      in technical femspeak is called “gender.” 
      <P class=ind>Any recognition of these complexities dissolved before the 
      fact that the questions being asked were rhetorical. In fact, as with 
      student radicals, they were not questions at all, but slogans masquerading 
      as questions. These pseudo-questions set the agenda, and the only 
      admissible answers would be the dogmas of the doctrine: Only patriarchal 
      oppression prevented men and women being equally represented in “positions 
      of power.” 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he politics of this assault were clear enough, 
      and they illustrate what Mancur Olsen diagnosed as the Achilles heel of 
      democracy: that a small group passionately campaigning for specific 
      benefits will always prevail against a large majority whose direct 
      interests are but marginally affected. Radical feminists were a relatively 
      small group, but their message was plausible at some level to most women, 
      and in families men had wives and daughters whose good they wished to 
      promote. No political party would take up all of this program, but it did 
      electoral prospects no harm to convey a general sympathy for the cause, 
      and once in government enthusiasts would advance legislation under the 
      motherhood slogan of equal opportunity. Very soon a network of powerful 
      bureaucracies was bringing radical doctrine to bear on all areas of 
      government. The courts could be relied upon to extend their power by 
      regulating contract and by extending the law of tort. Within a generation, 
      the revolution had not only succeeded but also created throughout Western 
      nations an occupying army of equal opportunity officers entrenched in 
      personnel departments up and down the country. 
      <P class=ind>And why not? It might well be demanded. Many women have great 
      abilities and a modern society ought not to abide by conventions which may 
      have been necessary in the past but which progress had made unnecessary. 
      The most successful societies have been those in which women have been 
      freest to participate widely. All of that is true and was already 
      recognized in the advance of liberal feminism before the 1960s. The 
      problem only arises with female quotas throughout the world of work. 
      <P class=ind>In a few significant areas, however, no such demands are 
      made. These areas are either where women graduates have no wish to go 
      (rough outdoor work) or where lack of ability could lead to instant 
      disaster, such as brain surgery or piloting commercial aircraft. Women are 
      to be found in both, but only on the basis of ability. Universities are 
      obviously a soft touch because the consequences of educational betrayal 
      take decades to emerge. The effect of university quotas for “gender 
      diversity” for example has often been to fill humanities departments with 
      women in order to equalize numbers “distorted” (one might say) by 
      technology and the hard sciences where even passably able women are hard 
      to come by. Many women in the humanities departments are indeed very able, 
      but many are not, and they have often prospered by setting up fanciful 
      ideological courses (especially in women’s studies), which can hardly 
      pretend to be academic at all. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>W</FONT>hat however of areas where women are patently 
      unsuited—such as the army, the police force, or fire fighting? They have 
      in fact all been under attack because although women are unsuited to the 
      rough work at the bottom, these areas have enviable managerial 
      opportunities higher up. They are one more irresistible gravy train. The 
      fire-fighting case was dramatized by the New York judicial decision that a 
      test of fitness for the force that nearly all women failed must be 
      discriminatory, and therefore illegal, an extension of the idea of “the 
      rule of law” far beyond any serious meaning. This was the doctrine called 
      “disparate impact.” Similar considerations have affected women in the 
      armed forces. Standards of entry have been lowered in order that women may 
      qualify. One argument for so doing is that the rejected tests looked for 
      qualities only rarely needed in the field, and that may indeed be true. 
      Yet, the idea that soldiers are heroic figures doing something that women 
      generally cannot do has forever been part of the self-understanding of 
      men, even those who have never heard a shot fired in anger. A small boy 
      inclined to cry out at the sting of iodine or the prick of an injection 
      might be told “be a soldier.” Today according to the feminist doctrine he 
      is more likely to be told to express his feelings. 
      <P class=ind>The assault of women on areas such as the church raises 
      similar issues. In principle there is not the slightest reason why women 
      should not take on a priestly role, and one might indeed suspect that 
      feminists may be right in diagnosing resistance in part to an unhealthy 
      attitude to women on the part of some of the clergy. In a pastoral role, 
      women might well be better than men, as some women are in politics. The 
      problem is that women priests raise very awkward questions of Christian 
      theology. Jesus selected only male disciples. Was the son of God then 
      merely a creature of his own culture? Here most conspicuously the entry of 
      women changes entirely the conception of the activity and not for the 
      better. Female clergy have done little to reverse the current decline of 
      the church. Indeed while women as individuals have often enhanced what 
      they have joined, the entry of women in general has seldom done much for 
      any area previously dominated by men—except, significantly, bureaucracy. 
      <P class=ind>It is the military case that is the most telling. No one 
      doubts the inferiority of women in physical strength and sport. No 
      football team would think of fielding women against a first-class team of 
      men. Yet the governments of Western countries, currently feeling 
      unthreatened by any major military power, are prepared to gamble their 
      security on female warriors. It would not be so serious if female 
      battalions had been formed whose performance in action could over time be 
      tested in real situations without endangering the security of Western 
      countries. But the feminist program is to make the army, like the rest of 
      society, conform to an idea, and the women want to go where the men are, 
      to be fully integrated so that when dirty and unfeminine jobs must be 
      done, there are men to do them. Liberal feminists took the risk of setting 
      up academic colleges of their own, but radical feminists needed to have 
      men around. They wanted to be integrated. And all of this happened not 
      because political wisdom declared it necessary for the defence of the 
      country, nor because the electorates pushed for it, but as the result of 
      agencies set up legal and bureaucratic strings. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>L</FONT>et us now return to the teasing question of why 
      the male custodians of our civilization sold the pass. Some element of 
      cowardice must certainly be recognized, because the radicals were tribal 
      warriors making ferocious faces and stamping their feet. The defenders 
      were white, male, and middle class, and the radicals had long been engaged 
      in a campaign to erode the morale of each of these abstract categories. 
      They denoted racism, sexism, and elitism respectively. Caricatured in 
      terms of these abstractions, men found it difficult not to be written off 
      as oppressors of women. Again, the defenders were not united. Many had 
      been longstanding advocates of liberal feminism and from confusion 
      believed that radical feminism was merely a rather hysterical version of 
      classical liberalism. Retreat is a notoriously difficult maneuver to 
      control. Each concession could be used to demand further concessions in 
      the name of consistency. Hence the appearance in all English-speaking 
      countries of legislation mandating equal opportunities—and who could 
      possibly be against that? Before long, the movement had taken over the 
      universities, many public bodies, industrial firms and, above all, the 
      media. Quite rapidly, hiring for status-giving jobs requiring degrees had 
      become closely circumscribed by a set of rules. The dogma was that 50 
      percent of all jobs belonged to women, though the reality of quotas was 
      long denied. 
      <P class=ind>There are, of course, deeper currents. One of them is that 
      men tended to react to radical feminism with a high-minded feeling that 
      nothing but justice, a notoriously fluid idea, should determine public 
      policy. The balancing of justice with power, which constitutes the art of 
      prudence, was being lost. This was a collapse of practical wisdom not 
      difficult to explain. It is a consequence, we may guess, of the collapse 
      of religion in the West. Christianity requires individuals to sacrifice 
      everything for the nicest points of perfection, but it does not require 
      that worldly institutions should do the same. But cocooned as prosperous 
      Westerners so often are from the immediate consequences of folly, and 
      increasingly detached from any profound understanding of the culture that 
      had produced them, the trustees of our civilization have indulged in the 
      most exquisite forms of self-abnegation. They were soon believing, for 
      example, that language itself had rendered women invisible and that 
      justice required the corrective use of the generic feminine. They were no 
      doubt able to indulge such fancies because they had long ago picked up the 
      idea that political correctness was really a bit of a joke, something of 
      no practical significance in the real world. Hardly a week could pass 
      without some piece of politically correct absurdity surfacing and being 
      laughed over and forgotten by the men who had now lost both the will and 
      the capacity to resist. 
      <P class=ind>But beyond lie far deeper currents in Western societies. Just 
      as the ferment in universities led rapidly to the state taking them over, 
      so the ferment of radical feminism carries out the old Bolshevik program 
      of creating a community of homogeneous creatures animated by some single 
      project —in fact, the totalitarianism which, as an external assault on the 
      walls of the West, we thought we had vanquished in battle with external 
      enemies. 
      <P class=ind>My view is, then, that the radical feminist revolution is 
      nothing less than a destruction of our civilization. It has all happened 
      in such a way that people have not yet realized what has happened. And 
      there are some who might say, well, at least it has improved the condition 
      of women. But this, I think, is a mistake. Such a view would accept the 
      initial dichotomy, so fatal to European civilization, that men and women 
      have separate destinies. In fact, of course, they do not. Still, it is no 
      easy business to give an account of quite how they fit together. Indeed, 
      no comprehensive theory of this relationship can be given. But many things 
      we can confidently say. One is that women have specifically feminine 
      qualities of their own which prevent them, as a general rule, from fitting 
      entirely successfully into the structures men have created. No problem, 
      say the radical feminists: let us change the structures! That can indeed 
      be done, but something is lost. The point is that “men” put “women” (if we 
      may generalize wildly) on a pedestal, and also despise them as weak; love 
      and adore them in chivalrous terms, but also tend to oppress them and use 
      them. A parallel ambivalence will be found in the way women treat men. A 
      whole world of games and conventions has grown up around these attitudes, 
      and they look different viewed from the barracks and from the bedroom, in 
      the sitting room or in the shop. Radical feminism is essentially a 
      humorless rationalism which seeks a single right attitude to be imposed on 
      men and women alike. 
      <P class=ind>There is a further point, and a more complex one. European 
      civilization, we might say, has only stayed ahead of the game of world 
      power because it is so remarkably innovative. It lives off ideas. 
      Sometimes academics attempt the paradoxical business of trying to theorize 
      innovation and creativity, but the results are inevitably banal. 
      Creativity is essentially mysterious. Yet every so often, some movement 
      gets into its head the idea that it has cracked the innovation code and 
      found the formula for progress. This is what I am inclined to call the 
      Bolshevik fallacy, because Lenin and his associates actually believed it, 
      and the Soviet Union showed us what happens as a result of such hubris. 
      <P class=ind>But the problem is wider. The whole world is now involved in 
      the business of modernization, which means copying the mode of life 
      constantly being transformed in Europe, and now in America—by white males, 
      now often joined by clever individuals (both men and women) from other 
      parts of the world. Globalization and the computer are the latest of the 
      marvels with which our civilization has astonished the world. The point is 
      that so far, no other civilization has been able to pick up the torch of 
      innovative leadership. It may even be that Europeans themselves have lost 
      the trick, or gone as far as they can go; or it may not. We simply cannot 
      know. 
      <P class=ind>What does seem to be clear, from the record so far, is that 
      women do not have this capacity to innovate. They bring great talents to 
      developing what Thomas Kuhn called “normal science,” but they have no 
      record of creating the “paradigm shifts” that lead in new directions. It 
      may be, of course, that as the feminists sometimes claim, this is because 
      they were never encouraged to engage in these activities. But to need 
      encouragement, to depend on models to follow, is precisely not to have a 
      capacity to innovate. It has been men who have invented things and found 
      challenges in nature, such as climbing high mountains or sailing alone 
      around the world. And once men have done it, women will also do it. These 
      remain highly notable enterprises, well beyond the reach of all but a few 
      men, but they also exemplify the fact that innovation remains largely the 
      specialization of white males. Women can do marvellous things with a 
      house, but they do need the house to be there in the first place. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>M</FONT>y argument is, then, that European civilization 
      has been attacked and conquered from within, without anyone quite 
      realizing what has happened. We may laugh at political correctness—some 
      people even deny that it exists—but it is a manacle around our hands. It 
      binds us quite tightly, though some freedom must be left, because without 
      the contribution of subjugated males, things would very rapidly decline. 
      What political correctness amounts to in reality is a treaty of 
      accommodation reached between the conquerors and the conquered. Women have 
      forced their way into money and status, sometimes beyond their merits, but 
      they have also lost a freedom (Professor Schaub calls it “leisure”) that 
      might have saved them from being formularized in terms of contemporary 
      Western styles of work. Had this not happened, we might well have been 
      saved from some of the discontents that currently afflict us. To be 
      “socially included,” as women have been in the workforce, has many 
      practical advantages, but it involves a spiritual loss. So far the 
      conquerors have not destroyed the geese that lay the golden eggs, so the 
      surface of our civilization does not reveal how profound the change has 
      been. But underneath that surface, there are currents which no one 
      understands. 
      <P class=ind>There has been a revolution, then, but a silent one. It has 
      taken place with such stealth, and so gradually, that people have become 
      accustomed to it little by little. I am reminded of the famous Chinese 
      executioner whose ambition it was to be able to cut off a head so that the 
      victim would not realize what had happened. For years he worked on his 
      skill, and one day he cut off a head so perfectly that the victim said: 
      “Well, when are you going to do it?” The executioner gave a beatific smile 
      and said: “Just kindly nod.” <!-- Notes start here --><!-- 1 were found -->
