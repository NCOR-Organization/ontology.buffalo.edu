<P align=justify>The post-Cold War period has opened the doors for the emergence 
of old disputes between nations and peoples. These disputes, without the 
presence of bipolar "checks and balances" conducted between the two former 
superpowers, emerge in an age where the abundance of improved conventional 
weaponry and the surge of interest in Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) allow 
rivalries to settle their disputes in a variety of conventional and 
unconventional means. </P>
<P align=justify>Terrorism has emerged once again as the preferred means of the 
minority to make itself heard in the world arena. This threat has the potential 
to not only spread within emerging democracies through ethnic, religious, or 
revolutionary armed struggle but also threatens the very nature of a democratic 
society and its attempt to provide the individual his "unalienable rights" as a 
citizen within that democratic state.</P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896804></A><A name=_Toc441912476>2. The Problem of Defining 
Terrorism</A> </P></B>
<P align=justify>The first problem that faces states in dealing with terrorism 
is arriving at a definition that has consensus among all the nations. This is 
especially problematic when dealing with the various forms of terrorism (e.g. 
ethnic, religious, revolutionary, etc.). Lack of a consensual definition for 
terrorism makes cooperation between nations difficult, i.e., when it comes to 
fight terrorism or during<B> </B>negotiations for extradition purposes. 
Definitions of terrorism vary between nations and within states because of 
various factors. </P>
<P align=justify>First, political opposition occurs between agencies attempting 
to categorize terrorism as an ordinary crime or some other form of violence. 
Secondly, there is also disagreement concerning the nature of political violence 
and the power struggle terrorism takes against the state. Finally, specific 
causes resorting to political violence differ among the actors which clouds the 
issue of whether or not the act is political or extremist in nature.</P>
<P align=justify>The first component that hinders consensus in defining 
terrorism is the question whether political opposition is simply a crime or 
something else. The word ‘terror’ was first used in connection with the Jacobin 
"Reign of Terror" after the French Revolution of 1789. During the years 
1793-1794, revolutionary terrorism broke out with Robespierre, Saint-Just, 
Marat, and Fouche. In this short period of time, the lives of 40,000 people were 
ended and 300,000 were imprisoned. A small group of men ruled 27 million 
Frenchman through the threat of violence. Since then, the term terrorism is 
emotionally charged and the symbol of the "Reign of Terror" gave birth to this 
new form of political violence.</P>
<P align=justify>Irrespective of possible definitions, terrorism has different 
goals than the ordinary criminal. First of all, terrorism is intended to produce 
fear on society through its indiscriminate acts of violence. It is a 
psychological act conducted for its impact upon society as a whole and seeks to 
destroy the vary fabric that binds society to state. Whereas the ordinary 
criminal is only interested in the benefits that he will attain for himself 
through his criminal act, the terrorist may be motivated by political, 
religious, or ideological objectives. Thus, terrorism distinguishes itself from 
other violent acts merely aimed at personal gain.</P>
<P align=justify>Terrorism is a term of uncertain legal content. The term itself 
has no definition of illegality, except when terrorism commits acts which do 
apply to common law. Some of the acts that a terrorist commits are murder, 
bombing, kidnapping, hijacking, hostage taking, and theft. All these acts have a 
law in the civil penal code that makes a terrorist’s activity a crime against 
society. However, calling one a terrorist does not make them a criminal but does 
imply illegality. The person or group must first commit one of the above 
mentioned acts before the law can prosecute the accused.</P>
<P align=justify>All definitions of terrorism, even though not written the same, 
do share similarities. In all instances, terrorism is viewed as a political act 
against a government and its citizenry. Secondly, terrorism is viewed as a 
coercive means to change some policy through the application of violence upon 
society. Finally, each example adheres to the unlawfulness of terrorism as a 
mode of political change. For the purpose of this paper terrorism is defined as 
"a strategy whereby violence is used to produce certain effects in a group of 
people so as to attain some political end or ends."</P>
<P align=justify>The changing methods that terrorists apply today add "a new 
dimension to an old threat." Terrorism still remains horrifying in its nature 
since it strikes at the lives of innocent people that have nothing to do with 
the reason for their grievances. It still provokes uncertainty through its 
randomness and indiscriminate attacks, but it became highly dependent of the 
mass media. Terrorism also remains a political act as seen in the various 
ethnic-separatist movements, e.g. ETA and the IRA. These groups have adapted 
themselves to combining violence with the political process through a political 
wing representing the terrorist group’s strategic agenda. </P>
<P align=justify>However, post-modern terrorism has introduced a new element 
into the equation. Recently, the world has been witnessing the rise of extremist 
organizations, such as <I>AUM</I> <I>Supreme</I> and other extremist 
millenarians. Although one can say that their objectives are political, it can 
also be argued that their objectives have no politics to them since they are 
promoting the end of civilization. These groups are extremely dangerous and have 
absolutely no regard for human life since it is not of their concern what 
effects it may have on the victim and society. Therefore, these groups are not 
interested in coercing society. They are interested in destroying it.</P>
<P align=justify>In the light of this new age in terrorism, perhaps Vladimir 
Lenin said it best that the "purpose of terrorism is to terrorize." Prof. 
Richard E. Rubinstein, Center for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at the George 
Mason University, in May 1990 said, "…a definition of terrorism is 
hopeless….terrorism is just violence that you don’t like." The situation that 
states face is that terrorism can mean anything anyone wants it to mean 
dependent on their political position. The one thing that is certain is that 
terrorism is increasingly violent.</P><B>
<P>3. Terrorism and Western Political Thought</P>
<P align=justify></B>Terrorism’s political violence and power struggle against 
the state is a direct challenge to the ideas of liberal western thought. Western 
ideology believes that man is a free-willing individual, endowed with reason and 
moral responsibility. It is in this basic belief that liberal thinkers stressed 
the importance of a human’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. Tyrannical governments that violate the rule of law which protects 
individual rights and liberties violate what John Locke (and others) calls the 
"social contract", a contract that is established between citizen and state. 
Does this violation justify the right of man to revolt? The medieval philosopher 
Thomas Aquinas stated that "tyrannical government is unjust because it is not 
directed to the common good but to the private good of the ruler." Aquinas 
continued by saying that "the overthrow of such a government is not strictly 
sedition, unless perhaps when accompanied by such tyrannical government." This 
concept could become relevant to terrorists who place moral justification in 
their use of violence against the state and society. </P>
<P align=justify>But not all political philosophers thought the same way about 
despotic and tyrannical forms of government. Philosophers such as Trassymachus, 
Machiavelli, and Hobbes have argued the opposite about tyrannical forms of 
government. Machiavelli, in his <I>The Prince</I>, cannot help but admire the 
skill which Agathocles exercised in taking over power from the senate. 
Machiavelli believed that a successful Prince is one that can rule by "cunning 
Realpolitik" in order to maintain his power as ruler. For Thomas Hobbes the 
"greatest good was Order defined as a state of civil peace, and the greatest 
evil was anarchy, ‘a condition of warre’ of all against all." In his 
<I>Leviathan</I>, he states that all men should place their natural rights to 
unlimited freedom under the direct and absolute authority of the sovereign. In 
this Hobbesonian Commonwealth, man and sovereign have established a covenant 
that secures social peace. The ruler must therefore have sufficient power to 
establish and maintain order within society. Thus, rebellion can never be 
justified since society has established a Covenant with the sovereign who 
ensures order upon his subjects that guarantees their basic rights to life.</P>
<P align=justify>But guaranteeing the basic rights to life does not seem to be 
enough in the new strategic age and the modern liberal state. Recently, with the 
rise of ethnic struggle in the various nations that are no longer under the yoke 
of Soviet rule, we see that the desire for self-determination again aspires to 
be a basic political right. But does this strive for itself justify the use of 
violence against existing political entities in order to attain the desired 
objective? The theory of social contract in its various forms argues that if man 
were left to his own vices without any social control, he would create a state 
of anarchy. By agreeing to accept the rules and norms of society and accepting 
the obligation to obey the laws of the state, the human being exchanges certain 
(natural) powers and freedoms for the security and safety the state offers. "A 
necessary condition for the establishment of a civil society or commonwealth is 
the willingness of its members individually and collectively to accept its laws, 
adjudication’s and punishments as authoritative and binding."</P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896805></A><A name=_Toc441912477>4. Political Fundamentals in 
Civil Society and State</A> </P></B>
<P align=justify>In western democratic states, social contract theory still has 
viability in modern doctrines of representation and democratic participation. 
"Citizens that have the opportunity to elect representatives into government on 
the basis of universal suffrage and free elections can be argued that such 
participation implicitly obliges them to abide by the decisions of a government 
enjoying majority support among the electorate." </P>
<P align=justify>Democracies must adhere to individual freedom and liberties 
while maintaining "the rule of law." John Locke relied on the legislative branch 
to be the "lynchpin" of civil government through the adherence of laws. The 
legislative branch was the protector of the people. It protected the people from 
the executive by placing it under the legislative branch’s control. Locke 
established guiding principles for the legislative branch of government:<SUP> 
</P></SUP>
<P align=justify>Firstly, they are to govern by promulgated established laws, 
not to be varied in particular cases, but to have one rule for rich and poor, 
for the favorite at Court, and the country-man at plough.</P>
<P align=justify>Secondly, these laws also ought to be designed for no other end 
ultimately but the good of the people.</P>
<P align=justify>Thirdly, they must not raises taxes on the property of the 
people without the consent of the people given by themselves or their 
deputies.</P>
<P align=justify>Fourthly, the legislative neither must nor can transfer the 
power of making laws to anybody else, or place it anywhere but where the people 
have.</P>
<P align=justify>However, in modern democratic societies there must be an 
institution that specializes in the interpretation of such laws, adjudicates, 
and administers the law. This judicial institution must be impartial and 
protected from political control. This control measure is essential for society 
to establish any operative rule of law. The principle of rule of law and 
judicial independence remain an essential part of both the theory and practice 
of the modern liberal state.</P>
<P align=justify>Exactly at this point terrorism sets in. For ideological 
reasons, the terrorist denies the legitimacy of this contract or the way it is 
being carried out by the state. This discontent seems to justify the terrorist’s 
resort to violence. </P>
<P align=justify>Due to their very nature, modern democratic states have always 
been vulnerable to terrorism. Modern democratic states serve to protect the 
security of its citizens by enacting and enforcing laws which are designed to 
protect their fundamental interests.</P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896806></A><A name=_Toc441912478>5. Terrorism and Modern Civil 
Societies</A></P></B>
<P align=justify>Given the destructiveness of post-modern terrorism, it is the 
responsibility of the state to utilize whatever means it has to protect 
societies’ interests against terrorism. Since terrorism is a form of war, it is 
also appropriate for liberal states to utilize the military as an instrument to 
fight the terrorist threat. However, "should the state start to use 
countermeasures of an illegal or unconstitutional manner, it runs the very grave 
risk of undermining its own legitimacy and, hence, creating a situation worse 
than the problem it is trying to relieve." Therefore, two underlying principles 
hold true for democratic states: (1) liberal democratic principles require that 
the state take action against terrorism, and (2) that the actions taken adhere 
to liberal democratic conceptions of constitutional authority.</P>
<P align=justify>Terrorism has changed over the years by evolving its tactics 
and strategy to fit the new political world arena. One important element, 
however, has not changed in terrorism, namely that it continues to be a method 
in which minority groups express their political and strategic desires through 
violence against the legitimate state. Throughout history, regimes and 
opposition groups have resorted to terrorism for the purpose of attaining 
political ends. Acts of terrorism have been both psychological and physical in 
their nature through intimidation, coercion, and repression. As mentioned above, 
these actions against society attempt to destabilize the regime that makes 
terrorism different than an ordinary crime. Noemi Gal-Or, author of a book that 
deals with international cooperation to fight terrorism, writes: "Terrorism is 
political because its perpetrators pretend to represent some segment of the 
political scene, and it has socio-political underpinning as well as 
consequences." </P>
<P align=justify>Post-modern terrorism threatens democracies new and old. The 
nature of democratic societies makes it easy for the terrorist to organize and 
operate. Democratic societies are open societies that promote the individual 
rights and freedoms of the citizens. Liberal societies also have a mass media 
that enjoys a freedom unprecedented in history with today’s new technological 
developments in communication and transportation. Democracies risk in their 
counter-terrorism policies of being too repressive, thus weakening democratic 
values. The type and amount of force a democracy utilizes in countering the 
terrorist must be weighed carefully prior to any sort of commitment by the 
state. It is important to keep in mind what the strategic goal of the terrorist 
is: reduce societal confidence in the state by showing the repressive nature of 
the political administration in power and "enhance the attractiveness of the 
political alternative the terrorists represent."</P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896807></A><A name=_Toc441912479>5.1. Tactics and Motivation 
of Terrorists</A></P></B>
<P align=justify>The uniqueness of the political violence associated with 
terrorism in connection with the nature of the modern state makes it an 
extremely dangerous threat to liberal democracies. With regard to the 
effectiveness of anti-terrorist policies Christopher Hewitt states that 
"terrorist acts are decisions made by individuals who are members of 
identifiable organizations with distinctive characteristics." Terrorism’s goal 
of political change is attained by means of subversive acts against the state. 
</P>
<P align=justify>Post-modern terrorist tactics are often related to the violent 
strategic framework of various revolutionary forces engaging in civil war, 
guerilla warfare, and international war. Political groups that employ terrorism 
as a strategy are often similar to other voluntary organizations such as an 
insurgent group. Each terrorist organization has a structure that is capable of 
collective decision making and there is normally a hierarchy within the 
organizations that often follows military rank structure. In other words, there 
are leaders at different levels within the organization coordinating and 
directing the collective goals to achieve their overall political aims.</P>
<P align=justify>Post-modern terrorists are very often ambitious, calling for 
radical changes within society through the restructuring of the legitimacy of 
existing political and social elites. Martha Crenshaw, an expert in issues 
involving terrorism, states that "the causes are numerous and varying, logical 
and understandable as well as emotional and irrational." </P>
<P align=justify>These causes can be from resistance to a foreign ruler, drives 
to change political and social reality to bring about revolution, or desire for 
some spiritual purification. Regardless of the cause, the terrorist considers 
himself on a moral and justified crusade against an oppressor that leaves little 
room for compromise. This moral "crusade" allows the terrorist to utilize almost 
any means to obtain his strategic objective. The most effective means that the 
post-modern terrorist has incorporated has been the attack on the innocent in 
order to convince governments to take the terrorist’s demands seriously. 
Post-modern terrorism not only threatens the safety of society but also 
challenges the very nature of the modern democratic state. Terrorism’s political 
violence and power struggle against the state is a direct challenge to the ideas 
of liberal western thought.<B> </B>Liberal thinkers have always stressed the 
moral values of the individual, as a significantly distinct part of human 
nature. </P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896808></A><A name=_Toc441912480>5.2. Theory and Practice of 
Justifying Terrorism</A></P></B>
<P align=justify>A principle of Western thinking is also that the decision to 
use violence or political force can only be justified if the act is conducted as 
a last resort of (self-) defense to preserve political justice. Terrorist groups 
that choose to use the tool of violence will often do so without exploring other 
legitimate options because they do not bring about the rapid change that is 
desired by such groups. The case of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (more 
commonly known as the IRA) provides a good illustration of an illegitimate 
terrorist campaign that has decided to exercise its internal struggle in 
Northern Ireland without seeking other means short of violence. Irish Catholics 
has their own parliament enabling them to participate in the decision-making 
process after the Irish civil war ended in 1992 and a signing of a treaty 
between the free state of Ireland and the British government. This, however, did 
not stop a minority of Catholics from continuing their struggle against England. 
The battle cry that has been heard by the IRA was for the removal of the British 
government from Northern Ireland and the union of all the provinces (IRA’s 
strategic political goal). This, of course, is the desire for 
"self-determination" and not self-defense. The British were not threatening the 
lives of Irish Catholics and agreed to give them the southern part of the 
island. Although many were satisfied with the arrangement, hard-core zealots 
within the IRA were not, thus splitting from the mainstream and forming the 
Provisional Irish Republican Army. It was not until the late 60s and early 70s 
that the British introduction of military force and the unfortunate events that 
occurred on January 30, 1972, known as Bloody Sunday, caused violence to 
escalate. However, the internal struggle and political terrorism conducted by 
the IRA is still unjustifiable because of their unwillingness to participate in 
the normal political process. </P>
<P align=justify>If ever, political terrorism seems only to be justifiable under 
very strictly limited circumstances. The nature of the oppression must be severe 
enough to warrant such a reaction. "Severe enough" can only mean that the 
primary level of human rights, the right to live, is immediately threatened – 
for example, when a political regime kills people at will in the sense of 
committing progroms or ethnic cleansing. Once the right to life has been 
threatened, government is incapable of justifying its legitimacy over society, 
and is by doing so severely violating the social contract. </P>
<P align=justify>An example that demonstrates an argument supporting a terrorist 
campaign against a state is the <I>Montonero</I> movement in Argentina after the 
coup of 1955. The <I>Montoneros</I> sought to bring back Peron, the former 
president of Argentina, into power. Peron was seen by the <I>Peronistas</I> as a 
leader that supported the worker through various social programs that he had 
established in Argentina during his reign. His social programs, however, had 
significant economic impacts on the country that brought severe recessions to 
Argentina in the form of high inflation and high interest rates. Anti-Peronistas 
staged a coup in order to get the country out of this disastrous state of 
affairs. In 1956, a group of civilian and military officers staged a 
demonstration against the Anti-Peronista movement that has established reforms 
preventing Pro-Peronistas from having any say in the electoral process. This 
demonstration was brutally suppressed by the state. For the first time, the 
state was punishing dissenters with death. Based on these circumstances, the 
<I>Montonero</I> movement began its terrorist campaign against the state, 
targeting predominantly military and law-enforcement personnel. </P>
<P align=justify>Under the presumption that no other means were available, this 
event might carry an idea of a justifiable terrorist campaign since the state 
directly threatened the lives of those who rebelled against its unjustified 
laws. Moreover, the terrorist campaign’s primary targets tended to focus on 
those that represented the state (military and law-enforcement). The movement 
became "discriminatory" in its application of violence, reducing the likelihood 
of innocent victims. These factors gave the movement a certain level of 
legitimacy amongst society’s less affluent and increased the "de-legitimization" 
of the state. The state became illegitimate in the eyes of a modern civil 
society because it did not adhere to the "Rule of Law" by unjustly seeking out 
and destroying those who opposed (peacefully at first) the state’s policies 
against Peron.</P>
<P align=justify>These principles established justice as the primary aspect and 
responsibility that the state owed society. Freedom in the sense of confining 
itself by justice, was only of secondary importance. Society could only exercise 
freedom as long as it did not usurp justice. This condition questions the 
suitability of means one uses in attempting to gain his or her freedom from the 
state. If the means are not just by violating the laws established within 
society through the social contract, then the action cannot be ethically or 
morally legitimized. Terrorists, more often than not, use the tool of violence 
not against the "guilty" but rather against the innocent. They randomly target 
open society in order to intimidate and coerce the state. Therefore, terrorism 
that targets the innocent can never be justified.</P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896809></A><A name=_Toc441912481>5.3. The Separation of Powers 
and Countering Terrorism</A></P></B>
<P align=justify>The "Rule of Law" that guides society, defines what is justice 
and grants the state the authority to govern. The principle of the rule of law 
and judicial independence remain an essential part of both the theory and 
practice of the modern liberal state. This impartiality through the judiciary’s 
political independence is also a key when discussing the means in which to 
counter terrorists from attacking the state. Once justification for the state’s 
use of violence against a terrorist is established by the impartial 
interpretation of the rule of law, society can support such actions. The 
antithesis to this is the state’s use of violence without the backing of the 
rule of law. Such actions would be reviewed as de-legitimizing the state in the 
eyes of society. Therefore, ways and means to counter terrorism are equally 
important to the state as in the decision by terrorists to conduct a campaign of 
violence against the state.</P>
<P align=justify>It has been made apparent by many scholars that terrorism and 
the methods of countering this threat are predominantly a law-enforcement 
matter. </P>
<P align=justify>Western democratic societies will typically adopt the criminal 
justice model in countering terrorism by utilizing the state’s law-enforcement 
agencies despite the availability of military resources. The fear of recognizing 
the political role of the terrorist prevents western societies from adopting the 
war model in countering the terrorist threat. This position was best summarized 
by Jeannou Lacaze during his report on European terrorism, given to the European 
Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security on 02 February 
1994:</FONT><FONT face="Bookman,Bookman Old Style" size=1> </P></FONT><FONT 
face="Bookman,Bookman Old Style"><B>
<UL>
  <UL></B>
    <P align=justify>"Terrorism is a peacetime problem, which must be tackled 
    using peacetime remedies. Even if one is firmly convinced that this is a new 
    type of war being waged against our remedies, there is no justification for 
    applying wartime legislation. This would leave the way open for legal 
    abuses, whose short-term consequences would be as serious as terrorism 
    itself…Instead the full force of law must be brought into play on the basis 
    of existing charges to ensure that those responsible are no longer a threat 
    to society. A terrorist is first and foremost a common criminal and should 
    be convicted as such."</P><B></UL></UL></B>
<P align=justify>As pointed out earlier, a terrorist is not a common criminal. 
Hence, treating a terrorist as a common criminal has two potential dangers: (1) 
Over-reaction by the state and (2) Refusal to take any decisive judicial or 
law-enforcement action against those who threaten the rule of law.</P>
<P align=justify>Labeling terrorism as a common crime can place state officials 
in a position that provokes them into making "radical and unjustified departures 
from conventional judicial and law-enforcement procedures. This begins to occur 
when law-enforcement officials in conjunction with the polity perceive that the 
constitutional safeguards which are built into the rule of law prevent the state 
agencies from accomplishing their mission against the terrorist. The rules and 
rights that are traditionally enshrined in the principle of due process begin to 
be misinterpreted or completely disregarded. The internment policy established 
by the British government against the IRA is a good example of this 
over-reaction conducted by the state. The British government stated that "…the 
IRA had become an inflexible, militarily autonomous organization, its violence 
being wholly unregulated by any meaningful political authority." Thousands of 
Irish Catholics were imprisoned with suspicion of being members of the IRA or 
abetting the terrorist organization. This policy resulted in the deterioration 
of the relationship between the Irish Catholics and the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary assisted by the British Army. This did not ultimately reduce the 
violence between the IRA and British forces but instead increased the animosity 
towards the northern government of Ireland and increased the support base for 
the IRA throughout all of Ireland.</P>
<P align=justify>The second danger in labeling terrorism as a common crime is 
the refusal of the state in taking any decisive judicial or law-enforcement 
action against the terrorist organization. In this case, law-enforcement 
officials hope that the terrorist organization will eventually be encouraged to 
adhere to accepted legal standards and practices. This is to occur by certain 
appeasement’s being granted to the terrorists by the state through negotiated 
settlements. The danger in appeasing terrorists is that the state opens itself 
up to additional future attacks by the same methodology utilized by other 
groups. This undermines public security and only encourages future terrorist 
threats against the state. This is best put in the words of Paul Wilkinson in 
his book, <I>Terrorism and the Liberal State</I>:</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <P align=justify>If a democratic government caves into extremist movement 
    and allows them to subvert and openly defy the laws and to set themselves up 
    as virtual rival governments within the state, the liberal democracy will 
    dissolve into an anarchy of competing factions and enclaves.</P></UL></UL>
<P align=justify>An example of law-enforcement refusing to take any decisive 
action against a terrorist organization was witnessed in Japan during the 
numerous complaints brought against Aum Supreme Truth and its leader, Shoko 
Asahara. It was not until the assault on the Egawa compound (after the Sakamoto 
murders) that authorities uncovered the cult’s interest with chemical weapons. 
This discovery did not prevent the attack on the Tokyo subway on March 20, 1995, 
which left 12 people dead and injuring over 6,000.</P><B>
<P><A name=_Toc441896810></A><A name=_Toc441912482>5.4. Categorization of 
Terrorism</A> </P></B>
<P align=justify>Treating terrorism as a common crime can have severe 
repercussions on society and its perception of the state in how it deals with 
terrorism. Terrorism is not a common crime, as mentioned throughout this paper, 
but rather a "subspecies" of revolutionary tactics or guerrilla warfare. Not all 
forms of terrorism can be considered revolutionary or political. For example, 
extremist millenarians whose only strategic objective is to destroy society 
cannot be considered revolutionary even though they will ultimately effect the 
state. These terrorists have no ideology - unlike ethnic/nationalist terrorists 
that promote a certain culture or political ideology. Justification in using 
military force can only be justified once western liberal democracies can accept 
the notion that terrorism is a form of warfare (low-intensity conflict (LIC) or 
guerrilla warfare). Western democracies will be more willing to utilize military 
resources once the threat of terrorism becomes more persistent and dangerous. 
</P>
<P align=justify>Categorizing terrorism as a form of guerrilla warfare has not 
been popular in western states. There is always the fear that by allowing the 
military to respond to these sorts of threats, civilian control of the military 
becomes jeopardized. This of course is a danger unless the political leadership 
involves itself with the operational planning of the anti-terrorist campaign. 
Treating terrorism as a form of warfare must involve both a political decision 
and counter-terrorist concept along with an adequate military policy to counter 
the threat of terrorism. </P>
<P align=justify>Another argument against categorizing terrorists as 
‘Guerrillas’ revolves around the issue of tactics. Walter Laqueur makes an 
argument against categorizing terrorists as Guerrillas. He states that "while 
guerrillas have quite frequently used terrorist tactics vis-à-vis their enemies, 
the opposite has virtually never happened, for in the urban milieu there are no 
opportunities for guerrilla warfare…urban slums or wealthy quarters do not 
provide the sanctuary given by the jungle or distant mountain regions." However, 
it seems to be a fundamental mistake in misinterpreting the differences in 
terrain and the type of effects necessary to achieve the military objective of 
the guerrilla/terrorist.</P>
<P align=justify>Terrorism in the new strategic age has become much more lethal. 
This increase in lethality is due to new technologies in communications, 
transportation, and the availability of WMDs. Post-modern terrorism, therefore, 
poses a much greater threat to western liberal states and their respective 
societies than it has in the past. Terrorists are much more indiscriminate in 
the selection of their targets; post-Cold War period has freed 
ethnic/nationalist disputes in various regions of the world; and, WMD 
availability gives the terrorist the ability to counter superior state security 
forces. In this society no form of violence, less self-defense, can be morally 
justified.</P>
<P align=justify>Unlike past guerrilla campaigns that attempted to follow a 
Maoist tradition of armed struggle in the sense of fighting a clearly identified 
adversary, post-modern terrorism follows whatever strategy it deems necessary to 
promote its agenda and to accomplish the political objectives. Critics of 
characterizing terrorism as a mode of warfare say that terrorists are not 
guerrillas because they do not seize any terrain. Post-modern terrorism does not 
need to seize terrain. Instead the importance for the terrorist in the new 
strategic age is who, what, when, where, and how he can effect his target(s) 
with the least risk to his forces. In essence, terrorism becomes a war of 
attrition. </P><B>

<P align=justify>Terrorists conduct their acts of violence outside the 
boundaries of societal norms. The monopoly of violence, in Western liberal 
states, remains with the legitimate entity based on the social contract that has 
been established between state and citizen. Terrorism violates that monopoly and 
thus becomes unlawful. It then becomes the responsibility of the state to 
enforce its laws and return order to society. The methodology of the type of 
response must have a legal basis in order to be acceptable to society. Moreover, 
since it is the responsibility of the state to re-establish order through legal 
means, the state must also consider the nature of the threat in determining the 
means of violence it must apply.</P>
<P align=justify>The nature of today’s terrorism cannot be countered with 
yesterday’s methods. Governments have to acknowledge that a threat to national 
security exists when they become threatened with post-modern terrorism. 
Law-enforcement is always preferable but the Military must always remain an 
option. It is the responsibility of the elected officials to understand the 
capabilities that the military can bring to bear against terrorism. However, 
senior military leaders also share in the responsibility of providing the 
political leadership the information required in making valid strategic 
decisions. Counter-terrorism must apply what Carl von Clausewitz termed as the 
"dual-nature" of warfare. </P>
<P align=justify>It is through this method that western liberal states can 
retain their legitimacy against the unlawful, immoral violence perpetrated by 
the terrorist.</P><B>
