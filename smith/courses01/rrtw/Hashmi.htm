            <P class=text-leftjustified>From <I>Encyclopedia of Politics and 
            Religion,</I> ed. Robert Wuthnow. 2 vols. (Washington, D.C.: 
            Congressional Quarterly, Inc., 1998), 425-426. </P>
            <P class=title>Jihad</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>The Islamic idea of <I>jihad,</I> which 
            is derived from the Arabic root meaning "to strive" or "to make an 
            effort," connotes a wide range of meanings, from an inward spiritual 
            struggle to attain perfect faith to an outward material struggle to 
            promote justice and the Islamic social system. The former meaning 
            was emphasized by Sufis (Muslim mystics), who popularized a 
            tradition describing the inner jihad as greater than the outer 
            jihad. When used in the latter sense, jihad is closely identified 
            with the injunction in the Qur'an, the revelation of God to the 
            prophet Muhammad, to the Muslim community to "command the right and 
            forbid the wrong" (3:104, 110). The close connection of jihad with 
            the struggle for justice is reinforced in the <I>hadith,</I> the 
            sayings and actions attributed to Muhammad. One of the best known 
            states that a Muslim must strive to avert injustice first by 
            actions, and if that is not possible, by words, and if that is not 
            possible, at least by intentions.</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>During the period of Qur'anic revelation 
            while Muhammad was in Mecca (610-622), jihad meant essentially a 
            nonviolent struggle to spread Islam. Following his move from Mecca 
            to Medina in 622, and the establishment of an Islamic state, 
            fighting in self-defense was sanctioned by the Qur'an (22:39). The 
            Qur'an began referring increasingly to <I>qital</I> (fighting or 
            warfare) as one form of jihad. Two of the last verses on this topic 
            (9:5, 29) suggest a war of conquest or conversion against all 
            unbelievers.</P>
            <P class=subtitle>The Medieval Doctrine</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>In medieval legal sources (compiled 
            roughly between the eighth and eleventh centuries), jihad generally 
            referred to a divinely sanctioned struggle to establish Muslim 
            hegemony over non-Muslims as a prelude to the propagation of the 
            Islamic faith. Islamic legal scholars divided the world into two 
            spheres: <I>Dar al-Islam</I> (land of Islam), where Islamic law 
            applied, and <I>Dar al-Harb</I> (land of war), where the absence of 
            Islamic law presumably fostered anarchy and immorality. The Islamic 
            state's duty was to reduce <I>Dar al-Harb</I>--through peaceful 
            means if possible, through war if necessary--until it had been 
            incorporated into <I>Dar al-Islam.</I> Jurists differed on the 
            possibility and duration of peace between the two spheres. The 
            majority held that jihad could be suspended if the Muslim commander 
            deemed it in the interest of the Islamic state, but usually not for 
            more than ten years. The Qur'anic verses that suggest peaceful 
            accommodation or coexistence with unbelievers (especially 2:193, 
            8:61) were declared abrogated by the later, more belligerent 
            ones.</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>The medieval theory included elaborate 
            rules on the right conduct of jihad. No war was a jihad unless 
            authorized and led by the <I>imam,</I> the leader of the Islamic 
            state. Enemies were to be given fair warning, and, should they 
            choose not to accept Islam or to fight, they were to be offered 
            protected <I>(dhimmi)</I> status, which allowed them to retain 
            communal autonomy within the Islamic state in return for tax 
            payments. This provision initially applied to Christians and Jews 
            but later was broadened to include other religious communities 
            living under Muslim rule. Noncombatants were not to be killed, nor 
            was enemy property to be destroyed unnecessarily. </P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>In addition to the expansionist jihad, 
            medieval scholars also dealt with internal conflicts against rebels 
            within Islam. In this form of jihad, stricter rules of engagement 
            and greater protection for the lives and property of the enemy 
            applied than in the case of non-Muslims. The aim of this type of 
            jihad was to rehabilitate the rebels as quickly as possible into the 
            Muslim body politic.</P>
            <P class=subtitle>Modern Interpretations</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>Three broad approaches to the modern 
            reinterpretation of jihad may be discerned. First, the apologetic 
            arose in the late nineteenth century in response to Western 
            criticism that jihad meant "holy war" and that Islam was spread 
            through force. Muslim apologists argued that the Qur'an and 
            Prophetic traditions allow war only for self-defense against 
            persecution and aggression. Some Muslim writers, particularly those 
            in British India, restricted even further the legitimate scope of 
            jihad by arguing that so long as no direct threat to Islamic worship 
            was posed by European imperialists Muslims should not challenge 
            colonial rule. The medieval theorists who had defined jihad as 
            expansionist war were, according to this view, simply misguided.</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>The second approach, the modernist, also 
            diminishes jihad's military aspects and emphasizes its broader 
            ethical dimensions within Islamic faith and practice. Like the 
            apologists, the modernists dismiss the medieval theory as a 
            distortion of Qur'anic ethics, pointing out, for example, that the 
            division of the world into <I>Dar al-Islam</I> and <I>Dar 
            al-Harb</I> is found nowhere in the Qur'an or Prophetic traditions. 
            A war is jihad, therefore, only if it is fought in defense of Muslim 
            lives, property, and honor. Unlike the apologists, however, the 
            modernists are motivated less by Western criticisms of jihad than by 
            the desire to interpret this concept in a way compatible with modern 
            international norms. Jihad in the modernist view is the Islamic 
            equivalent of the Western idea of just war, a war fought to repel 
            aggression with limited goals and by restricted means.</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>The third approach, the revivalist, 
            arose in response to the apologist and modernist writings. By 
            limiting jihad to self-defense, the revivalists claim, the 
            apologists and modernists have debased the dynamic qualities of 
            jihad. In the final years of the Prophet's life, the revivalists 
            argue, jihad clearly meant the struggle to propagate the Islamic 
            order worldwide. The goal of jihad today ought not to be to coerce 
            people to accept Islam, because the Qur'an clearly encourages 
            freedom of worship (especially 2:256); rather, it ought to be to 
            overthrow un-Islamic regimes that corrupt their societies and divert 
            people from service to God.</P>
            <P class=text-leftjustified>For revivalist writers, un-Islamic 
            regimes include those ruling in most Muslim countries. The immediate 
            goal of the revivalist jihad is to replace hypocritical leaders with 
            true Muslims. Only when this long and painstaking internal struggle 
            has succeeded in reestablishing an authentically Islamic base can 
            the external jihad resume. Thus jihad is today largely synonymous 
            with Islamic revolution in the works of most Muslim activists.</P>
