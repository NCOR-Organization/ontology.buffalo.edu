            <P>The Enemy Is Not Islam. It Is Nihilism <BR>Why everything is at 
            stake. <BR>by Charles Krauthammer 
            <P>EUROPE'S GREAT RELIGIOUS WARS ended in 1648. Three and a half 
            centuries is a long time, too long for us in the West to truly 
            believe that people still slaughter others to vindicate the faith. 
            <P>Thus in the face of radical Islamic terrorism that murders 6,000 
            innocents in a day, we find it almost impossible to accept at face 
            value the reason offered by the murderers. Yet Osama bin Laden could 
            not be clearer. Jihad has been declared against the infidel, whose 
            power and influence thwart the triumph of Islam, and whose success 
            and example--indeed, whose very existence--are an affront to the 
            true faith. As a leader of Hamas declared at a rally three days 
            after the World Trade Center attack, "the only solution is for Bush 
            to convert to Islam." 
            <P>To Americans, who are taught religious tolerance from the cradle, 
            who visit each other's churches for interdenominational succor and 
            solidarity, this seems simply bizarre. On September 25, bin Laden 
            issues a warning to his people that Bush is coming "under the banner 
            of the cross." Two weeks later, in his pre-taped post-attack video, 
            he scorns Bush as "head of the infidels." 
            <P>Can he be serious? This idea is so alien that our learned 
            commentators, Western and secular, have gone rummaging through their 
            ideological attics to find more familiar terms to explain why we 
            were so savagely attacked: poverty and destitution in the Islamic 
            world; grievances against the West, America, Israel; the "wretched 
            of the earth"--Frantz Fanon's 1960s apotheosis of 
            anti-colonialism--rising against their oppressors. 
            <P>Reading conventional notions of class struggle and 
            anti-colonialism into bin Laden, the Taliban, and radical Islam is 
            not just solipsistic. It is nonsense. If poverty and destitution, 
            colonialism and capitalism are animating radical Islam, explain 
            this: In March, the Taliban went to the Afghan desert where stood 
            great monuments of human culture, two massive Buddhas carved out of 
            a cliff. At first, Taliban soldiers tried artillery. The 
            1,500-year-old masterpieces proved too hardy. The Taliban had to 
            resort to dynamite. They blew the statues to bits, then slaughtered 
            100 cows in atonement--for having taken so long to finish the job. 
            <P>Buddhism is hardly a representative of the West. It is hardly a 
            cause of poverty and destitution. It is hardly a symbol of 
            colonialism. No. The statues represented two things: an alternative 
            faith and a great work of civilization. To the Taliban, the presence 
            of both was intolerable. 
            <P>The distinguished Indian writer and now Nobel Prize winner V.S. 
            Naipaul, who has chronicled the Islamic world in two books ("Among 
            the Believers" and "Beyond Belief"), recently warned (in a public 
            talk in Melbourne before the World Trade Center attack), "We are 
            within reach of great nihilistic forces that have undone 
            civilization." In places like Afghanistan, "religion has been turned 
            by some into a kind of nihilism, where people wish to destroy 
            themselves and destroy their past and their culture . . . to be 
            pure. They are enraged about the world and they wish to pull it 
            down." This kind of fury and fanaticism is unappeasable. It knows no 
            social, economic, or political solution. "You cannot converge with 
            this [position] because it holds that your life is worthless and 
            your beliefs are criminal and should be extirpated." 
            <P>This insight offers a needed window on the new enemy. It turns 
            out that the enemy does have recognizable analogues in the Western 
            experience. He is, as President Bush averred in his address to the 
            nation, heir to the malignant ideologies of the 20th century. In its 
            nihilism, its will to power, its celebration of blood and death, its 
            craving for the cleansing purity that comes only from eradicating 
            life and culture, radical Islam is heir, above all, to Nazism. The 
            destruction of the World Trade Center was meant not only to wreak 
            terror. Like the smashing of the Bamiyan Buddhas, it was meant to 
            obliterate greatness and beauty, elegance and grace. These artifacts 
            represented civilization embodied in stone or steel. They had to be 
            destroyed. 
            <P>This worship of death and destruction is a nihilism of a ferocity 
            unlike any since the Nazis burned books, then art, then whole 
            peoples. Goebbels would have marvelled at the recruitment tape for 
            al Qaeda, a two-hour orgy of blood and death: image after image of 
            brutalized Muslims shown in various poses of victimization, followed 
            by glorious images of desecration of the infidel--mutilated American 
            soldiers in Somalia, the destruction of the USS Cole, mangled bodies 
            at the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Throughout, the 
            soundtrack endlessly repeats the refrain "with blood, with blood, 
            with blood." Bin Laden appears on the tape to counsel that "the love 
            of this world is wrong. You should love the other world...die in the 
            right cause and go to the other world." In his October 9 taped 
            message, al Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman abu Ghaith gloried in the 
            "thousands of young people who look forward to death, like the 
            Americans look forward to living." 
            <P>Once again, the world is faced with a transcendent conflict 
            between those who love life and those who love death both for 
            themselves and their enemies. Which is why we tremble. Upon 
            witnessing the first atomic bomb explode at the Trinity site at 
            Alamogordo, J. Robert Oppenheimer recited a verse from the Hindu 
            scripture "Bhagavad Gita": "Now I am become death, the destroyer of 
            worlds." We tremble because for the first time in history, nihilism 
            will soon be armed with the ultimate weapons of annihilation. For 
            the first time in history, the nihilist will have the means to match 
            his ends. Which is why the war declared upon us on September 11 is 
            the most urgent not only of our lives, but in the life of 
            civilization itself.
