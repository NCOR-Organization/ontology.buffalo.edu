      <H1>God and Mammon: Does Poverty Cause Militant Islam?<BR><SPAN 
      class=subtitle>The National Interest<BR>Winter 2002</SPAN></H1>
      <P>The events of September 11 have intensified a long-standing debate: 
      What causes Muslims to turn to militant Islam? Some analysts have noted 
      the poverty of Afghanistan and concluded that herein lay the problem. 
      Jessica Stern of Harvard University wrote that the United States "can no 
      longer afford to allow states to fail." If it does not devote a much 
      higher priority to health, education and economic development abroad, she 
      writes, "new Osamas will continue to arise." Susan Sachs of the New York 
      Times observes: "Predictably, the disappointed youth of Egypt and Saudi 
      Arabia turn to religion for comfort." More colorfully, others have 
      advocated bombarding Afghanistan with foodstuffs not along with but 
      instead of explosives.<BR><BR>Behind these analyses lies an assumption 
      that socioeconomic distress drives Muslims to extremism. The evidence, 
      however, does not support this expectation. Militant Islam (or Islamism) 
      is not a response to poverty or impoverishment; not only are Bangladesh 
      and Iraq not hotbeds of militant Islam, but militant Islam has often 
      surged in countries experiencing rapid economic growth. The factors that 
      cause militant Islam to decline or flourish appear to have more to do with 
      issues of identity than with economics.<BR><BR><B>All Other Problems 
      Vanish</B><BR><BR>The conventional wisdom-that economic stress causes 
      militant Islam and that economic growth is needed to blunt it-has many 
      well-placed adherents. Even some Islamists themselves accept this 
      connection. In the words of a fiery sheikh from Cairo, "Islam is the 
      religion of bad times." A Hamas leader in Gaza, Mahmud az-Zahar, says, "It 
      is enough to see the poverty-stricken outskirts of Algiers or the refugee 
      camps in Gaza to understand the factors that nurture the strength of the 
      Islamic Resistance Movement." In this spirit, militant Islamic 
      organizations offer a wide range of welfare benefits in an effort to 
      attract followers. They also promote what they call an "Islamic economy" 
      as the "most gracious system of solidarity in a society. Under such a 
      system, the honorable do not fall, the honest do not perish, the needy do 
      not suffer, the handicapped do not despair, the sick do not die for lack 
      of care, and people do not destroy one another."<BR><BR>Many secular 
      Muslims also stress militant Islam's source in poverty as an article of 
      faith. Süleyman Demirel, the former Turkish president, says, "As long as 
      there is poverty, inequality, injustice, and repressive political systems, 
      fundamentalist tendencies will grow in the world." Turkey's former prime 
      minister, Tansu Çiller, finds that Islamists did so well in the 1994 
      elections because "People reacted to the economy." The chief of Jordanian 
      Army Intelligence holds, "Economic development may solve almost all of our 
      problems [in the Middle East]." Including militant Islam, he was asked? 
      Yes, he replied: "The moment a person is in a good economic position, has 
      a job, and can support his family, all other problems 
      vanish."<BR><BR>Leftists in the Middle East concur, interpreting the 
      militant Islamic resurgence as "a sign of pessimism. Because people are 
      desperate, they are resorting to the supernatural." Social scientists sign 
      on as well: Hooshang Amirahmadi, an academic of Iranian origins, argues 
      that "the roots of Islamic radicalism must be looked for outside the 
      religion, in the real world of cultural despair, economic decline, 
      political oppression, and spiritual turmoil in which most Muslims find 
      themselves today." The academy, with its lingering Marxist disposition and 
      disdain for faith, of course accepts this militant Islam-from-poverty 
      thesis with near unanimity. Ervand Abrahamian holds that "the behavior of 
      Khomeini and the Islamic Republic has been determined less by scriptural 
      principles than by immediate political, social and economic needs." Ziad 
      Abu-Amr, author of a book on militant Islam (and a member of the Palestine 
      Legislative Council), ascribes a Palestinian turn toward religiosity to 
      "the sombre climate of destruction, war, unemployment, and depression 
      [which] cause people to seek solace, and they're going to 
      Allah."<BR><BR>Western politicians also find the argument compelling. For 
      former President Bill Clinton, "These forces of reaction feed on 
      disillusionment, poverty and despair", and he advocates a socioeconomic 
      remedy: "spread prosperity and security to all." Edward Djerejian, once a 
      top State Department figure, reports that "political Islamic movements are 
      to an important degree rooted in worsening socio-economic conditions in 
      individual countries." Martin Indyk, another former high-ranking U.S. 
      diplomat, warns that those wishing to reduce the appeal of militant Islam 
      must first solve the economic, social and political problems that 
      constitute its breeding grounds.<BR><BR>Militant Islam reflects "the 
      economic, political, and cultural disappointment" of Muslims, according to 
      former German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Former Interior Minister 
      Charles Pasqua of France finds that this phenomenon "has coincided with 
      despair on the part of a large section of the masses, and young people in 
      particular." Prime Minister Eddie Fenech of Malta draws an even closer 
      tie: "Fundamentalism grows at the same pace as economic problems." 
      Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres flatly asserts that 
      "fundamentalism's basis is poverty" and that it offers "a way of 
      protesting against poverty, corruption, ignorance, and 
      discrimination."<BR><BR>Armed with this theory of cause and effect, 
      businessmen on occasion make investments with an eye to political 
      amelioration. The Virgin Group's chairman, Richard Branson, declared as he 
      opened a music store in Beirut: "The region will become stable if people 
      invest in it, create jobs and rebuild the countries that need rebuilding, 
      not ignore them."<BR><BR><B>Somewhere Near the Stratosphere</B><BR><BR>But 
      the empirical record evinces little correlation between economics and 
      militant Islam. Aggregate measures of wealth and economic trends fall flat 
      as predictors of where militant Islam will be strong and where not. On the 
      level of individuals, too, conventional wisdom points to militant Islam 
      attracting the poor, the alienated and the marginal-but research finds 
      precisely the opposite to be true. To the extent that economic factors 
      explain who becomes Islamist, they point to the fairly well off, not the 
      poor.<BR><BR>Take Egypt as a test case. In a 1980 study, the Egyptian 
      social scientist Saad Eddin Ibrahim interviewed Islamists in Egyptian 
      jails and found that the typical member is "young (early twenties), of 
      rural or small-town background, from the middle or lower middle class, 
      with high achievement and motivation, upwardly mobile, with science or 
      engineering education, and from a normally cohesive family." In other 
      words, Ibrahim concluded, these young men were "significantly above the 
      average in their generation"; they were "ideal or model young Egyptians." 
      In a subsequent study, he found that out of 34 members of the violent 
      group At-Takfir w'al-Hijra, fully 21 had fathers in the civil service, 
      nearly all of them middle-ranking. More recently, the Canadian Security 
      Intelligence Service found that the leadership of the militant Islamic 
      group Al-Jihad "is largely university educated with middle-class 
      backgrounds." These are not the children of poverty or 
      despair.<BR><BR>Other researchers confirm these findings for Egypt. In a 
      study on the country's economic troubles, Galal A. Amin, an economist at 
      the American University in Cairo, concludes by noting "how rare it is to 
      find examples of religious fanaticism among either the higher or the very 
      lowest social strata of the Egyptian population." When her assistant in 
      Cairo turned Islamist, the American journalist Geraldine Brooks tells of 
      her surprise: "I'd assumed that the turn to Islam was the desperate choice 
      of poor people searching for heavenly solace. But Sahar [the assistant] 
      was neither desperate nor poor. She belonged somewhere near the 
      stratosphere of Egypt's meticulously tiered society." And note this 
      account by the talented journalist Hamza Hendawi: In Egypt,
      <BLOCKQUOTE>a new breed of preachers in business suits and with cellular 
        phones are attracting increasing numbers of the rich and powerful away 
        from Western lifestyles and into religious conservatism. The modern 
        imams hold their seminars over banquets in some of Cairo's most 
        luxurious homes and in Egypt's seaside resorts to appeal to the 
        wealthy's sense of style and comfort.</BLOCKQUOTE>What is true of Egypt 
      holds equally true elsewhere: Like fascism and Marxism-Leninism in their 
      heydays, militant Islam attracts highly competent, motivated and ambitious 
      individuals. Far from being the laggards of society, they are its leaders. 
      Brooks, a much-traveled journalist, found Islamists to be "the most 
      gifted" of the youth she encountered. Those "hearing the Islamic call 
      included the students with the most options, not just the desperate cases. 
      . . . They were the elites of the next decade: the people who would shape 
      their nations' future."<BR><BR>Even Islamists who make the ultimate 
      sacrifice and give up their lives fit this pattern of financial ease and 
      advanced education. A disproportionate number of terrorists and suicide 
      bombers have higher education, often in engineering and the sciences. This 
      generalization applies equally to the Palestinian suicide bombers 
      attacking Israel and the followers of Osama bin Laden who hijacked the 
      four planes of September 11. In the first case, one researcher found by 
      looking at their profiles that: "Economic circumstances did not seem to be 
      a decisive factor. While none of the 16 subjects could be described as 
      well-off, some were certainly struggling less than others." In the second 
      case, as the Princeton historian Sean Wilentz sardonically put it, the 
      biographies of the September 11 killers would imply that the root cause of 
      terrorism is "money, education and privilege." More generally, Fathi 
      ash-Shiqaqi, founding leader of the arch-murderous Islamic Jihad, once 
      commented, "Some of the young people who have sacrificed themselves [in 
      terrorist operations] came from well-off families and had successful 
      university careers." This makes sense, for suicide bombers who hurl 
      themselves against foreign enemies offer their lives not to protest 
      financial deprivation but to change the world.<BR><BR>Those who back 
      militant Islamic organizations also tend to be well off. They come more 
      often from the richer city than the poorer countryside, a fact that, as 
      Khalid M. Amayreh, a Palestinian journalist, points out, "refutes the 
      widely-held assumption that Islamist popularity thrives on economic 
      misery." And they come not just from the cities but from the upper ranks. 
      At times, an astonishing one-quarter of the membership in Turkey's leading 
      militant Islamic organization, now called the Saadet Party, have been 
      engineers. Indeed, the typical cadre in a militant Islamic party is an 
      engineer in his forties born in a city to parents who had moved from the 
      countryside. Amayreh finds that in the Jordanian parliamentary elections 
      of 1994, the Muslim Brethren did as well in middle-class districts as in 
      poor ones. He generalizes from this that "a substantial majority of 
      Islamists and their supporters come from the middle and upper 
      socio-economic strata."<BR><BR>Martin Kramer, editor of the Middle East 
      Quarterly, goes further and sees militant Islam as
      <BLOCKQUOTE>the vehicle of counter-elites, people who, by virtue of 
        education and/or income, are potential members of the elite, but who for 
        some reason or another get excluded. Their education may lack some 
        crucial prestige-conferring element; the sources of their wealth may be 
        a bit tainted. Or they may just come from the wrong background. So while 
        they are educated and wealthy, they have a grievance: their ambition is 
        blocked, they cannot translate their socio-economic assets into 
        political clout. Islamism is particularly useful to these people, in 
        part because by its careful manipulation, it is possible to recruit a 
        following among the poor, who make valuable foot-soldiers. 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Kramer cites the so-called Anatolian Tigers, businessmen who 
      have had a critical role in backing Turkey's militant Islamic party, as an 
      example of this counter-elite in its purest form.<BR><BR><B>Not a Product 
      of Poverty</B><BR><BR>The same pattern that holds for individual Islamists 
      exists on the level of societies, as well. That social pattern can be 
      expressed by four propositions.<BR><BR>First, wealth does not inoculate 
      against militant Islam. Kuwaitis enjoy a Western-style income (and owe 
      their state's very existence to the West) but Islamists generally win the 
      largest bloc of seats in parliament (at present, twenty out of fifty). The 
      West Bank is more prosperous than Gaza, yet militant Islamic groups 
      usually enjoy more popularity in the former than the latter. Militant 
      Islam flourishes in the member states of the European Union and in North 
      America, where Muslims as a group enjoy a standard of living higher than 
      the national averages. And of those Muslims, as Khalid Durán points out, 
      Islamists have the generally higher incomes: "In the United States, the 
      difference between Islamists and common Muslims is largely one between 
      haves and have-nots. Muslims have the numbers; Islamists have the 
      dollars."<BR><BR>Second, a flourishing economy does not inoculate against 
      radical Islam. Today's militant Islamic movements took off in the 1970s, 
      precisely as oil-exporting states enjoyed extraordinary growth rates. 
      Muammar Qaddafi developed his eccentric version of proto-militant Islam 
      then; fanatical groups in Saudi Arabia violently seized the Great Mosque 
      of Mecca; and Ayatollah Khomeini took power in Iran (though, admittedly, 
      growth had slacked off several years before he overthrew the Shah). In the 
      1980s, several countries that excelled economically experienced a militant 
      Islamic boom. Jordan, Tunisia and Morocco all did well economically in the 
      1990s-as did their militant Islamic movements. Turks under Turgut Özal 
      enjoyed nearly a decade of particularly impressive economic growth even as 
      they joined militant Islamic parties in ever larger numbers.<BR><BR>Third, 
      poverty does not generate militant Islam. There are many very poor Muslim 
      states but few of them have become centers of militant Islam-not 
      Bangladesh, not Yemen, and not Niger. As an American specialist rightly 
      notes, "economic despair, the oft-cited source of political Islam's power, 
      is familiar to the Middle East"; if militant Islam is connected to 
      poverty, why was it not a stronger force in years and centuries past, when 
      the region was poorer than it is today?<BR><BR>Fourth, a declining economy 
      does not generate militant Islam. The 1997 crash in Indonesia and Malaysia 
      did not spur a large turn toward militant Islam. Iranian incomes have gone 
      down by half or more since the Islamic Republic came to power in 1979; 
      yet, far from increasing support for the regime's militant Islamic 
      ideology, impoverishment has caused a massive alienation from Islam. 
      Iraqis have experienced an even more precipitous drop in living standards: 
      Abbas Alnasrawi estimates that per capita income has plummeted by nearly 
      90 percent since 1980, returning it to where it was in the 1940s. While 
      the country has witnessed an increase in personal piety, militant Islam 
      has not surged, nor is it the leading expression of anti-regime 
      sentiments.<BR><BR>Noting these patterns, at least a few observers have 
      drawn the correct conclusion. The outspoken Algerian secularist, Saïd 
      Sadi, flatly rejects the thesis that poverty spurs militant Islam: "I do 
      not adhere to this view that it is widespread unemployment and poverty 
      which produce terrorism." Likewise, Amayreh finds that militant Islam "is 
      not a product or by-product of poverty."<BR><BR><B>Providing a Decent 
      Living</B><BR><BR>If poverty causes militant Islam, broad-based economic 
      growth is the solution. And indeed, in countries as varied as Egypt and 
      Germany, officials argue for a focus on building prosperity and fostering 
      job formation to combat militant Islam. At the height of the crisis in 
      Algeria during the mid-1990s, when the government pled for Western 
      economic aid, it implicitly threatened that without this aid, the 
      Islamists would prevail. This interpretation has practical results: for 
      example, the government in Tunisia has taken some steps toward a free 
      market but has not privatized for fear that the swollen ranks of the 
      unemployed would provide fodder for militant Islamic groups. The same goes 
      for Iran, where Europe and Japan mold policies premised on the notion that 
      their economic ties to the Islamic Republic tame it and discourage 
      military adventurism.<BR><BR>This emphasis on jobs and wealth creation 
      also transformed efforts to end the Arab-Israeli conflict during the Oslo 
      era. Prior to 1993, Israelis had insisted that a resolution would require 
      Arabs to recognize that the Jewish state is a permanent fact of life. 
      Achieving that was thought to lie in winning acceptance of the Jewish 
      state and finding mutually acceptable borders. Then, post-1993, came a 
      major shift: increasing Arab prosperity became the goal, hoping that this 
      would diminish the appeal of militant Islam and other radical ideologies. 
      A jump start for the economy was expected to give Palestinians a stake in 
      the peace process, thereby reducing the appeal of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 
      In this context, Serge Schmemann of the New York Times wrote (without 
      providing evidence) that Arafat "knows that eradicating militancy will 
      ultimately depend more on providing a decent living than on using 
      force."<BR><BR>The Israeli analyst Meron Benvenisti agreed: Islam's 
      "militant character derived from its being an expression of the deep 
      frustration of the underprivileged. . . . Hamas's rise was directly linked 
      to the worsening economic situation and to the accumulated frustration and 
      degradation of the ongoing occupation." Shimon Peres weighed in as well: 
      "Islamic terror cannot be fought militarily but by eradicating the hunger 
      which spawns it." Guided by this theory, the Western states and Israel 
      contributed billions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority. Even more 
      remarkably, the Israeli government fought against efforts by pro-Israel 
      activists in the United States to make U.S. aid to the PLO contingent on 
      Arafat's fulfilling his formal written promises to Israel.<BR><BR>At this 
      late date, one hardly needs to point out the falsehood of Oslo's 
      assumptions. Wealth does not resolve hatreds; a prosperous enemy may 
      simply be one more capable of making war. Westerners and Israelis assumed 
      that Palestinians would make broad economic growth their priority, whereas 
      this has been a minor concern. What has counted instead are questions of 
      identity and power, but so strong is the belief in the militant 
      Islam-from-poverty thesis that Oslo's failure has not managed to discredit 
      the faith in the political benefits of prosperity. Thus, in August 2001, a 
      senior Israeli officer endorsed the building of a power station in 
      northern Gaza on the grounds that it would supply jobs, "and every 
      [Palestinian] working is one less pair of hands for Hamas."<BR><BR><B>A 
      Different Argument</B><BR><BR>If poverty is not the driving force behind 
      militant Islam, several policy implications follow. First, prosperity 
      cannot be looked to as the solution to militant Islam and foreign aid 
      cannot serve as the outside world's main tool to combat it. Second, 
      Westernization also does not a provide a solution. To the contrary, many 
      outstanding militant Islamic leaders are not just familiar with Western 
      ways but are expert in them. In particular, a disproportionate number of 
      them have advanced degrees in technology and the sciences. It sometimes 
      seems that Westernization is a route to hating the West. Third, economic 
      growth does not inevitably lead to improved relations with Muslim states. 
      In some cases (for example, Algeria), it might help; in others (Saudi 
      Arabia), it might hurt.<BR><BR>Could it be, quite contrarily, that 
      militant Islam results from wealth rather than poverty? It is possible. 
      There is, after all, the universal phenomenon that people become more 
      engaged ideologically and active politically only when they have reached a 
      fairly high standard of living. Revolutions take place, it has often been 
      noted, only when a substantial middle class exists. Birthe Hansen, an 
      associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, hints at this when 
      she writes that "the spread of free market capitalism and liberal 
      democracy . . . is probably an important factor behind the rise of 
      political Islam."<BR><BR>Moreover, there is a specifically Islamic 
      phenomenon of the faith having been associated with worldly success. 
      Through history, from the Prophet Muhammad's time to the Ottoman Empire a 
      millennium later, Muslims usually had more wealth and more power than 
      other peoples, and were more literate and healthy. With time, Islamic 
      faith came to be associated with worldly well-being-a kind of Muslim 
      Calvinism, in effect. This connection appears still to hold. For example, 
      as noted in the formulation known as Issawi's law ("Where there are 
      Muslims, there is oil; the converse is not true"), the 1970s oil boom 
      mainly benefited Muslims; it is probably no coincidence that the current 
      wave of militant Islam began then. Seeing themselves as "pioneers of a 
      movement that is an alternative to Western civilization", Islamists need a 
      strong economic base. As Galal Amin writes, "There may be a strong 
      relationship between the growth of incomes that have the nature of 
      economic rent and the growth of religious fanaticism."<BR><BR>Conversely, 
      poor Muslims have tended to be more impressed by alternative affiliations. 
      Over the centuries, for example, apostasy from the religion has mostly 
      occurred when things have gone badly. That was the case when Tatars fell 
      under Russian rule or when Sunni Lebanese lost power to the Maronites. It 
      was also the case in 1995 in Iraqi Kurdistan, a region under double 
      embargo and suffering from civil war:<BR><BR>Trying to live their lives in 
      the midst of fire and gunpowder, Kurdish villagers have reached the point 
      where they are prepared to give up anything to save themselves from hunger 
      and death. From their perspective, changing their religion to get a visa 
      to the West is becoming an increasingly more important 
      option.<BR><BR>There are, in short, ample reasons for thinking that 
      militant Islam results more from success than from failure.<BR><BR><B>The 
      Elevator to Power</B><BR><BR>That being the likely case, it is probably 
      more fruitful to look less to economics and more to other factors when 
      seeking the sources of militant Islam. While material reasons deeply 
      appeal to Western sensibilities, they offer little guidance in this case. 
      In general, Westerners attribute too many of the Arab world's problems, 
      observes David Wurmser of the American Enterprise Institute, "to specific 
      material issues" such as land and wealth. This usually means a tendency 
      "to belittle belief and strict adherence to principle as genuine and 
      dismiss it as a cynical exploitation of the masses by politicians. As 
      such, Western observers see material issues and leaders, not the spiritual 
      state of the Arab world, as the heart of the problem." Or, in Osama bin 
      Laden's ugly formulation, "Because America worships money, it believes 
      that [other] people think that way too."<BR><BR>Indeed, if one turns away 
      from the commentators on militant Islam and instead listens to the 
      Islamists themselves, it quickly becomes apparent that they rarely talk 
      about prosperity. As Ayatollah Khomeini memorably put it, "We did not 
      create a revolution to lower the price of melon." If anything, they look 
      at the consumer societies of the West with distaste. Wajdi Ghunayim, an 
      Egyptian Islamist, sees it as "the reign of décolleté and moda [fashion]" 
      whose common denominator is an appeal to the bestial instincts of human 
      nature. Economic assets for Islamists represent not the good life but 
      added strength to do battle against the West. Money serves to train cadres 
      and buy weapons, not to buy a bigger house or a late-model car. Wealth is 
      a means, not an end.<BR><BR>Means toward what? Toward power. Islamists 
      care less about material strength than about where they stand in the 
      world. They talk incessantly of this. In a typical statement, 'Ali Akbar 
      Mohtashemi, the leading Iranian hard-liner, predicts that "ultimately 
      Islam will become the supreme power." Similarly, Mustafa Mashhur, an 
      Egyptian Islamist, declares that the slogan "God is Great" will 
      reverberate "until Islam spreads throughout the world." Abdessalam 
      Yassine, a Moroccan Islamist, asserts "We demand power"-and the man 
      standing in his way, the late King Hassan, concluded that for Islamists, 
      Islam is "the elevator to take power." He was right. By reducing the 
      economic dimension to its proper proportions, and appreciating the 
      religious, cultural and political dimensions, we may actually begin to 
      understand what causes militant Islam.
