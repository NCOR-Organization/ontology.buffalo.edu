<H1><B>REASON AND FLEXIBILITY IN ISLAM: A 12TH CENTURY 
PERSPECTIVE</B></H1></CENTER>

<P> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>
<H3>I. <U>Introduction</U></H3>
<P><BR>The role of reason, and its embodiment in philosophical-scientific 
theorizing, is always a troubling one for religious traditions. The deep 
emotional needs that religion strives to satisfy seem ever linked to an 
attitudes of acceptance, belief, or trust, yet, in its theoretical employment, 
reason functions as a critic as much as it does a creator, and in the special 
fields of metaphysics and epistemology its critical arrows are sometimes aimed 
at long-standing cherished beliefs. Understandably, the mere approach to these 
beliefs through organized philosophical activity, however well-intended, is 
viewed with suspicion by ecclesiastical authorities and the devout. 
<P>The attitude towards philosophical inquiry on the part of the Islamic 
religious community might be thought to typify this reaction. As one of the 
great prophetic relgions, the self-avowed image of Islam is of a tradition which 
already possesses the truth as set forth in the divine revelation of the 
<U>Qur'an</U>. What need is there for philosophizing on fundamental matters, 
e.g., the ultimate nature of reality, the foundations of morality, the modes 
whereby the divine is connected with the temporal? The structure of creation is 
already made clear, the "straight path" for living already manifest. how can 
philosophical activity be anything but a source of divisive controversy, for as 
it turns its gaze to the foundations upon which the <U>Shari`a</U> (Islamic Law) 
rests, or to the grounds for religious belief itself, it cannot avoid turning up 
alternative viewpoints, different perspectives on divine revelation, noting 
various weaknesses in received interpretations? In short, isn't the practice of 
philosophy a threat to Islam's promise of providing a comprehensive way of 
living devoid of skepticism and uncertainty about the place of a human in God's 
creation and his or her role in the '<U>umma</U> (Islamic community)? 
<P>This problem is not unique to Islam, nor is it a new one within Islam. We 
know that it has been debated by Islamic thinkers since the translations of the 
Greek philosophers began to appear in an organized Islamic world during the 8th 
Century A. D. At times, when the presumed defenders of tradition came to view 
Greek-inspired philosophical speculation as heresy, the debate became 
vociferous. But nothing was settled at that time, and there are at least three 
reasons why the problem continues to be pressing one for the Islam, indeed, for 
the future of Islamic Civilization. <U>First</U>, Islam offers a 
<U>comprehensive</U> way of life; it offers a guide for the conduct of all the 
fundamental ascpects to human life, through which a truly human existence can be 
achieved. There is no separation of religious concern and guidance from any 
other human activity, no boundary where the influence of relgion is allowed to 
cease and other concerns and directives take over. In particular, the 
<U>Shari`a</U> allows no challenges its authority in matters of politics, 
economics, morality and education, and the very flow of information is to remain 
under its watchful eye. 
<P><U>Second</U>, not only is the <U>Qur'an</U>, the very foundation of the 
<U>Shari`a</U>, a holy book, it is the direct and immediate word of God. There 
can be no question of whether these words issued from God; they <U>did</U>, and 
there's an end to it. Therefore, any challenge to these words, any doubt about 
their truth, is absolutely unacceptable. Those who offer it, have stepped 
outside the bounds of Islam, have refused to carry on dialogue within the sacred 
tradition, and, for these reasons, are wholly discredited. 
<P>The <U>third</U> reason is more concretely related to current times. The 
Islamic Civilization is currently facing a severe challenge from a vigorous 
West. Relations between the two have never been smooth, in fact, to both the the 
Western and Islamic mind, the direct contacts have often been hostile and 
bitter, while relations in times of peace uneasy. The challenge is most 
obviously felt in its political, economic, and military dimensions, with control 
of territory and resources at stake. But it takes other forms. At present, there 
is an increasing encroachment of Western attitudes, values, life-styles, and 
world-views within the Islamic community, causing great alarm among those who 
find their identity in Islam. Hence, many Muslims have adopted a defensive 
posture, with all the conservative intolerance that it tends to bring. This 
bodes ill for philosophical speculation, especially that which has been nutured 
within the texts and traditions of the West. And yet, others, equally concerned 
about the fate of the Islamic world, doubt that this rigid reactionism is the 
correct approach, and urge a more flexible stance that permits adjustment in 
established ways of life and thought yet within the Islamic framework. Between 
these two groups, the battle over the place of reason and philosophical thought 
<U>within</U> the Islamic context is waged anew. 
<P>I said that the basic problem is not a new one for Islam. Let us step back 
into history and learn how one Islamic philosopher, Ibn Rushd (Averroes) dealt 
with it. Perhaps his solution is a relevant one for Muslims in today's 
increasingly difficult world. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>II. <U>The Argument of the "Decisive Treatise"</U></H3>
<P><BR>The Andalusian philosopher Ibn Rushd (1126-1198 A.D.) wrote at a time in 
which the status of philosophy was in dispute in the Islamic world. During the 
10th and 11th Centuries Islamic thought had reached a high degree of 
sophistication in the works of Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, and Ibn Sina (Avicenna). 
These philosophers borrowed heavily from Greek thought, and the metaphysical 
framework within which they work was Neo-Platonist. In the work of Ibn Sina, 
perhaps, Neo-Platonist themes reached their highest stage of development. 
<P>This work was not always well received, and opposition soon emerged. This 
opposition echoed earlier disputes among the <U>Mutikallimun</U> (theologians) 
on the topics of divine nature, for it was the use of Greek logical categories 
by the <U>Mu`tazila</U> that result in a perceived threat to the doctrine of 
divine omnipotence and, consequently, led to reaction among more 
traditionally-minded thinkers. An extreme reaction set in among certain schools 
of Islamic jurisprudence, particularly the followers of Malik ibn Anas (d. 795) 
and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855). The strict Literalists among the latter, always 
concerned to have a univocal grounding of the <U>Shari`a</U> in textual 
authority, pointed to the dangers of rational inquiry into divine nature. Malik, 
for example, is said to have commented on the <U>Qur'an</U>'s reference to God's 
"sitting on the throne" (<U>Qur'an</U> 7,54 and 20,5) in this way: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The sitting is known, its modality is unknown. Belief in it is an 
  obligation and raising questions regarding it is a heresy."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>A more well-received reaction among philosophically-minded theologians, 
however, was that of the <U>Ash`arite</U> school of theology, who countered the 
<U>Mu`tazila</U> by using the same rational techniques to defend the absolute 
omnipotence of the divine being. 
<P>But it was after this first flurries of this controversy had died down that 
Al-Farabi (873-950) and Ibn Sina (980-1037) produced their systematic 
Neo-Platonist metaphysics in which the interpretation of God as the ONE, was 
given its most rigorous and refined development. Here Islamic philosophy 
delivered a vision of divine reality and creation which seemed a considerable 
leap from the descriptions of God in the <U>Qur'an</U>. It is not surprising 
that such work would generate yet another <U>Ash`arite</U> reaction, expressed 
this time in the work of Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) the greatest philosophical 
critic of Islamic Neo-Platonism. His work <U>The Incoherence of the 
Philosophers</U> was a full-scaled attack on several Neo-Platonist theses, and 
its warm reception effectively meant the end of Neo-Platonism within the Islamic 
context. 
<P>The battle was being waged anew in Andalusia as Ibn Rushd matured 
intellectually. Then, at a time when philosophical speculation was favored among 
the reigning powers, he wrote a detailed reply to Al-Ghazali entitled <U>The 
Incoherence of the Incoherence</U> in which he partly defended Al-Farabi and Ibn 
Sina and partly developed his own Aristotelian version of neo-Platonism. During 
this period, he also wrote the <U>Decisive Treatise on the Harmony between 
Philosophy and Religious Law (Shari`a)</U>, which is our concern here. 
<P>The treatise begins with the question already posed: what is the attitude of 
the <U>Shari`a</U> (divine wisdom) towards philosophy (science, human wisdom)? 
Specifically, is philosophical study forbidden, discouraged, permitted 
recommended, or obligatory according to <U>Shari`a</U>? One might wonder why 
this question should be thought significant enough for an entire treatise; why 
not settle it straightaway in a single paragraph pending a direct examination of 
the text of the <U>Qur'an</U>? The problem is that the <U>Qur'an</U> doesn't 
address the subject in exactly these terms. One might conclude that it leaves 
the matter open, hence, that it <U>permits</U> philosophical inquiry. But, of 
course, this answer would not satisfy the literalists who were mindful of the 
<U>Qur'anic</U> injunction to believe and its self-proclaimed inerrancy. They 
opposed philosophy as a dangerous innovation, and mindful of them, it is not 
enough for Ibn Rushd to build a case for the study of philosophy outside of the 
<U>Shari`a</U>, or even outside the <U>Qur'an</U>. Instead, he sought an 
explicit sanction for philosophical thought within the divine text. 
<P>He begins in the strongest possible way. If the study of philosophy is 
nothing more than "the study of existing beings and reflection on them as 
indications of the Creator," he writes, then it is clear that this study is 
either obligatory or recommended by the <U>Shari`a</U>. How so? Here Ibn Rushd 
quotes several passages from the <U>Qur'an</U> including, "Reflect, you have 
vision" (59,2); "Have they not studied the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, 
and whatever things God has created?" (7,185); and "Do they not observe the 
camels, how they have been created, and the sky, how it has been raised up?" 
(88, 17-18). He thinks it is indisputable that such texts call for the "study of 
beings by the intellect and reflection on them." Of course, such reflection 
requires the use of <U>reasoning</U> and the drawing of inferences to determine 
what is actually implied by the explicit prouncements over the subject-matter in 
question, presumably, in the best way that we can. In order to do this, i.e., to 
use our reasoning effectively, we must study the conditions of valid inference 
and how the best type of reasoning, namely, demonstrative reasoning, differs 
from the lesser forms of rhetorical and sophistical reasoning. But then we must 
engage in the study of logic, including an examination of the best texts written 
on the subject, e.g., those of Aristotle, and as Aristotelian logic blends into 
Aristotelian metaphysics and epistemology, it follows that one must study the 
traditional branches of philosophy in order to carry out the <U>Qur'an</U>'s 
injunctions. Of course, the study of metaphysics is sanctioned anyway, for how 
else can we understand the relations of Creator to created -- upon which we are 
instructed to reflect -- if not in terms of metaphysical categories? 
<P>Now, on the surface, this is an very bold, if not incredible, piece of 
reasoning. How can Ibn Rushd offer it so quickly and expect acceptance? 
Sensitive to this concern, he sought to buttress his remarks by independent 
arguments. What is critical for the happiness of <U>any</U> human being, he 
wrote, is <U>assent</U> to God's creation and to the truth of divine revelation. 
Assent is the product of reflection, and for different types of human beings 
different modes of reflection are appropriate. The <U>Shari`a</U> summons each 
person to assent in a manner appropriate to him or her. For those in the 
intellectual class, in particular, demonstrative reasoning is the proper 
modality of assent since lesser forms of reasoning will not be sufficient -- 
hence they are referred to as the "demonstrative class." It is precisely for the 
purpose of engendering assent, then, that the <U>Qur'an</U> encourages 
reflection among the demonstrative class of persons, so that they might "see" 
and understand how the multiplicity of beings is, indeed, a product of divine 
creation.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/IBNRU.html#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP> 
<P>Now a problem arises. There is only one Truth, and there are are no 
contradictions within it. The <U>Shari`a</U> is true, but so are the discoveries 
of philosophy. Are there not cases in which the two conflict? What happens when 
they do? How can the unity of Truth be maintained? Consider the <U>Qur'an</U>'s 
descriptions of God's "sitting upon" his throne, or of God's possessing a 
"hand." At face value, these commit us to saying that God is bodily, hence 
material. Yet philosophy teaches that all bodies, particularly living bodies 
with hands, are temporally finite and doomed to decay. Moreover, philosophy 
shows that God must be a purely spiritual substance in order to possess the 
infinite attributes of omnipotence, omniscience and the like that the 
<U>Qur'an</U> ascribes. How do we deal with the conflict before us? 
<P>Ibn Rushd's answer is familiar. The conflict is only apparent; we must 
understand that some texts in the <U>Qur'an</U> cannot be taken literally, that 
is, taken in their apparent meaning (<U>zaher</U> <U>an-nutq</U>) but, instead, 
require interpretation (<U>ta'wil</U>). If they require interpretation then they 
must possess a hidden meaning (<U>baten</U> <U>an-nutq</U>) in addition to their 
apparent meaning, and it is only when we engage in interpretation that we can 
discern their hidden meanings and, thereby, preserve the unity between 
<U>Shari`a</U> and philosophy. Such passages are to be viewed as metaphorical or 
allegorical. Ibn Rushd appeals to the <U>Qur'an</U> itself in justification of 
the idea that the texts must contain hidden meanings and not every statement in 
it can be taken literally. In the third Sura of the <U>Qur'an</U>, verse 7, 
there is a reference to ambiguous verses in contrast to clear and unambiguous 
verses. Ibn Rushd also cites the <U>Sunnah</U> (traditions) as sanctioning 
interpretation. 
<P>The passage at <U>Qur'an</U> 3,7 is particularly crucial. There we are 
informed that while certain verses are clear and unambiguous (<U>ayat</U> 
<U>muhkamat</U>) others are ambiguous or obscure (<U>ayat</U> 
<U>mutashabihat</U>). The latter are metaphorical and, consequently, have a 
hidden meaning. But who is qualified to do the intepreting? Indeed, who knows or 
has access to the hidden meanings? In that very verse reference it is made clear 
that <U>not</U> everyone knows the interpretation, though certainly God does, 
and perhaps also, those who are "well-grounded in learning." Here is a serious 
controversy. In one reading of verse 7, only God is said to know the 
intepretation, whereas in the other reading, both God <U>and</U> those who are 
well-grounded in learning (<U>rasikhun</U> <U>fil-'ilm</U>) know the 
interpretation. That is, the very verse in which the clear/ambiguous distinction 
is drawn is itself is ambiguous! The ambiguity is syntactical, and to fix the 
alternative readings requires close analysis of the Arabic text. While the 
syntatical ambiguity can be approximated in English, it cannot be captured 
exactly because English lacks the Arabic system of verbal inflection. Here is 
one way to bring out the ambiguity: <BR>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He it is who has sent down to thee the Book; in it are verses 
  basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the 
  Book; others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow 
  the part thereof that is allegorical; seeking discord, and searching for its 
  hidden meanings. And no one knows its hidden meanings except God and those who 
  are firmly grounded in knowledge they say: "We believe in it, the whole of it 
  is from our Lord:" and none will grasp the message except men of 
understanding.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>What are we to make of the ambiguity of "And no one knows its hidden 
meanings except God and those who are firmly grounded in knowledge they say"? 
Most contemporary readers of the <U>Qur'an</U> will deny that there is any 
ambiguity, since the text possesses a disambiguating device, a punctuation mark, 
a <I>waqfa lazim, </I>which is placed after the occurrence of 'God' and 
indicates a stopping point or pause. With it, the passage naturally receives 
this paraphrase: ". . . none know the interpretation except God, and those who 
are firmly grounded in knowledge say . . ."&nbsp; Now the <I>waqfa lazim</I> is 
not a full stop which marks the end of a sentence; but it is used to indicate a 
pause in the actual processing of the information, particularly in reading. 
Noting that the <U>Qur'an</U> was, and still is, a text designed for recitation, 
such a mark is vital in determining how the phrasing should go. So interpreted, 
the pause after 'God' suggests that only God knows the intepretation, and those 
who are firmly-grounded in knowledge agree with <U>that</U>, saying "we believe 
in it . . ." But Ibn Rushd disputes this reading and pointedly asserts that this 
is <U>not</U> where the pause belongs but, rather, after the phrase 
'firmly-grounded in knowledge,' in which case the passage should be read as ". . 
. none know their intepretation except God and those who are firmly grounded in 
knowledge; they say, "we believe in it . . ."" 
<P>What are we to make of this?&nbsp; Is Ibn Rushd suggesting that we alter the 
sacred text itself? Plainly not. He is well aware that the insertion of these 
punctuation marks came relatively late in the canonization of the text of the 
<U>Qur'an</U>. Whereas the actual words comprising the text were settled upon in 
the mid 7th Century A.D., there emerged alternative <U>readings</U> of the 
verses (at least seven such). One particular reading came to be favored by the 
9th Century, and the pauses such as that in 3,7 were canonized at that 
point.&nbsp; However, there was a significant minority of commentators on the 
text&nbsp; who disputed this reading, in particular, the commentator Ibn 
Mujahid, who urged that stop comes after "those who are firmly grounded in 
knowledge" as it is in the reading of Ibn Mas'ud.&nbsp; Ibn Rushd favored this 
reading, and in so doing entered into the exegetical debate that already existed 
in <U>Qur'anic</U> exegsis (<U>tafsir</U>). 
<P>A few points can be raised on his behalf here. First, if we did not allow 
interpetation, we would be at a loss to explain why ambiguous verses even appear 
in God's revelation -- what is their purpose? If only God can understand their 
meanings what function can they possibly serve in setting forth the straight 
path. Why should the book designed to reveal the straight path contain 
statements which no human can possibly understand and profit from? Second, 
without allowing those well grounded in learning to interpret we would then be 
hard-pressed to explain other passages in the <U>Qur'an</U>, for example, 6,98 
and 6,105, where it is said that signs are given to those who know. Third, Ibn 
Rushd is convinced that Islam is for everyone, regardless of their intellectual 
capacity. Everyone must assent. The simple-minded folk who have no time or 
opportunity for intellectual disputes take the images and stories at face value. 
It is they who must simply believe and not question; they are not capable of 
grasping the hidden meaning.&nbsp; For this reason, they must not be permitted 
to interpret sacred text (and on this point Ibn Rush is emphatic, citing both 
the <U>Qur'an</U> and the <U>Sunnah</U> in support). Others can be told that 
there is a hidden meaning of certain texts, but that the meaning is not for them 
to know. They too must believe and not seek further. Otherwise they would cause 
dissension within Islam by spawning rival interpretations.&nbsp; Only those of 
the demonstrative class are permitted to engage in interpretation. If this were 
not allowed, they could not possibly assent, and they, their commitment, and 
their services would be lost to Islam. Therefore, interpretation must be allowed 
to them in order that they will continue to qualify for membership in the 
Islamic community and that their services retained. And if interpretation is to 
be allowed, so must philosophical investigation be allowed. <BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>III. <U>The Relevance of Ibn Rushd's argument to contemporary 
Islam</U></H3>Let us briefly apply the message of Ibn Rushd to the contemporary 
dliemma facing the Islamic world. Dramatize it in the strongest possible terms: 
Islamic Civilization is facing a challenge from Western Civilization, a 
challenge from a civilization which is currently more powerful (militarily, 
economically, and politically), and which constitutes a threat to its own 
survival. Given this challenge, Islamic civilization faces at least these 
alternatives for response; (1) absolute submission to the West, overt 
acknowledgment of Western hegemony and values, and the adoption of Western modes 
of belief and behavior; (2) passive withdrawal and an avoidance of outright 
conflict, that is, inwardly refusing to submit to Western ways, yet offering no 
resistance to the current Western economic and political hegemony, patiently 
awaiting its demise; (3) rejection of the West by means direct confrontation and 
adoption of positive measures to curb or expunge its influence; or (4) some type 
of adaptation to, or accommodation of, Western intellectual and spiritual 
influence. 
<P>Anyone who knows the current state of affairs in the contemporary Islamic 
world will rule out alternative (1). Alternative (2) carries with it the risk of 
having Islamic values being overwhelmed, of having Islamic peoples being 
converted to Western ways, first in behavior, then in intellectual matters, then 
in religious commitment. To avoid either (1) and (2), alternative (3) has gained 
increasingly many adherents among Muslims, though it too permits various 
modalities with different outcomes. It involves a refusal to accommodate Western 
ways -- perhaps an outright return to traditional Islamic values, as called for 
by the currently popular Islamic revivalist movement (typified by the late 
Ayatollah Khomeni). But this is a risky venture. The Islamic world is unlikely 
to succeed if it turns to outright isolationism. There will be a continual 
efforts by the West to encroach upon the Islamic domain to insure access to 
Middle Eastern oil or to contain the spread of a hostile Islam, and it is 
doubtful that isolationism will be very popular or even possible. A wholesale 
confrontation, on the other hand, a direct attempt to impose a military defeat 
upon the Western intruders and expell Western influence, seems equally unlikely 
given Western military predominance, at least for the next half-century. A 
prolonged war of attrition, especially with the inevitable clash with Israel, 
would undoubtedly have more a more serious impact on the future of Middle 
Eastern peoples, on Islam itself, than it will upon the West. For the next few 
decades, at least, aggressive confrontation seems a dubious prospect for the 
Islamic world. 
<P>The unlikely prospects for success suggest that Islamic Civilization would 
presently find a safer course in alternative (4), adaptation. But this can occur 
in different ways. In itself, 'adapatation' can mean various things, ranging 
from total submission, to mimicry, to pragmatic defensive strategies. Also, use 
of the term raises questions about <U>what</U> to adapt to, Western hegemony? 
Technology? Values? Life styles? Political structure? World views? Whatever the 
course of action to be favored here, my claim is that the best prospects for the 
survival of Islamic Civilization lie in discovering some mode of accommodation, 
some formula for an adaptation to Western influence while preserving what is 
essentially Islamic. To do so, some intellectual flexibility must be allowed, 
rigid insistence upon traditional formulae relaxed, and philosophical discussion 
allowed free reign, at least within institutions of higher education. If this 
does not happen, Islam is in danger of collapsing under direct pressure from the 
West, perhaps through overwhelming external defeat, or through internal 
dissensions about how to respond. If it attempts to accommodate the Western 
intrusion through pragmatic adaptative measures, including tolerance of new 
ideas representing novel approaches to pressing problems, it must learn to deal 
with the <U>Qur'an</U> and the <U>Sunnah</U> with a mixture of respect and 
adventure. 
<P>The question is whether Islam <U>can</U> adapt? My claim is that it can 
insofar as its approach to the <U>Shari`a</U> is a flexible one, that is, if it 
does not view this a rigidly fixed canon that refuses to tolerate novel efforts 
to secure insightful interpretations. Only then can Islamic world retain its own 
intellectual talent and prevent defection to what might seem to be a more 
vigorous West. On this score, the argument of Ibn Rushd carries a relevance that 
extends far beyond disputes about Medieval metaphysics, <U>Qur'anic</U> 
exegesis, or Arabic grammar. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; </P></BODY></HTML>
