            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Back 
            in the 1930s, when white men were preparing for another round of 
            mutual slaughter, few of them paid any attention to the Muslim 
            world. They assumed it to be a backward region that history had long 
            since passed by. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>One 
            man saw it differently. The great Catholic polemicist Hilaire 
            Belloc, an Englishman of French ancestry, remembered Islam&rsquo;s past 
            and predicted, in his book <I><A 
            href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0895554755/lewrockwell/">The 
            Great Heresies</A></I>, that it would one day challenge the West 
            again. As late as 1683 its armies had threatened to conquer Europe, 
            penetrating all the way to Vienna; </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Belloc believed that a great Islamic revival, even in the 
            twentieth century, was altogether possible. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Belloc saw Islam not as an alien religion, but in its origins 
            as a Christian heresy, adopting and adapting certain Christian 
            doctrines (monotheism, the immortality of the soul, final judgment) 
            and rejecting others (original sin, the Incarnation and divinity of 
            Christ, the sacraments). Its simple, rational creed had a powerful 
            appeal to Arabs who had known only the arbitrary gods of grim pagan 
            religions. It swept the Arab world, then made converts – and 
            conquests – far beyond Arabia. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Islam was a militant religion from the start. Mohammed 
            himself conquered the entire Arabian Peninsula in just a few years. 
            The new faith was torn by violent internal divisions even as it 
            continued to spread. But spread it did, with incredible rapidity. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Christians had good reason to fear Islam, which soon 
            conquered Spain and held it for centuries. But because Islam has 
            little attraction for Christians, the West has generally failed to 
            grasp its appeal for others, its profound and permanent hold on the 
            minds of believers. Unlike the Christian West, the Muslim world has 
            never had crises of faith like the Reformation and the 
            Enlightenment. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Islam is a simple religion, easily understood by ordinary 
            people. Its commandments are rigorous but few. When it conquered, 
            its subjugated people often felt more liberated than enslaved, 
            because it often replaced burdensome old bureaucratic governments 
            with relatively undemanding regimes – and low taxes. As long as its 
            authority was respected, Islamic rule was comparatively libertarian. 
            It offered millions relief from their traditional oppression; for 
            example, no Muslim could be a slave. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" 
            size=3>Belloc distinguishes sharply between Islam and such barbarous 
            conquerors as the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan. The Mongols were 
            purely destructive; they were known for slaughtering whole cities 
            and making huge pyramids of severed heads. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Such 
            savagery was alien to the Muslims. Where they conquered, daily life 
            usually went on much as before and culture thrived. In many respects 
            the Muslim world was far more civilized than Christian Europe for 
            centuries. The West hated and dreaded Islam, but nobody would have 
            thought of calling it backward. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>That 
            contemptuous image came much later, when modern Europe&rsquo;s science, 
            technology, and – above all – weaponry had eclipsed those of the 
            Arabs. We are apt to forget how recently this development occurred; 
            and, as Belloc warned, it is not irreversible. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Man, 
            especially irreligious man, is apt to equate power and progress. 
            Many of those who say America is "the greatest country on earth" 
            really mean only that America has fantastic military might, capable 
            of annihilating any other country – and some of them, at the moment, 
            are in the mood to do some annihilating. To the pious Muslim this 
            attitude seems crass and barbaric. He may conclude from it that the 
            decadent West understands only one thing: force. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>And 
            would he be far wrong? Belloc admitted that the idea of a new Muslim 
            challenge to the West seemed "fantastic," but only because the West 
            was "blinded" by "the immediate past." Taking a longer view, he saw 
            Islam, though inferior in material power, as having a great 
            advantage: its religious faith was still strong, while the West was 
            losing its religion and consequently its morale. He thought it 
            entirely possible that Islam would catch up technologically, while 
            he doubted that the West would undergo a spiritual revival. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Are 
            we seeing the beginning of the fulfillment of Belloc&rsquo;s prophecy? If 
            so, the current uproar over Islamic terrorism may turn out to be a 
            mere superficial symptom of a much larger historical drama. The West 
            is still strong, but it is dying. Islam is still weak, but it is 
            growing. Never mind the terrorists; check the birthrates.
