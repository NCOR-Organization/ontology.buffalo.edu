                  HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE September 11 attack on America was 
                  payback for U.S. imperialism. If only we had not gone around 
                  sticking our noses where they did not belong, perhaps we would 
                  not now be contemplating a crater in lower Manhattan. The 
                  solution is obvious: The United States must become a kinder, 
                  gentler nation, must eschew quixotic missions abroad, must 
                  become, in Pat Buchanan's phrase, "a republic, not an empire." 
                  In fact this analysis is exactly backward: The September 11 
                  attack was a result of insufficient American involvement and 
                  ambition; the solution is to be more expansive in our goals 
                  and more assertive in their implementation. <BR><BR>It has 
                  been said, with the benefit of faulty hindsight, that America 
                  erred in providing the mujahedeen with weapons and training 
                  that some of them now turn against us. But this was amply 
                  justified by the exigencies of the Cold War. The real problem 
                  is that we pulled out of Afghanistan after 1989. In so doing, 
                  the George H.W. Bush administration was following a classic 
                  realpolitik policy. We had gotten involved in this distant 
                  nation to wage a proxy war against the Soviet Union. Once that 
                  larger war was over, we could safely pull out and let the 
                  Afghans resolve their own affairs. And if the consequence was 
                  the rise of the Taliban--homicidal mullahs driven by a hatred 
                  of modernity itself--so what? Who cares who rules this 
                  flyspeck in Central Asia? So said the wise elder statesmen. 
                  The "so what" question has now been answered definitively; the 
                  answer lies in the rubble of the World Trade Center and 
                  Pentagon. <BR><BR>We had better sense when it came to the 
                  Balkans, which could without much difficulty have turned into 
                  another Afghanistan. When Muslim Bosnians rose up against Serb 
                  oppression in the early 1990s, they received support from many 
                  of the same Islamic extremists who also backed the mujahedeen 
                  in Afghanistan. The Muslims of Bosnia are not particularly 
                  fundamentalist--after years of Communist rule, most are not 
                  all that religious--but they might have been seduced by the 
                  siren song of the mullahs if no one else had come to champion 
                  their cause. Luckily, someone else did. NATO and the United 
                  States intervened to stop the fighting in Bosnia, and later in 
                  Kosovo. Employing its leverage, the U.S. government pressured 
                  the Bosnian government into expelling the mujahedeen. Just 
                  last week, NATO and Bosnian police arrested four men in 
                  Sarajevo suspected of links to international terrorist groups. 
                  Some Albanian hotheads next tried to stir up trouble in 
                  Macedonia, but, following the dispatch of a NATO peacekeeping 
                  force, they have now been pressured to lay down their arms. 
                  U.S. imperialism--a liberal and humanitarian imperialism, to 
                  be sure, but imperialism all the same--appears to have paid 
                  off in the Balkans. <BR><BR>The problem is that, while the 
                  Clinton administration eventually did something right in the 
                  Balkans, elsewhere it was scandalously irresolute in the 
                  assertion of U.S. power. By cutting and running from Somalia 
                  after the deaths of 18 U.S. soldiers, Bill Clinton fostered a 
                  widespread impression that we could be chased out of a country 
                  by anyone who managed to kill a few Americans. (Ronald Reagan 
                  did much the same thing by pulling out of Lebanon after the 
                  1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks.) After the attacks 
                  on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, Clinton 
                  sent cruise missiles--not soldiers--to strike a symbolic blow 
                  against bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan and a 
                  pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. Those attacks were indeed 
                  symbolic, though not in the way Clinton intended. They 
                  symbolized not U.S. determination but rather passivity in the 
                  face of terrorism. And this impression was reinforced by the 
                  failure of either Bill Clinton or George W. Bush to retaliate 
                  for the attack on the USS Cole in October 2000, most likely 
                  carried out by Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. All these 
                  displays of weakness emboldened our enemies to commit greater 
                  and more outrageous acts of aggression, much as the failure of 
                  the West to contest Japan's occupation of Manchuria in the 
                  1930s, or Mussolini's incursion into Abyssinia, encouraged the 
                  Axis powers toward more spectacular depravities. <BR><BR>The 
                  problem, in short, has not been excessive American 
                  assertiveness but rather insufficient assertiveness. The 
                  question is whether, having now been attacked, we will act as 
                  a great power should. <BR><BR><BR><BR>IT IS STRIKING--and no 
                  coincidence--that America now faces the prospect of military 
                  action in many of the same lands where generations of British 
                  colonial soldiers went on campaigns. Afghanistan, Sudan, 
                  Libya, Egypt, Arabia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Palestine, Persia, 
                  the Northwest Frontier (Pakistan)--these are all places where, 
                  by the 19th century, ancient imperial authority, whether 
                  Ottoman, Mughal, or Safavid, was crumbling, and Western armies 
                  had to quell the resulting disorder. In Egypt, in 1882, 
                  Lieutenant General Sir Garnet Wolseley put down a nationalist 
                  revolt led by a forerunner of Nasser, Colonel Ahmed Arabi. In 
                  Sudan, in the 1880s, an early-day bin Laden who called himself 
                  the Mahdi (Messiah) rallied the Dervishes for a jihad to 
                  spread fundamentalist Islam to neighboring states. Mahdism was 
                  crushed by Sir Horatio Herbert Kitchener on the battlefield of 
                  Omdurman in 1898. Both Sudan and Egypt remained relatively 
                  quiet thereafter, until Britain finally pulled out after World 
                  War II. <BR><BR>In Afghanistan, the British suffered a serious 
                  setback in 1842 when their forces had to retreat from Kabul 
                  and were massacred--all but Dr. William Brydon, who staggered 
                  into Jalalabad to tell the terrible tale. This British failure 
                  has been much mentioned in recent weeks to support the 
                  proposition that the Afghans are invincible fighters. Less 
                  remembered is the sequel. An army under Major General George 
                  Pollock forced the Khyber Pass, recaptured Kabul, burned down 
                  the Great Bazaar to leave "some lasting mark of the just 
                  retribution of an outraged nation," and then marched back to 
                  India. <BR><BR>Thirty-six years later, in 1878, the British 
                  returned to Afghanistan. The highlight of the Second Afghan 
                  War was Lieutenant General Frederick Roberts's once-famous 
                  march from Kabul to Kandahar. Although the British were always 
                  badly outnumbered, they repeatedly bested larger Afghan 
                  armies. The British did not try to impose a colonial 
                  administration in Kabul, but Afghanistan became in effect a 
                  British protectorate with its foreign policy controlled by the 
                  raj. This arrangement lasted until the Third Afghan War in 
                  1919, when Britain, bled dry by World War I, finally left the 
                  Afghans to their own devices. <BR><BR>Afghanistan and other 
                  troubled lands today cry out for the sort of enlightened 
                  foreign administration once provided by self-confident 
                  Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets. Is imperialism a 
                  dusty relic of a long-gone era? Perhaps. But it's interesting 
                  to note that in the 1990s East Timor, Cambodia, Kosovo, and 
                  Bosnia all became wards of the international community 
                  (Cambodia only temporarily). This precedent could easily be 
                  extended, as suggested by David Rieff, into a formal system of 
                  United Nations mandates modeled on the mandatory territories 
                  sanctioned by the League of Nations in the 1920s. Following 
                  the defeat of the German and Ottoman empires, their colonial 
                  possessions were handed out to the Allied powers, in theory to 
                  prepare their inhabitants for eventual self-rule. (America was 
                  offered its own mandate over Armenia, the Dardanelles, and 
                  Constantinople, but the Senate rejected it along with the 
                  Treaty of Versailles.) This was supposed to be "for the good 
                  of the natives," a phrase that once made progressives snort in 
                  derision, but may be taken more seriously after the left's 
                  conversion (or, rather, reversion) in the 1990s to the cause 
                  of "humanitarian" interventions. <BR><BR>The mealy-mouthed 
                  modern euphemism is "nation-building," but "state building" is 
                  a better description. Building a national consciousness, while 
                  hardly impossible (the British turned a collection of princely 
                  states into modern India), is a long-term task. Building a 
                  working state administration is a more practical short-term 
                  objective that has been achieved by countless colonial 
                  regimes, including the United States in Haiti (1915-1933), the 
                  Dominican Republic (1916-1924), Cuba (1899-1902, 1906-1909), 
                  and the Philippines (1899-1935), to say nothing of the 
                  achievements of generals Lucius Clay in Germany and Douglas 
                  MacArthur in Japan. <BR><BR>Unilateral U.S. rule may no longer 
                  be an option today. But the United States can certainly lead 
                  an international occupation force under U.N. auspices, with 
                  the cooperation of some Muslim nations. This would be a huge 
                  improvement in any number of lands that support or shelter 
                  terrorists. For the sake of simplicity, let's consider two: 
                  Afghanistan and Iraq. <BR><BR>In Afghanistan, as I write, the 
                  Special Forces are said to be hunting Osama bin Laden and his 
                  followers. Let us hope they do not catch him, at least not 
                  alive. It would not be an edifying spectacle to see this 
                  scourge of the infidels--this holy warrior who rejects the 
                  Enlightenment and all its works--asserting a medley of 
                  constitutional rights in a U.S. courtroom, perhaps even in the 
                  federal courthouse located just a short walk from where the 
                  World Trade Center once stood. But whatever happens with bin 
                  Laden, it is clear we cannot leave the Taliban in power. It is 
                  a regime that can bring nothing but grief to its people, its 
                  neighbors, and the United States. <BR><BR>But when we oust the 
                  Taliban, what comes next? Will we repeat our mistake of a 
                  decade ago and leave? What if no responsible government 
                  immediately emerges? What if millions of Afghans are left 
                  starving? Someone would have to step in and help--and don't 
                  bet on the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees getting the job 
                  done. The United States, in cooperation with its allies, would 
                  be left with the responsibility to feed the hungry, tend the 
                  sick, and impose the rule of law. This is what we did for the 
                  defeated peoples of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and it is a 
                  service that we should extend to the oppressed people of 
                  Afghanistan as well. Unlike 19th-century European 
                  colonialists, we would not aim to impose our rule permanently. 
                  Instead, as in Western Germany, Italy, and Japan, occupation 
                  would be a temporary expedient to allow the people to get back 
                  on their feet until a responsible, humane, preferably 
                  democratic, government takes over. <BR><BR>Then there is Iraq. 
                  Saddam Hussein is a despised figure whose people rose up in 
                  rebellion in 1991 when given the opportunity to do so by 
                  American military victories. But the first Bush administration 
                  refused to go to Baghdad, and stood by as Saddam crushed the 
                  Shiite and Kurdish rebellions. As a shameful moment in U.S. 
                  history, the abandonment of these anti-Saddam rebels ranks 
                  right up there with our abandonment of the South Vietnamese in 
                  1975. We now have an opportunity to rectify this historic 
                  mistake. <BR><BR>The debate about whether Saddam Hussein was 
                  implicated in the September 11 attacks misses the point. Who 
                  cares if Saddam was involved in this particular barbarity? He 
                  has been involved in so many barbarities over the years--from 
                  gassing the Kurds to raping the Kuwaitis--that he has already 
                  earned himself a death sentence a thousand times over. But it 
                  is not just a matter of justice to depose Saddam. It is a 
                  matter of self defense: He is currently working to acquire 
                  weapons of mass destruction that he or his confederates will 
                  unleash against America and our allies if given the chance. 
                  <BR><BR>Once Afghanistan has been dealt with, America should 
                  turn its attention to Iraq. It will probably not be possible 
                  to remove Saddam quickly without a U.S. invasion and 
                  occupation--though it will hardly require half a million men, 
                  since Saddam's army is much diminished since the Gulf War, and 
                  we will probably have plenty of help from Iraqis, once they 
                  trust that we intend to finish the job this time. Once we have 
                  deposed Saddam, we can impose an American-led, international 
                  regency in Baghdad, to go along with the one in Kabul. With 
                  American seriousness and credibility thus restored, we will 
                  enjoy fruitful cooperation from the region's many 
                  opportunists, who will show a newfound eagerness to be helpful 
                  in our larger task of rolling up the international terror 
                  network that threatens us. <BR><BR><BR><BR>OVER THE YEARS, 
                  AMERICA HAS EARNED opprobrium in the Arab world for its 
                  realpolitik backing of repressive dictators like Hosni Mubarak 
                  and the Saudi royal family. This could be the chance to right 
                  the scales, to establish the first Arab democracy, and to show 
                  the Arab people that America is as committed to freedom for 
                  them as we were for the people of Eastern Europe. To turn Iraq 
                  into a beacon of hope for the oppressed peoples of the Middle 
                  East: Now that would be a historic war aim. <BR><BR>Is this an 
                  ambitious agenda? Without a doubt. Does America have the 
                  resources to carry it out? Also without a doubt. Does America 
                  have the will? That is an open question. But who, on December 
                  6, 1941, would have expected that in four years' time America 
                  would not only roll back German and Japanese aggression, but 
                  also occupy Tokyo and Berlin and impose liberal democracy 
                  where dictators had long held sway? And fewer American lives 
                  were lost on December 7, 1941, than on September 11, 2001. 
                  <BR><BR>"With respect to the nature of the regime in 
                  Afghanistan, that is not uppermost in our minds right now," 
                  Secretary of State Colin Powell recently said. If not 
                  uppermost, though, it certainly should be on our minds. Long 
                  before British and American armies had returned to the 
                  continent of Europe--even before America had entered the 
                  struggle against Germany and Japan--Winston Churchill and 
                  Franklin Roosevelt met on a battleship in the North Atlantic 
                  to plan the shape of the postwar world. The Atlantic Charter 
                  of August 14, 1941, pledged Britain and America to creating a 
                  liberal world order based on peace and national 
                  self-determination. The leaders of America, and of the West, 
                  should be making similar plans today. <BR><BR>Once they do, 
                  they will see that ambitious goals--such as "regime 
                  change"--are also the most realistic. Occupying Iraq and 
                  Afghanistan will hardly end the "war on terrorism," but it 
                  beats the alternatives. Killing bin Laden is important and 
                  necessary; but it is not enough. New bin Ladens could rise up 
                  to take his place. We must not only wipe out the vipers but 
                  also destroy their nest and do our best to prevent new nests 
                  from being built there again. <BR><BR><BR>Max Boot, editorial
