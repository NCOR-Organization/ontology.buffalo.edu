                  THE WAKE of September 11, what can a psychiatrist contribute 
                  to America's defense? Nothing, of course, to defend the nation 
                  from bombs, but something perhaps to defend it against 
                  confusion--and here America certainly needs help. <BR><BR>At 
                  the University of Pennsylvania, the provost called several 
                  neuroscientists together to consider whether the terrorists 
                  should be viewed as bad or mad: evildoers or sufferers from an 
                  exculpating mental disease. The group reached no conclusion, 
                  but one participant thought "brain images" might give the 
                  answer. <BR><BR>Editorialists argued about whether the 
                  atrocities should be considered acts of war or crimes. The 
                  blame-America-first group wanted the events called crimes and 
                  proposed prosecutions at the Hague. Some even opposed military 
                  retaliation, concerned that it would kill innocent people, 
                  produce martyrs, and generate recruits to the terrorist cause, 
                  along with endless war. <BR><BR>One distinguished Boston 
                  psychiatrist, speaking to anchorman Peter Jennings on ABC, 
                  explained the emotional distress of Americans as castration 
                  anxiety provoked by seeing the destruction of these two 
                  "phallic symbols" on the tip of Manhattan and suggested more 
                  psychoanalytic insight for us all. <BR><BR>Against this 
                  backdrop, there may be a place for some psychological 
                  realism--about what terrorists do, how they think, the steps 
                  necessary to protect ourselves from them, and the price those 
                  steps are likely to exact from us. The observations that 
                  follow spring from long clinical experience with similar 
                  matters. The layman should judge them by the light of common 
                  sense and what he knows about the ways of the world. Where 
                  these insights overlap with and reinforce ideas from other 
                  relevant sources--diplomatic, legal, economic, military--they 
                  may enhance confidence in the course of action we must take. 
                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>A REALISt can begin by rejecting the 
                  castration-anxiety idea--even though it provided the only 
                  humor in the whole affair. Americans felt emotional distress 
                  not because the towers of the World Trade Center were longer 
                  than they were wide, but because witnessing the cruel deaths 
                  of so many of our fellow citizens--horribly killed as they 
                  went about their daily lives, unsuspecting and 
                  unprotected--naturally provokes grief, anger, and fear. The 
                  brutal, indiscriminate slaughter of thousands of people in an 
                  instant, along with the sight of their bodies dropping like 
                  debris from dizzying heights, should produce pity, grief, rage 
                  in anyone with an ounce of fellow-feeling. <BR><BR>Next, 
                  having rejected a far-fetched theory, the pragmatic behavioral 
                  scientist sets aside for the time being questions about 
                  whether the actions at issue were mad or bad, crimes or acts 
                  of war, and examines the phenomenon of terrorism itself. The 
                  hijacking of airplanes and the piloting of them as missiles 
                  into large buildings, he notes, the deliberate targeting of 
                  civilians with the aim of producing fear, dread, and their 
                  political profits, is purposeful action. It is behavior. 
                  <BR><BR>Terrorist behavior is different from behavior such as 
                  eating, drinking, or sex in that it springs not from any 
                  innate drive or instinctive motive, but from a set of 
                  assumptions, attitudes, and beliefs that the actors have taken 
                  from their culture and share with many others. In contrast to 
                  their fellow citizens, however, these actors bring a ferocious 
                  passion to these ideas, a passion that leads them to ignore 
                  all other considerations such as personal safety, humane 
                  feelings, compromise, or temporizing alternatives. <BR><BR>In 
                  everyday speech, we call such people "fanatics." 
                  Psychiatrists, however, have their own, less loaded term. They 
                  say that people with this passionate attitude have an 
                  "overvalued idea." This conceptual distinction in mental life 
                  was first made by the late-19th-century German psychiatrist 
                  Carl Wernicke. <BR><BR>An overvalued idea is a thought shared 
                  with others in a society or culture but in the patient held 
                  with an intense emotional commitment capable of provoking 
                  dominant behaviors in its service. An overvalued idea differs 
                  from a delusion in that delusions are false ideas unique to 
                  the possessor, whereas overvalued ideas develop from 
                  assumptions and beliefs shared by many others. An overvalued 
                  idea differs, too, from an obsession in that, although it 
                  dominates the mind as an obsession does, the subject does not 
                  fight an overvalued idea but instead relishes, amplifies, and 
                  defends it. Indeed the idea fulminates in the mind of the 
                  subject, growing more dominant over time, more refined, and 
                  more resistant to challenge. <BR><BR>The major contemporary 
                  clinical disorder prompted by an overvalued idea is anorexia 
                  nervosa. Patients suffering from this illness take an idea 
                  common among young women in our society--thinner is 
                  better--and amplify it into a commitment so dominant that they 
                  starve themselves. At first an anorexic may claim that she is 
                  no different from any woman "thinking thin." As she persists 
                  with a worrisome starvation diet, she may justify eating only 
                  low fat salads as her way to "health." All therapeutic 
                  attempts to correct the behavior by dissuading her of this 
                  idea or uncovering its root cause fail, because the overvalued 
                  idea--one cannot be too thin--resists logical argument and 
                  compromise. Only stopping the behavior--which may require 
                  bringing the patient under 24 hour supervision--can lead the 
                  anorexic to recover. <BR><BR>But overvalued ideas also crop up 
                  outside the clinical setting. Two recent examples of 
                  individuals with overvalued ideas are the Unabomber and Jack 
                  Kevorkian. The Unabomber, preoccupied with what he saw as the 
                  materialism and destructive reliance on technology of our 
                  society, carried out vicious and cowardly letter bomb assaults 
                  against many defenseless people he associated with these 
                  enterprises. When his rambling, expansive, and tedious 
                  explanations were published in the Washington Post, many 
                  readers reported that they agreed with much of what he said. 
                  <BR><BR>Jack Kevorkian, despite killing scores of sick, 
                  emotionally vulnerable people in Michigan, persuaded several 
                  juries that his ideas about assisted suicide were well 
                  intended, even though contrary to law. Juries repeatedly freed 
                  him, until his indiscriminate killing and disdain for the 
                  courts became too much to stomach. Kevorkian and the Unabomber 
                  now sit in jail because only incarceration could keep them 
                  from continuing their violence. Neither of them is mad in the 
                  sense of being out of contact with reality, but both of them 
                  are bad because of their vile opinions and vicious behavior. 
                  Their "brain images" would make no difference to such 
                  judgments. <BR><BR>Three historical figures with overvalued 
                  ideas are Adolf Hitler with his anti-Semitism, Carrie Nation 
                  with her excessive devotion to temperance, and John Brown the 
                  abolitionist. Note that an overvalued idea may not in itself 
                  be wrong. Enough people agreed with Carrie Nation to pass the 
                  18th Amendment; and all now agree with John Brown that slavery 
                  is evil, even though they deplore his assaults on defenseless 
                  farmers in Kansas and his killing spree at Harpers Ferry. 
                  <BR><BR>Overvalued ideas develop as ruling passions in some 
                  vulnerable individuals. Anorexics tend to be introverted young 
                  women, impressionable and easily conditioned by criticism of 
                  their physical appearance. The Unabomber, Jack Kevorkian, and 
                  the World Trade Center terrorists also tended to a personality 
                  type, arrogant and over-confident, suspicious of others, 
                  lacking in warmth, and tediously argumentative, shifting their 
                  ground to justify their fixed opinions when faced with strong 
                  objections. Cold, paranoid, and aggressive are terms that 
                  describe them. All efforts to correct the behavior of such 
                  people by addressing its "root causes" will fail because those 
                  "causes" are not actually motivating these people's 
                  behavior--their passions are. <BR><BR><BR><BR>DEFINING the 
                  September 11 attacks as behavior and the terrorists as men 
                  driven by the overvalued idea that America is a satanic nation 
                  whose citizens deserve death has implications for ways of 
                  defeating them. Here, recent psychiatric experience in 
                  treating behavior disorders can help. <BR><BR>Before about 
                  1975, psychiatrists treating patients with destructive 
                  behaviors such as anorexia, alcoholism, and sexual disorders 
                  believed that one should first find the psychological roots of 
                  these behaviors by uncovering their meaning in the patient's 
                  mental conflicts. They thought that if these meaningful 
                  conflicts could be resolved, the abnormal behavior would 
                  wither away. This approach failed. Treatment programs for 
                  anorexia, for example, that ignored the failure to eat while 
                  attending to its meaning had death rates of between 10 percent 
                  and 15 percent of their patients. Alcoholics continued to 
                  drink, sex offenders to offend, even while their psychiatrists 
                  claimed to be reaching an understanding of their problems. 
                  <BR><BR>These results eventually caused doctors to try 
                  treatments that directly interrupted the harmful behavior. 
                  Anorexics were brought under dietary supervision, alcoholics 
                  were detoxified and sent to clinics implementing the 12 step 
                  program of Alcoholics Anonymous, and sex offenders were given 
                  testosterone-suppressing medications and vigorous group 
                  therapy concentrated on discrediting their activities and 
                  their justifications. These treatments worked far better: Many 
                  more anorexics, alcoholics, and sex offenders recovered. 
                  <BR><BR>This experience taught psychiatrists that behavior, 
                  once begun, maintains itself. Anorexics like to see their 
                  weight and dress size steadily shrink. Alcoholics, drug 
                  addicts, and sex offenders get immediate pleasurable 
                  reinforcement to continue their activities. <BR><BR>The same 
                  is true of terrorists: Their behavior is maintained by its 
                  consequences, especially the publicity that draws attention to 
                  the terrorist and his ideas. The Unabomber hated to be pushed 
                  off center stage by Timothy McVeigh and so killed two more 
                  people right after the Oklahoma City bombing. Jack Kevorkian 
                  started videotaping his killings for CBS TV when Michigan 
                  ceased bringing him to court. Although the September 11 
                  terrorists died in their assault, they were sure of worldwide 
                  publicity for their actions and their views. Their success 
                  brought dancing to the streets in certain Muslim cities and 
                  recruits to their war against America--far more recruits than 
                  any "root cause" of terrorism, such as poverty or anger at 
                  Israel, had brought. <BR><BR>By implication, then, to stop 
                  terrorism, the American government should devote its energies 
                  to interrupting the terrorists' behavior in all its aspects. 
                  The government should use every reasonable method to apprehend 
                  individuals who could carry out terrorist actions. It should 
                  protect vulnerable sites and situations. And most crucially, 
                  it should alter the consequences of the September 11 assault: 
                  To our injuries it should promptly add injuries to those 
                  responsible for the attack. <BR><BR>This policy should be 
                  judged simply and tough-mindedly by its success in preventing 
                  more terrorist behavior. Preventing terrorist events must be 
                  our prime aim, not just because each atrocity is an evil in 
                  itself, but also because terrorism, like every other behavior, 
                  grows with its performance. To accommodate ourselves to it as 
                  a "fact of life" is to sustain it. <BR><BR>Our government can 
                  ignore certain matters for the moment. We should not expend 
                  much energy unearthing the "preconditions" for terrorism or 
                  pay credence to the justifying explanations offered by 
                  spokesmen for terrorists, no matter how reasonable they may 
                  seem. In truth, there are as many reasons offered for 
                  terrorism as there are terrorists--just as Alcoholics 
                  Anonymous has learned that there are as many reasons offered 
                  for drinking as there are drunks. <BR><BR>Stop the behavior 
                  first, and then, once peace is restored, we can deal with 
                  underlying issues. We will very likely find that many of the 
                  justifications now offered for terrorism were only 
                  rationalizations intended to excuse it. But we need not waste 
                  our energies trying to change the opinions of terrorists about 
                  us and our aims. These people, like the Unabomber and Jack 
                  Kevorkian, have overvalued ideas that are inaccessible to 
                  argument and persuasion. Their behavior will continue unless 
                  they are captured or killed. <BR><BR>Whether we call the 
                  terrorists' atrocities acts of war or crimes should be 
                  determined by one thing: which term best helps us stop the 
                  behavior. It seems more likely that we can keep terrorists 
                  from striking again if we treat them as soldiers captured 
                  committing acts of war on a battlefield of their own devising 
                  than if we treat them as individuals indicted for crimes and 
                  innocent until proven guilty. The IRA terrorists and 
                  sympathizers confined to the Maze prison at Long Kesh in 
                  Northern Ireland demanded the status of soldier-prisoners 
                  rather than criminal-prisoners. Certainly our laws can 
                  accommodate their Muslim counterparts. 
                  <BR><BR><BR><BR>FINALLY, what of the concern that military 
                  action will generate martyrs, draw recruits to the terrorists' 
                  cause, and produce endless conflict? Psychiatrists are 
                  familiar with this worry. It crops up whenever they propose a 
                  treatment aimed at interrupting a behavior. Patients and 
                  relatives all see and object to the intrusion on the patient's 
                  autonomy--such as the demand that the anorexic stay in a 
                  hospital so that her eating can be supervised or the 
                  requirement that the sex offender take libido-reducing 
                  medications. They wonder whether this will only cause patients 
                  to "dig in their heels" or "lose self-esteem." They propose 
                  that the psychiatrist should discover and resolve some 
                  meaningful conflict behind the behavior and so spare the 
                  patient a distressing treatment. Psychiatrists must explain to 
                  patients and their families that every effort to interrupt or 
                  change behavior elicits short-term losses, which are the price 
                  of recovery. Clinicians must weigh the inevitable short-term 
                  losses against the potential long-term gains. 
                  <BR><BR>Sometimes the likely losses are excessive. The classic 
                  illustration is stopping a lynch mob. One had best not attempt 
                  this alone, as the short-term cost to oneself could be 
                  terminal. Better to bring an army to stop a mob. Then, after 
                  order is restored and the hard feelings that are the 
                  short-term cost of preventing the crowd from working its will 
                  have dissipated, work to end the ideas and attitudes that 
                  support lynching. <BR><BR>In America's effort to interrupt the 
                  behavior of terrorists, many of whom are nestled in our 
                  country, the government may need laws that temporarily reduce 
                  civil liberties. We may have to go on a war footing, with 
                  special authority turned over temporarily to the military. We 
                  may have to sacrifice privileges in travel and tax relief. 
                  Discussion and careful judgments should aim to minimize and 
                  justify these losses. All such measures should be reassessed 
                  regularly. But they should be understood as the inevitable 
                  short-term costs of interrupting terrorist behavior. 
                  <BR><BR>The same sort of reasoning applies to our dealings 
                  with other countries. We have spent decades building up 
                  certain political and diplomatic relationships during 
                  peacetime. Some of these relationships will be damaged as we 
                  vigorously bring war to terrorists and their sympathizers and 
                  demand help from those who would call us friends. Again, we 
                  should consider what immediate losses might be irreparable and 
                  avoid actions that produce them. A nuclear winter would 
                  obviously be an unacceptable short-term cost. An increase in 
                  the vociferous complaining about America on Arab TV, however, 
                  can be expected and tolerated. <BR><BR>Some short-term costs 
                  deserve extensive discussion, informed by the concerns of 
                  diplomats, economists, lawyers, and others, before they are 
                  accepted or rejected. Psychiatrists have little to contribute 
                  to these proceedings other than to point out that the 
                  criterion for judging a policy is clear: If terrorist behavior 
                  continues, then--given that each successful attack makes 
                  subsequent attacks more likely--efforts to stop it should be 
                  enhanced, even though short-term losses will increase. 
                  <BR><BR>When we prevail in stopping terrorist behavior, we 
                  will likely discover much support for us in the oppressed 
                  Muslim world, support now hidden by the clamor for war. We can 
                  be sure that most Muslim mothers and fathers do not want their 
                  children lured to violent deaths in the name of some wild, 
                  overvalued idea promoted by charismatic tyrants whose own sons 
                  never get sent on suicide missions. Freedom will be welcomed 
                  once the majority can speak openly. We already see this in 
                  Afghanistan. The short-term losses of the bombing phase have 
                  been overcome by the joy of long-term release from the 
                  Taliban. <BR><BR>In sum, a realistic, pragmatic psychiatric 
                  depiction of terrorism--one that avoids dubious theories about 
                  meaning, as well as wishful thinking about how to manage 
                  it--can dispel confusion and offer a context for the 
                  understandings contributed by other disciplines. Thus, the 
                  proposals advanced here about managing terrorism fit with the 
                  idea of proceeding with a just war. <BR><BR>This approach 
                  allows us to assure our critics that, even as we know 
                  short-term losses to be inevitable when behavior must be 
                  changed, we also presume that many of the losses will be 
                  repaired by the long-term gains of success. All can agree that 
                  force and destruction are not enough for a sustained peace. 
                  Eventually we must repair some of what is damaged and develop 
                  our understanding of the grievances and concerns of our 
                  adversaries. To any who doubt our capacity to use more than 
                  force to gain a long-term peace, we can offer the historical 
                  instances of American magnanimity and devoted efforts at 
                  rebuilding where we had conquered, as after the Civil War and 
                  the two world wars of the 20th century. <BR><BR>We are a 
                  forgiving people, but now, at the start of the first war of 
                  the 21st century, is the time for action--action directed by a 
                  coherent view of our adversaries and of what they are trying 
                  to do to us. Churchill defined these matters better than any 
                  psychiatrist. "Our aim," he said, ". . . is victory, victory 
                  at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however 
                  long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is 
                  no survival." <BR><BR><BR>Paul R. McHugh is University
