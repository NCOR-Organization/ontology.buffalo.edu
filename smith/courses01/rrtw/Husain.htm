      </FONT></CENTER><BR><FONT size=3>
      <CENTER><!--Writer-->By Irfan Husain </CENTER></FONT></B>
      <P><BR><!--Photo--><!--Blurb-->Recently, General Musharraf was quoted as 
      having said that the present weakness in the Muslim world was due to 
      disunity, and that once Muslims were united, they would become strong 
      again. <BR><BR>How wrong he is. The mantra of Muslim unity has been a 
      rallying cry for generations of pan-Islamists over the centuries that have 
      witnessed the growing power of the West and the simultaneous decline of 
      the Islamic world. Many thinkers and politicians have urged the Ummah or 
      nation of Islam to join together and confront the perceived enemy. For 
      them, the lost glories of resurgent Islam would be restored if only 
      Muslims would unite. It is one thing for ignorant mullahs to preach this 
      sermon after Friday prayers; quite another for responsible leaders to take 
      it seriously. <BR><BR>Charismatic leaders like Nasser and Qadhafi have 
      attempted to forge mergers with neighbouring countries time and again, 
      only to have their dreams of Muslim unity dashed on the reefs of reality. 
      I may be mistaken, but I think it was Suharwardy who famously dismissed 
      one of these attempts at the time of the Suez crisis in the mid-fifties by 
      proclaiming: "Zero plus zero plus zero is equal to zero". This blunt 
      formulation may not have won him many friends in the Middle East, but it 
      did reflect the stark truth. <BR><BR>There is a feeble-minded, romantic 
      notion that if the Muslim world was to pool its resources and its talents, 
      it would become a significant power. Let us look at the facts: we are net 
      importers of technology, and we will continue to buy the products of 
      western minds for the foreseeable future. There is no research worth the 
      name going on in any of the forty plus countries with Muslim majorities. 
      So even if we could miraculously form an economic union, our economies 
      would not benefit much from a union as they are not complementary. 
      Basically, we only export primary products and low-tech goods. In brief, 
      there has been very little value-addition in the realm of ideas. 
      <BR><BR>Then there is the notion that closer ties among Muslim countries 
      would result in greater political strength. Closer scrutiny does nothing 
      to support this thesis. For instance, the tin-pot dictators and monarchs 
      who blight the Islamic landscape are so focused on preserving their 
      unpopular rule that they have little interest in rocking the boat by 
      espousing causes like Palestine. While they will pay lip-service to keep 
      their streets quiet, they will certainly not use up their political 
      capital for anything other than self-preservation. We have the examples of 
      Bosnia and Chechnya before us: these were nations that suffered terribly 
      without Muslim leaders lifting a finger. It was the United States that 
      finally ended the genocide in Bosnia while the killings in Chechnya 
      continue. <BR><BR>If General Musharraf is really interested in the 
      subject, he should analyze the real causes of weakness and decadence in 
      the Muslim world. He could begin at home where, until the mid-seventies, 
      Pakistan seemed to have all the ingredients for economic take-off: a solid 
      agricultural base; reasonably good infrastructure for a developing 
      country; a hard-working workforce; and a relatively effective bureaucracy. 
      So what went wrong? <BR><BR>People often lay the entire onus of our 
      painful decline at Bhutto's door. It is true that his disastrous 
      nationalization of key industries and educational institutions set us back 
      by years. But the qualitative change in our approach to progress and 
      development took place under Zia when faith, earlier a largely personal 
      aspect of life, was elevated to a public expression of belief. For 
      instance, two columns were introduced in the annual performance evaluation 
      report for civil servants that required a reporting officer to comment on 
      his subordinate's "attitude towards Islam" and "knowledge of Islam". These 
      columns still exist, by the way, and negative entries have ruined careers. 
      <BR><BR>This example should serve to illustrate the extent to which 
      religion was pushed into every aspect of our lives under Zia. 
      Schoolchildren are required to learn Arabic in addition to compulsory 
      courses in Islamiat. This obviously cuts into the time they have for other 
      subjects. And this emphasis on religiosity continues well into the 
      university. The whole country comes to a grinding halt in Ramazan. Indeed, 
      the public exhibition and expression of religious belief is now virtually 
      mandatory. <BR><BR>This sea change has altered our political and economic 
      landscape beyond recognition, and perhaps beyond salvation. Our bankrupt 
      Afghan policy is just one result of a single-point agenda. The face of the 
      Taliban is our face too. The dangerous sectarian militias that are 
      determined to drag us back to the medieval era are Zia's political 
      offspring. Who else is responsible for declaring interest rates 
      un-Islamic, thus driving away whatever little foreign investment that 
      might otherwise come to Pakistan? <BR><BR>While most of these problems are 
      peculiar to Pakistan, the fact is that world-wide, there is a conflict 
      between the perceived dictates of our faith and the demands of 
      modernization and rationality. For centuries, Muslim rulers have been 
      unwilling to provide the space and freedom needed for free thought to 
      flourish, exercising tight control over intellectuals and teachers. This 
      is why there is such little creative activity in the Muslim world. We have 
      stifled ourselves with rigid rules about what is prohibited: instead of 
      leaving it to the Maker to deal with transgressions in the next world, our 
      leaders and mullahs insist on doing His job in this world according to 
      their narrow, joyless interpretation of the faith. <BR><BR>One logical 
      outcome of this system is that it has marginalized half the population of 
      the Muslim world. Despite liberal scholars who insist that Islam does not 
      require women to be locked up, the reality is that in most Muslim 
      countries, the role of women in public life is very limited. The enrolment 
      figures for school-age girls are low, and job opportunities for women are 
      generally limited as compared to those available for men. Low literacy 
      figures among women are eventually reflected in poorly educated children, 
      lack of hygiene, high population growth and a backward society. 
      <BR><BR>There was a recent survey of university graduates among different 
      communities in Britain. Interestingly, over 20% of all Indians are 
      graduates whereas the figure for both Pakistanis and Bangladeshis is 11%. 
      Another study looked at family income levels in various ethnic groups, and 
      it was found that the figure for Indians was much higher than for 
      Pakistani families because in the former, both husbands and wives worked 
      while among Pakistanis, the wives tended to stay at home. With a higher 
      disposable income, Indian parents can afford to give their children a 
      better education and a better start. <BR><BR>Although many of these facts 
      and arguments have been taken at random, they would make a good starting 
      point for General Musharraf if he really wants to study the reasons for 
      the weakness he sees in the Muslims world today. <BR><BR><!--AdvStart--><!-- ---------- Advertising.com Banner Code -------------- -->
