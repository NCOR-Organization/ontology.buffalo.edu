TORURE</FONT></B></CENTER></FONT>
<HR>

<P>
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>It is generally assumed that torture is 
impermissible, a throwback to a more brutal age. Enlightened societies reject it 
outright, and regimes suspected of using it risk the wrath of the United 
States.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>I believe this attitude is unwise. There are 
situations in which torture is not merely permissible but morally mandatory. 
Moreover, these situations are moving from the realm of imagination to 
fact.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1><B>Death:</B> Suppose a terrorist has hidden an 
atomic bomb on Manhattan Island which will detonate at noon on July 4 unless ... 
here follow the usual demands for money and release of his friends from jail. 
Suppose, further, that he is caught at 10 a.m on the fateful day, but preferring 
death to failure, won't disclose where the bomb is. What do we do? If we follow 
due process, wait for his lawyer, arraign him, millions of people will die. If 
the only way to save those lives is to subject the terrorist to the most 
excruciating possible pain, what grounds can there be for not doing so? I 
suggest there are none. In any case, I ask you to face the question with an open 
mind.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>Torturing the terrorist is unconstitutional? 
Probably. But millions of lives surely outweigh constitutionality. Torture is 
barbaric? Mass murder is far more barbaric. Indeed, letting millions of 
innocents die in deference to one who flaunts his guilt is moral cowardice, an 
unwillingness to dirty one's hands. If you caught the terrorist, could you sleep 
nights knowing that millions died because you couldn't bring yourself to apply 
the electrodes?</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>Once you concede that torture is justified in 
extreme cases, you have admitted that the decision to use torture is a matter of 
balancing innocent lives against the means needed to save them. You must now 
face more realistic cases involving more modest numbers. Someone plants a bomb 
on a jumbo jet. I He alone can disarm it, and his demands cannot be met (or they 
can, we refuse to set a precedent by yielding to his threats). Surely we can, we 
must, do anything to the extortionist to save the passengers. How can we tell 
300, or 100, or 10 people who never asked to be put in danger, "I'm sorry you'll 
have to die in agony, we just couldn't bring ourselves to . . . "<BR>
<P>Here are the results of an informal poll about a third, hypothetical, case. 
Suppose a terrorist group kidnapped a newborn baby from a hospital. I asked four 
mothers if they would approve of torturing kidnappers if that were necessary to 
get their own newborns back. All said yes, the most "liberal" adding that she 
would like to administer it herself.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>I am not advocating torture as punishment. 
Punishment is addressed to deeds irrevocably past. Rather, I am advocating 
torture as an acceptable measure for preventing future evils. So understood, it 
is far less objectionable than many extant punishments. Opponents of the death 
penalty, for example, are forever insisting that executing a murderer will not 
bring back his victim (as if the purpose of capital punishment were supposed to 
be resurrection, not deterrence or retribution). But torture, in the cases 
described, is intended not to bring anyone back but to keep innocents from being 
dispatched. The most powerful argument against using torture as a punishment or 
to secure confessions is that such practices disregard the rights of the 
individual. Well, if the individual is all that important, and he is, it is 
correspondingly important to protect the rights of individuals threatened by 
terrorists. If life is so valuable that it must never be taken, the lives of the 
innocents must be saved even at the price of hurting the one who endangers 
them.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>Better precedents for torture are assassination and 
pre-emptive attack. No Allied leader would have flinched at assassinating 
Hitler, had that been possible. (The Allies did assassinate Heydrich.) Americans 
would be angered to learn that Roosevelt could have had Hitler killed in 1943, 
thereby shortening the war and saving millions of lives, but refused on moral 
grounds. Similarly, if nation A learns that nation B is about to launch an 
unprovoked attack, A has a right to save itself by destroying B's military 
capability first. In the same way, if the police can by torture save those who 
would otherwise die at the hands of kidnappers or terrorists, they must.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1><B>Idealism:</B>There is an important difference 
between terrorists and their victims that should mute talk of the terrorists' 
"rights." The terrorist's victims are at risk unintentionally, not having asked 
to be endangered. But the terrorist knowingly initiated his actions. Unlike his 
victims, he volunteered for the risks of his deed. By threatening to kill for 
profit or idealism, he renounces civilized standards, and he can have no 
complaint if civilization tries to thwart him by whatever means 
necessary.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>Just as torture is justified only to save lives (not 
extort confessions or incantations), it is justifiably administered only to 
those known to hold innocent lives in their hands. Ah, but how call the 
authorities ever be sure they have the right malefactor? Isn't there a danger of 
error and abuse? won't "WE" turn into "THEM?"</FONT> <FONT face=Times 
size=+1>Questions like these are disingenuous in a world in which terrorists 
proclaim themselves and perform for television. The name of their game is public 
recognition. After all, you can't very well intimidate a government into 
releasing your freedom fighters unless you announce that it is your group that 
has seized its embassy. "Clear guilt" is difficult to define, but when 40 
million people see a group of masked gunmen seize an airplane on the evening 
news, there is not much question about who the perpetrators are. There will be 
hard cases where the situation is murkier. Nonetheless, a line demarcating the 
legitimate use of torture can be drawn. Torture only the obviously guilty, and 
only for the sake of saving innocents, and the line between "US" and "THEM" will 
remain clear.</FONT><BR>
<P><FONT face=Times size=+1>There is little danger that the Western democracies 
will lose their way if they choose to inflict pain as one way of preserving 
order. Paralysis in the face of evil is the greater danger. Some day soon a 
terrorist will threaten tens of thousands of lives, and torture will be the only 
way to save them. We had better start thinking about this.
