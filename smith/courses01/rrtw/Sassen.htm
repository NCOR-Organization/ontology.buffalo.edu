</B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>The attack 
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon brings home more clearly than ever, 
that we cannot hide behind the walls of our peace and prosperity. The evidence 
has been growing--it is all over the place. But our leaders do not want to see 
it. It will take this horrific event today, with a current estimate of 10,000 
people dead and large numbers of wounded. The horrors of other wars and other 
deaths far away in the global south simply do not register.</FONT> </B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 
size=3>Globalization has not only facilitated the global flows of capital, 
goods, information and business people. It has also facilitated a variety of 
other entanglements. Intercontinental Anti Ballistic Shields cannot protect us 
from hijackers of commercial planes on domestic flights flying into commercial 
or military buildings. Powerful states cannot fully escape "bricolage" terrorism 
-- bombs spiced with carpenter nails, elementary nuclear devices, and "homemade" 
biological weapons. The growth of debt, unemployment, decline of traditional 
economic sectors, has fed an exploding illegal trade in people, largely directed 
to the rich countries. The diseases and pests present in many parts of the 
global south which we in the rich countries could forget about, are now 
increasingly here as well: tubercoliss is back in the US and typhoid fever in 
the UK, the encephalitis producing Nile mosquito has made its first appearance 
in the global north and so have a growing number of other pests and diseases. As 
governments become poorer they depend more and more on the remittances of 
immigrants in the global north and hence have little interest in the management 
of emigration and illegal trafficking. The pressures to be competitive make 
governments in poor countries cut their health, education and social budgets, 
thereby further delaying development and stimulating emigration and trafficking. 
In brief, the interdependencies are many and they are multiplying.</FONT> 
</B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>The 
growing interconnectedness of the world has given new meaning to old asymetries 
as well as creating new ones. The rising debt, poverty, and disease, in the 
global south are begining to reach deep into the rich countries. We can no 
longer turn our backs on all this misery as we so often have in the past. If we 
dislike humanitarian reasons for addressing these issues, we can opt for 
self-interest as a motivation.</FONT> </B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>After a 
decade of believing that markets could take care of more and more social 
domains, we must now accept that markets cannot take care of everything. In an 
era of privatisation and market rule we are facing the fact that governments 
will have to govern a bit more. But it cannot be a return to old forms 
--countries surrounding themselves with protective walls. It will take genuine 
multilateralism and internationalism, some radical innovations and new forms of 
collaboration with civil society and supranational institutions. The violence of 
hunger, poverty, decimation of once fertile lands, the oppression of weaker 
states by highly militarized ones, persecution--all of these feed a complex, 
slow but relentlessly moving spiral that moves into the global north. The global 
north has the resources and power to produce much of the damage and it has the 
resources to redress some of it.</FONT> </B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>Part of 
the challenge is to recognize the interconnectedness of forms of violence that 
we do not always recognize as being connected or for that matter, being forms of 
violence. We are suffering from a translation proble, it would seem. The 
language of poverty and misery is unclear, uncomfortable. The languge of the 
attacks to day is clear. No translation problem there.</FONT> </B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>Let me 
address two hotspots as a way of dissecting the nature of the challenges and 
identifying specific governance mechanisms: the debt trap in which a growing 
number of governments are caught, and immigration. Both of these will require 
innovations in our conceptions of governance. And both show that even as the 
world is more interconnected, we will need multiple specialized governance 
regimes in order to address the issues, rather than more overarching 
institutions.</FONT> </B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>The debt 
trap is far more significant than many in the global north recognize. The focus 
is always on the amounts of these debts which are indeed a small fraction of the 
overal global capital market now estimated at about 83 trillion dollars. There 
are at least two utilitarian reasons why rich countries should worry. Because it 
is not just about an endebted firm, but about a country, it will eventually 
entrap rich countries indirectly, via the explosion in illegal trafficking in 
people, in drugs, in arms, via the re-emergence of diseases we had thought were 
under control, the further devastation of our increasingly fragile eco-system. 
Secondly, the debt trap is entangling more and more countries and now has 
reached middle income countries. There are now about 50 countries recognized as 
hyper-indebted and unable to redress the situation. It is no longer a matter of 
loan repayment but a fundamental new structural condition which will require 
innovations in order to get these countries going. </FONT></B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>The actual 
structure of these debts, their servicing and how they fit into debtor countries 
economies, suggest that most of these countries will not be able to pay this 
debt in full under current conditions. Debt service ratios to GNP in many of the 
HIPC countries exceed sustainable limits. What is often overlooked or little 
known is that many are far more extreme than what were considered unmanageable 
levels in the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. Debt to GNP ratios are 
especially high in Africa, where they stood at 123%, compared with 42% in Latin 
America and 28% in Asia. The IMF asks HIPCs to pay 20 to 25% of their export 
earnings toward debt sevice. In contrast, in 1953 the Allies cancelled 80% of 
Germany's war debt and only insisted on 3 to 5% of export earnings debt service. 
These are also the terms asked from Central Europe after Communism. 
</FONT></B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>A second 
governance hotspot concerns immigration and illegal trafficking. Both will grow 
partly becasue of the conditions described above. The growth of debt, poverty , 
unemployment, closing of traditional economic sectors, has fed an exploding 
illegal trade in people as well as created whole new migrations. As the rich 
economies become richer they become more desirable and as they raise their walls 
to keep immigrants and refugees out, they feed the illegal trade in people. 
</FONT></B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>Yet even 
as the rich countries try harder and harder to keep would-be immigrants and 
refugees out, they face a growing demographic deficit and rapidly aging 
populations. According to a major study by the Austrian at the end of the 
current century, population size in Western Europe will have shrunk by 75 
milllion (under current fertility and immigration patterns) and almost 50 
percent will be over 60 years old --a first in its history. Where will they get 
the new young workers they need to support the growing elderly population and to 
do the unattractive jobs whose numbers are growing, some of which will involve 
home and institutional care for old people? Export of older people and of 
economic activities is one option being considered now. But there is a limit to 
how many old people and low wage jobs you can export. It looks like immigration 
will be part of the solution. </FONT></B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>But the 
way the countries in the global north are proceeding is not preparing them to 
handle this. They are building walls to keep would-be immigrants out, thereby 
feeding illegal trafficking. At a time of growing refugee flows, the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees faces an even greater shortage of funds than usual. 
This will also feed illegal trafficking of people. And anything that involves 
development of infrastructures for illegal trafficking will easily bring about 
an expansion and diversifying of illegal trafficking of all sorts, not just 
people, but also arms and drugs. </FONT></B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>We will 
need regionally focused multilateral approaches involving the governments of 
both emigration and immigration countries, as well as a range of 
non-governmental actors, to develop the capacity to manage migration flows. This 
means recognizing that migration flows are part of how an interconnected world 
functions. The challenge that lies ahead will demand that all countries involved 
move beyond current conceptions of immigration policy in the receiving countries 
and that the governments of sending countries, notorious for their lack of 
involvement and indifference, join in this effort. </FONT></B></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><B><FONT face=Arial color=#8c4600 size=3>We may 
think that the debt and growing poverty in the global south may have nothing to 
do with today's violence in New York and Washington. They do. The attackes today 
are a language of last resort: the oppressed and persecuted have used many 
languages to reach us. We seem unable to translate the meaning of what they say. 
A few then take it into their hand to speak a language that needs no 
translation. That was the language used today. </FONT></B></P>
