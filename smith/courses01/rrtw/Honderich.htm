      THEIR ACTS AND OUR OMISSIONS&nbsp;</FONT></B></H2><B><FONT 
      face=Arial,Helvetica>by Ted Honderich</FONT></B> 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080>In the days after 11 
      September 2001 the awfulness of what happened seemed to make impossible 
      any detached reflection on it, let alone what would be taken as 
      anti-American reflection. In my own case this came to be followed, maybe 
      too soon, by a quieter recollection of other things and also a sense of 
      obligation.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I> 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080>The recollection has 
      to do with a comparison between the worst-off tenth of population in the 
      poorer world and the best-off tenth in the richer world. The former tenth 
      has more than 40 years less of life than the latter tenth. It is as if 
      these millions of human beings were a different species. This is not the 
      only relevant recollection, and perhaps not the most relevant. The most 
      relevant may have to do with one people being dispossessed of their land 
      and degraded. I refer to the Palestinians.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I> 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080>The obligation is 
      simple and also has two parts. The first is the necessity of remembering 
      all victims, not only those in New York and Washington. They all have 
      faces and histories and people who cry for them, even if they are not like 
      us and their photographs appear in no newspapers and on no television 
      screens.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I> 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080>The second part of 
      the obligation is to say plainly what seems true. One's present sense of 
      this necessity can be owed in part exactly to the awfulness of 11 
      September 2001 rather than impeded by that awfulness. More precisely&nbsp; 
      the necessity is to say something true that enters into the explanation of 
      that day and will enter into the explanation of any more such 
      days..&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></I> 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080>The piece that 
      follows here was written long before that day, but it gives a view of mine 
      of it. It follows on from <A 
      href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/terror.htm">Terrorism and Philosophy 
      1: On Inequality and Terrorism, and Differences We Make Between 
      Them</A>.</FONT></FONT></I> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080><I>I have not changed 
      anything in the piece, which is about the distinction between acts and 
      omissions. If changes had been made, they would include my newer 
      conviction that what the rich world, America above all, does to the poor 
      world, is now not so much a matter of </I>omissions<I> as it was and is 
      instead more a matter of </I>acts<I>.&nbsp;</I></FONT></FONT> 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT color=#800080>We and the Americans 
      are now less excused by the fact that what we and they do can be less than 
      fully intentional. We now know more of the far greater awfulness, the 
      immeasurably greater awfulness, of what we are doing.</FONT></FONT></I> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT 
      color=#800080>---------------------------------------</FONT></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Is there not all the distance in the world 
      between our lives and the lives of the violent? Is there not a difference 
      in moral kind between our conduct and theirs? Almost all of us believe 
      something like this. We believe that our ordinary conduct in life is 
      right, or right on the whole, or right enough, and thus far away from the 
      conduct of those who kill, maim, and wreck for what they take to be 
      purposes of justice. That is wrong, worse than wrong. The belief that I 
      have in mind is about kinds of conduct, not kinds of people.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>No doubt almost all of us are also confident 
      that we are better persons, morally better, but what I have in mind is a 
      contrast between acts as distinct from agents. Acts are a related but 
      different subject-matter, as indicated by the simple truths that one can 
      do the right thing for a bad or shameful reason, a reason that lowers or 
      ruins one&rsquo;s standing as a person, perhaps marks one as inhumane, and one 
      can also do the wrong action for a reason or from a feeling that does one 
      credit.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Most of those who engage in political 
      violence of the Left do not agree with our view of their conduct and ours. 
      If we look to what they say in disagreement, what we find may be bound up 
      with a Marxist or another ideology, or with some history of wrongs done to 
      a class or a people or a group of peoples. From each of these things, 
      however, it is usually possible to take away a general proposition that 
      can be considered on its own, free of certain doubtful presuppositions, of 
      obscurities, encumbering terminologies, and too much of the past. It is 
      that we who are law-abiding, contrary to our common belief, do not live 
      lives which are anything like right on the whole. <I>Our conduct is 
      wrong.</I></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The argument for this is that by our 
      ordinary lives we contribute to certain terrible circumstances. We make 
      essential contributions to the shortening of the lifetimes of whole 
      peoples and classes, and to many kinds of suffering and distress and 
      degradation, and to denials of autonomy and of freedoms. In fact we 
      <I>ensure </I>by our ordinary lives that multitudes of individuals die 
      before time, that families exist in single wretched rooms, and that this 
      or that people are powerless in their homeland, or subservient in it, or 
      driven from it.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Of course the judgement by the violent that 
      our conduct is wrong will be taken as in several ways mistaken, no doubt 
      as absurd. At best, it will be said, it is <I>tu quoque, </I>a retort by 
      the guilty that their accusers do wrong. As with <I>tu quoques 
      </I>generally, it will get a scornful reply, to the effect that the guilty 
      are trying to divert attention from their conduct, trying to change the 
      subject, perhaps a subject which finally they cannot face.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>This is too quick. There is a general 
      question about such <I>tu quoque </I>retorts and such replies to them. If 
      a <I>tu quoque </I>can be established as true, is it none the less to be 
      ruled out of bounds? More particularly, if it can be shown that we all do 
      wrong in our ordinary lives, can this be put aside? Can it be shown that 
      <I>nothing </I>follows about the conduct of the violent? It may be, 
      rather, that certain things are somehow inseparable, in logic or in fact. 
      I shall now take this to be true, and in the end say more about it.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is the prior question, certainly, of 
      whether it actually is true that we do wrong in our ordinary lives. Of 
      course there are replies to this. A principal one of them, which is my 
      subject in this essay, is that our ordinary conduct, even if it does 
      contribute to terrible circumstances, consists in no more than 
      omission.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is not as if we <I>acted </I>to shorten 
      average lifetimes or to secure other terrible ends. That, of course, 
      <I>would </I>be wrong. It may be argued in support of this that there is a 
      certain difference of fact between every act and the related omission, a 
      general difference of fact which issues in a difference of morality. In 
      virtue of the general difference an omission may be right or at any rate 
      less wrong when a related act would be wrong or more wrong. It may be 
      argued alternatively that there is a limited difference. Some omissions, 
      including the ones in question, differ from the related acts in a factual 
      way, with the given difference having similar moral effects, similar 
      effects with respect to the rightness or wrongness of actions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>But (a) is there really a morally important 
      difference of fact between every act and the related omission? and (b) Is 
      there a difference of fact between <I>some </I>acts and their related 
      omissions, which difference gives rise to a difference in rightness? 
      Rooted beliefs are in question here, but a small number of moral 
      philosophers (1) have nonetheless been inclined to doubt or deny that 
      there is a general difference that will do the required work. Some have 
      also doubted or denied that there is any difference between even some acts 
      and their omissions that makes for a difference in rightness in those 
      cases.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>My intentions in this essay are to deal with 
      these two general issues about acts and omissions, and so to arrive at or 
      at any rate come closer to a decision on the judgement of the violent that 
      we in our ordinary lives do wrong. The two mentioned issues about acts and 
      omissions are a subject which is wider than that of political violence, 
      one which has not often been discussed in relation to political violence 
      and perhaps never at all in what can be called a non-ideological way. It 
      does not begin to follow, of course, that the issues are not relevant to 
      violence.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is true that acts and omissions is a 
      subject in itself. To anyone who feels a reluctance to consider one whole 
      subject in the context of another, it may be worth remarking that in 
      political philosophy as elsewhere one can keep one&rsquo;s nose too much to the 
      grindstone. There is a kind of concentration which defeats its own end, or 
      at any rate does not advance its own end, the end of getting a clear view 
      of something or of fixing its true weight.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Given our concern with political violence, 
      we might spend time not only on the general question of acts and 
      omissions, but also on war, and on punishment by the state, and on other 
      things. Their relevance to political violence is of several kinds, and it 
      is considerable. If it is true, as it seems to be, that most of the wars 
      of the past ought not to have been fought, and if we were to come to have 
      an understanding of their wrongfulness, we would be more able to judge 
      political violence. So too with punishment by the state, whatever its 
      recommendation or want of recommendation.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>1. SIX CONCEIVABLE ACTS AND ACTUAL 
      OMISSIONS</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The conceivable act of sending poisoned food 
      parcels to India is not one that it would cross our minds to perform. 
      However, how is this possible act related to our omitting to give what 
      money we could to Oxfam, or to some other starvation-relief organization? 
      The result of our omission is that some people die. (2)</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We would not knowingly vote for a political 
      party which <I>aimed </I>to secure that the economically worst-off tenth 
      of the population in European and other economically developed societies 
      continues to have an average of about five years less time to live, 
      whatever the party had to say about the deserts of these people and their 
      betters. How does the conceivable act of voting for such a heinous party 
      stand to our omission in not really working to try to change these average 
      lifetimes?</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We would not contemplate infecting others 
      with serious diseases, but we do not try to secure, as we could, that 
      people have equal and more than minimal medical care. We do not try to 
      secure that end for people in our own societies, let alone people 
      generally.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We would not remove library books from poor 
      schools, whose pupils can have but the smallest hopes in life. Most of us 
      would not try to increase our private profits by evicting families and 
      hence making them homeless. But we do not work as we might for equal and 
      good education, and we do not work for an end to homelessness.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We would not contribute funds to a 
      dictatorship, or to a minority engaged in denying autonomy to a majority. 
      At any rate most of us would not. However, we do in fact fail to 
      contribute funds to political movements against dictatorships, and to 
      political movements against oppressive minorities.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Some may say that there are more &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; 
      ways of dealing with starvation than by contributing to Oxfam, and more 
      realistic ways than those mentioned or implied of dealing with curtailed 
      lives, ill-health and disease, bad education, homelessness, and 
      oppression. Suppose that there are better ways, perhaps joining this or 
      that political party or forwarding some sort of economic policy, perhaps 
      one of &lsquo;self-help&rsquo;. This will not matter much to our inquiry. Just as we 
      do not contribute what money we could to Oxfam, we do not do these other 
      things either, whatever is to be said of their worth. We omit these too, 
      thereby as quickly raising the problem of omission.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. COMPARISONS</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>In what ways are acts and omissions the same 
      and different? Let us consider similarities and differences, differences 
      which hold between all acts and their related omissions and also 
      differences which hold between only some of them.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(i) An act is a bodily movement or stillness 
      deriving from intention, or a sequence of movements or of movements and 
      stilinesses. To say this is to move with some speed past a number of 
      philosophical questions, one of them about the nature of the mentioned 
      connection between intention and movement, the connection described by 
      saying the second <I>derives </I>from the first. Still, it surely is no 
      longer the case that the given definition of an act is controversial. 
      Certainly the definition does not make an act into just a movement or 
      stillness. Rather, an act is a movement or stillness with a certain mental 
      ancestry.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What is an omission? One thing to notice is 
      that the term &lsquo;omission&rsquo; can be used in a number of ways. To mention two, 
      it can be used for (a) <I>the omitted action, </I>or what was omitted or 
      not done, and also (b) for <I>the omitting action, </I>or what was done 
      instead.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>If I omit to turn off the radio at 12 noon, 
      we can use the term &lsquo;omission&rsquo; for what I did not do: turn off the radio 
      at 12 noon. An omission in this sense might be described as an unrealized 
      possibility, or indeed as a mere nothing. Perhaps this conception has had 
      something to do with rather vague scepticism about omissions being morally 
      important. How could a mere nothing be wrong? Of course, this could not be 
      the only conception we have of an omission. Not all omissions could be 
      mere nothings. This is so, to mention but one reason, since we do often 
      <I>witness </I>what we call omissions. These, obviously, are omissions in 
      the second sense, exemplified in the example not by <I>my turning off the 
      radio at noon </I>but rather by <I>my not turning off the radio at noon. 
      </I>An omission in the second sense, which is the more important one, and 
      the one with which we shall be concerned, is clearly not an unrealized 
      possibility.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>How did I not turn off the radio at noon? As 
      it happened, I did not turn off the radio at noon by <I>staying my hand, 
      </I>by performing that little action after having made a first move 
      towards turning off the radio. In staying my hand, further, I did not turn 
      off the radio. We can correctly say more than that it was <I>by 
      </I>staying my hand and <I>in </I>staying my hand that I did not turn off 
      the radio at noon. My staying my hand <I>was </I>or <I>was identical with 
      </I>my not turning off the radio at noon. What we come to, then, is the 
      idea that an omission, in the most important sense of the word, is an 
      action, or, as we may add, a sequence of actions. My not going to the West 
      End over the weekend was my staying in Hampstead.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We have not got a difference between all 
      omissions in this sense and their related acts, obviously, but a sameness 
      instead. Omissions like acts are bodily movements or stillnesses deriving 
      from intention, or sequences of such movements and stillnesses. We might 
      well refer to omissions and acts as negative and positive actions. I shall 
      in fact stick to the familiar terms, &lsquo;act&rsquo; and &lsquo;omission&rsquo;. (I shall use 
      the term &lsquo;action&rsquo;, by the way, as against &lsquo;act&rsquo;, for either an act or an 
      omission.) We shall of course see more of what leads us to regard two 
      actions as being an act and omission, as related in that way. One main 
      thing is that there is the same or a similar or a connected upshot on the 
      whole. Another, is that when either the act or the omission is done, the 
      other was possible.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is of course a great difference 
      between an act, taken as something actual, and an omission in the sense of 
      the &lsquo;omitted action&rsquo; since the latter is <I>not </I>something actual. It 
      is important not to run omissions of the two kinds together. It is 
      possible to do so, and to become a bit mystified, partly because an 
      omission in either sense brings in an omission in the other. If there was 
      an omitted action, there must have been the omitting action, and if there 
      was an omitting action, there was what was not done. It is not necessary, 
      but it will be simplest for us to proceed in terms of omissions in the 
      sense of &lsquo;omitting actions&rsquo;. These, to repeat our first proposition, are 
      like acts in being certain bodily movements or stillnesses, or more likely 
      sequences of these.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(ii) Are all omissions simply actions 
      described in a negative way, actions with descriptions which include a 
      &lsquo;not&rsquo; or something like one, while the related acts are described 
      affirmatively? The trouble with this simple idea is that we do not 
      actually get a division into acts and omissions, since each and every 
      action falls under both affirmative and negative descriptions. My not 
      turning off the radio was also my staying of my hand.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Another idea is this one: an omission is an 
      action or a sequence of actions which falls under a negative description 
      <I>forthe agent, </I>while the related possible act would fall under an 
      affirmative description for the agent. That is, the agent describes the 
      omission negatively and would describe the act affirmatively, whatever 
      other people do or would do. This is so because his intention was what it 
      was. We can imagine a doctor, for example, who carries on in a certain 
      way, which does not include giving penicillin to a badly deformed infant 
      to save him from pneumonia, and describes his action as &lsquo;not trying to 
      keep the infant alive&rsquo;. He would describe a related action, perhaps the 
      giving of a lethal injection, as &lsquo;killing the infant&rsquo;.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>This common idea is no better at giving us a 
      general distinction between acts and omissions. It does not give us a 
      difference between every act and the related omission. Consider another 
      doctor who also carries on in such a way that a person dies. He too does 
      not give penicillin for pneumonia. However, he describes his behaviour as 
      &lsquo;letting the person die&rsquo;, or &lsquo;freeing an incurable patient from 
      suffering&rsquo;, or &lsquo;doing my duty&rsquo;. One of these affirmative descriptions is 
      chosen by him. He may even refuse, for whatever reason, to describe his 
      behaviour as &lsquo;not trying to keep the person alive&rsquo;, and also refuse to use 
      any other negative description. This is certainly possible, however 
      unlikely. The plain fact is that this would not stop us from regarding his 
      action, when compared with giving a lethal injection, as an omission. We 
      here have an omission and a related act such that the omission is not 
      negatively described by the agent.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>If we return to the six examples given 
      above, we find the same thing. If we compare sending a poisoned food 
      parcel to India and omitting to contribute to Oxfam, we shall take the 
      first to be an act and the second the omission even if the agent prefers 
      to describe the second act affirmatively, as &lsquo;buying wine&rsquo; or &lsquo;saving 
      money&rsquo; or &lsquo;looking after my own children&rsquo;. This is not to say anything of 
      the rightness or wrongness of the actions, of course. In each of the other 
      five examples, the same is true. No matter the description of the agent, 
      the second act of the pair counts as the omission, for reasons to which we 
      will come.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Still, there is something else to be said 
      here. We all have a tendency to describe the acts affirmatively and the 
      omissions negatively. This is the natural thing for both the agents and 
      others, evident enough in what has been said so far in this essay. For 
      what it is worth, then, we here have a difference of fact, our first one, 
      but one between most rather than all acts and omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What is the explanation of this fact that in 
      the case of most acts and omissions, the omissions are described 
      negatively and the acts affirmatively, by both the agent and others? The 
      question is of interest to us for several reasons. It may be suspected 
      that there is some <I>general </I>difference of fact concerning acts and 
      omissions which is a part of the explanation of the linguistic tendency, 
      which general difference of fact may give rise to a difference in 
      rightness. (The idea would be that the general difference of fact, for 
      some reason, does not always give rise to negative description of the 
      omission and affirmative description of the act, but it does always affect 
      rightness.) Again, it may be suspected there is a limited difference of 
      fact, concerning some acts and omissions, which difference wholly explains 
      our linguistic tendency and gives rise to a difference in rightness in the 
      case of the given acts and omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is of course an explanation of our 
      linguistic tendency, but, as may be anticipated, it has to do with us 
      rather than with acts and omissions in themselves. That is, it does not 
      have to do with any fundamental properties of some actions but not others, 
      which properties are such as to call out for the word &lsquo;not&rsquo; in their 
      description.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Notice first that it does seem to make sense 
      to say that there are differences between things as affirmatively 
      described and things as negatively described. An affirmative description 
      is such that a thing so described <I>has a property </I>and a negative 
      description is such that a thing so described <I>lacks a property. </I>An 
      affirmative description, secondly, brings in a single property such as 
      redness, while a negative description brings in a collection of 
      properties, those which are other than redness.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Whatever may be thought of these claims, 
      which are a part of the traditional philosophical problem of negation, 
      they do not get us the conclusion that it is a difference in fundamental 
      properties of acts and omissions that explains our tendency to describe 
      acts affirmatively and omissions negatively. This is so, to repeat an 
      essential point, because any action which falls under an affirmative 
      description also falls under a negative description. In every case there 
      are true affirmative and negative descriptions, whether or not we are 
      inclined to use one sort more than the other. Of every action without 
      exception, then, we can say that it has properties of a kind associated 
      with both affirmative and negative description. The explanation of our 
      linguistic tendency does not have to do with there being two separate lots 
      of things, one with one sort of fundamental property only, and the other 
      with the other. All of the things have both sorts.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The true explanation of our linguistic 
      tendency must be otherwise. Let us speculate about what may be part of it. 
      This has to do with an established habit which we carry over from a 
      significantly different kind of situation, but one in which we also talk 
      of what we call omissions. It would in any case have been a good idea to 
      distinguish and set aside this kind of situation and usage. Not to do so 
      would have left open a door to confusion.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>In this situation there is no pairing of 
      actions of the kind we have been noticing. To begin with, we speak of an 
      omission but there is no related act: no act with an identical or similar 
      or connected upshot on the whole. On the contrary, there is an opposite 
      upshot. In this kind of situation, secondly, it is more or less generally 
      accepted that the agent had a particular duty to do what he did not do. 
      There is a generally accepted rule, perhaps a law in the ordinary sense. 
      Obviously this is different from the sort of situation and talk which is 
      our main subject-matter. The duty and the rule or law, thirdly, pertain to 
      an individual&rsquo;s special position or role. For this reason, by the way, we 
      can call the omissions in question role-omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Consider a judge, who has a duty to give a 
      certain instruction to a jury, at a fixed point in a trial, so that they 
      will not be prejudiced against the defendant in a certain way. This is 
      specified by law. Suppose the judge says nothing at the given point. We 
      call this an omission, certainly. However, we do not have in mind a 
      certain conceivable act with an identical, similar or connected upshot on 
      the whole. If we did, it would be more or less this: the act of 
      instructing the jury to have or to act on a certain prejudice against the 
      defendant. (We in fact have in mind the action of so instructing the jury 
      as to try to <I>prevent </I>prejudice.) We think the judge&rsquo;s omission is 
      wrong not because we have compared it with the conceivable act but because 
      the judge went against his duty, fixed by law, in his act of 
      omission.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is our established habit to describe an 
      omission of this sort, a role-omission, in a negative way. This is so, 
      presumably, because there is a settled rule which specifies that a person 
      is to do precisely such-and-such. His error, according to the rule, is 
      most precisely or carefully described as not doing such-and-such, and some 
      care and precision are natural in important and more or less formal 
      circumstances. More might be said. Whatever the reason, however, there is 
      the fact of our established habit with role-omissions. To come to the main 
      point, it is fairly certain that it is part of the explanation of our 
      tendency to use negative descriptions for the other omissions, those with 
      acts related to them in the way we know. &lsquo;Nots&rsquo; are standard in connection 
      with role-omissions, and so come to be used with the other sort of 
      omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(iii) Is the causal connection between an 
      omission and the result different from the connection that would hold 
      between the conceivable act and the result? It is sometimes supposed that 
      it is very different indeed and significantly so. It has been said that 
      the result, perhaps a harm, would be the result of one&rsquo;s movements in the 
      case of an act, but, in the case of the omission, it is the result of 
      conditions which one omitted to change. These words are not terribly 
      clear, but they manage to suggest that the act would be more efficacious 
      than the omission with respect to the result. An act would somehow be more 
      of a cause than the omission.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is the same suggestion in the related 
      statement that the great difference between an act of mine and an omission 
      of mine is that the result of the omission would have occurred even if I 
      had never been born, but that is not true of the act. The same children 
      who are now deprived of good and equal education would also be deprived of 
      it if I had never existed. On the other hand, the result of my conceivable 
      act of removing library books from poor schools would of course depend on 
      my existence.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Certainly there is a truth in this last 
      point, of whatever significance. One way in which it can fail to happen 
      that I do something is by way of my not existing at all. It is plainly 
      false, however, that my failing to do something, a particular action, is 
      in any way less efficacious with respect to a result than would be my 
      doing something, another action. The omission is precisely as much of a 
      cause as the act would be. Staying my hand at noon, my not working for 
      good and equal education, each does obviously make a difference. It will 
      be as well, however, to have some details of the causal nature of acts and 
      omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>An act in almost every instance would be a 
      necessary condition, in the situation, of a result. That is, the result 
      would not happen in the situation without the act. Also, the act would be 
      part of a causal circumstance, a set of things sufficient to produce the 
      result. That is, it would be part of something which necessitates the 
      result, which would not obtain without being followed by the result. 
      Indeed, the act would complete the causal circumstance: the other things 
      would already be on hand. Sending a poisoned food parcel would be a 
      necessary condition, in a certain situation, of certain deaths: the deaths 
      would not happen without the parcel. The act would be a part of a causal 
      circumstance which was sufficient for the deaths. It would complete 
      it.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We can say near enough the same things of an 
      omission of mine, say the action by which I got rid of £500. Suppose I 
      bought a <I>chaise longue. </I>It would be mistaken or misleading to 
      suppose that doing exactly that was a necessary condition of the death of 
      a starving person. Still we can suppose that a necessary condition of the 
      death was that in one way or another I omitted to contribute £500 to 
      Oxfam. By my action I did supply the necessary condition. That fact is not 
      put in question by the fact that I might have supplied it another way. 
      Furthermore, my omission was part of a causal circumstance sufficient for 
      the death. It completed that circumstance.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Given all this, it is certainly mistaken to 
      think that the act of sending poisoned food would be more efficacious, 
      more of a cause, than the omission. Similar comments, although not exactly 
      the same ones, are in place with our other five examples of act and 
      omission.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is clear enough that very often the 
      causal circumstance in connection with omission and result is in another 
      way different from the circumstance in connection with act and result. In 
      the case of the omission, the rest of the causal circumstance for the 
      result is likely to include the omissions of other people, perhaps many 
      other people. Consider the result which is the particular loss which may 
      be said to result from my failing to work for equal and more than minimal 
      medical care. The omissions of many other people are also parts of the 
      causal circumstance for that result. If we turn to the conceivable act, my 
      intentionally infecting people, there is at least the possibility that my 
      act would be the only action in the causal circumstance for the result. 
      Related remarks apply to all but the second of our six examples, the one 
      having to do with voting for the appalling political party.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It would also be misleading to describe this 
      difference in connections by saying the omissions usually are lesser 
      causes than the related acts would be. They have much the same causal 
      features, those enumerated a moment ago. There is only the difference here 
      that it is usually true that actions of others, perhaps many others, enter 
      into the causal circumstance for the result in the case of omissions, and 
      this would not be so in the case of the related acts. There is the related 
      small fact that it is generally true that if I act, intending to cause a 
      harm, there is a small possibility for others to prevent the harm, but ill 
      omit to act, thereby not myself preventing the harm, there is a larger 
      possibility. I leave more scope for good works and self-improvement by 
      others if I omit to act. There is not much to be made of this, of course, 
      unless one brings in certain relgious ideas which are now of the past, and 
      which surely were never sufficient to their tasks.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There may also be other differences having 
      to do with causation between acts and omissions. Often but not always the 
      causal chain or causal sequence in the case of acts would be shorter or 
      &lsquo;simpler&rsquo; than in the case of omissions. Clearly enough a causal 
      circumstance is not less efficacious simply because its linkage to the 
      upshot is of either of these kinds. It is true that certain other features 
      sometimes go with shorter as against longer and &lsquo;simpler&rsquo; and as against 
      &lsquo;more complex&rsquo; causal chains, and we shall notice these features in due 
      course.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(iv) If we consider omissions from the point 
      of view of the intentions of the agents, we can make a very rough division 
      into three categories. It has to do, in part, with the fact that any 
      action, as an omission, has what we can call a certain nature or character 
      and a certain effect. One of my omissions is &lsquo;not contributing money to 
      political movements against dictatorships&rsquo;. That description gives the 
      nature of the omission. The effect is that the given political movements 
      are to a degree weaker. It is the agent&rsquo;s relation to the character or the 
      effect of his action that determines, as we can say, whether his omission 
      was fully intentional, partly intentional, or unintentional.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Fully intentional omissions are taken to 
      occur in medical contexts. Consider the doctor who continues his 
      ward-round during a certain time. To do this is to perform a certain 
      omission, failing to give penicillin to a patient for pneumonia. This has 
      as its effect the death of the patient. If the character of his actions or 
      their effect, as we can say, was the intention of the doctor, then the 
      omission was fully intentional. To put it differently, if the actions 
      derived from an intention which the doctor would characterize to himself 
      as the intention not to give penicillin to the patient for pneumonia, or 
      the intention to bring about the death of the patient, then his actions 
      were a fully intentional omission.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is worth noting that the intentions that 
      issue in fully intentional omissions are in all respects like the 
      intentions that issue in fully intentional acts. Some are impressive, as 
      we might say, since they involve internal resolutions or declarations to 
      do such-and-such, and some are not. Some are such as to take up or occupy 
      the whole attention of their agents, and some are not. Some are formed 
      under higher-order intentions and some are not. Some are, so to speak, 
      something like the whole story of what the agent is thinking and feeling, 
      and some, no doubt most, are not.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Partly intentional omissions are connected 
      with <I>earlier </I>actions and their intentions. The earlier intentions 
      are more important than the <I>immediate </I>intentions of the omissions, 
      those that just precede or accompany the omissions. Out of 
      bloodymindedness, I do not write down a note of an unpromising engagement 
      when asked. I have it in mind that I may forget. There is the result, 
      given my general forgetfulness, that I do forget and do not turn up. My 
      not turning up is one example of a partly intentional omission. Here is 
      another. I look away from the Oxfam advert in my newspaper, including the 
      photo of the starving child, my intention being not to be troubled or got 
      at by it, and indeed not to have to face a moral challenge and to give 
      money. There is the result of this action and a multitude of related ones, 
      that I later buy wine without thinking that doing so is in fact not 
      contributing to Oxfam.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>A partly intentional omission, then, does 
      not in fact derive from an immediate intention which specifies its 
      character or effect, for the reason, roughly speaking, that the agent has 
      so acted earlier that it will not. A partly intentional omission does 
      derive in part from an earlier intention which does have in it something 
      of the character or effect of the later action. The earlier intention has 
      something of the later omission in it. Needless to say, the 
      characterization is very vague. Needless to say, as well, there are many 
      sorts and varieties of what have been labelled partly intentional actions. 
      In fact, my main argument has not much need of greater detail, but I shall 
      say a bit more later in other connections.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Unintentional omissions, finally, are those 
      whose characters and effects are not intended by the agent, and it is not 
      the case either that this is so because of earlier activity of his. He did 
      not so act or plan or contrive at an earlier time to have the omission out 
      of mind when he performed it. If the idea of an unintentional omission 
      comes to anyone as a surprise, this may partly be because of the fact that 
      there is a tendency to think of all &lsquo;omissions&rsquo; as blameable. There is 
      also the fact that role-omissions, as they were earlier called, are very 
      unlikely to be unintentional and are pretty well always blameable. As we 
      are conceiving omissions, and as they will be defined in due course, it is 
      possible that they be unintentional. Nothing much hangs on this decision, 
      however.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>This three-part division of intentions 
      certainly does not apply to the acts which we compare with omissions. This 
      is a considerable difference between act and omission. This may also come 
      as a surprise, and indeed the surprise derives from a truth. If one takes 
      any of the acts in our examples, say removing library books from poor 
      schools, it is possible at least to imagine a related partly intentional 
      action, and a related unintentional action. That is one fact. Another, 
      however, is that our comparisons of act and omission invariably involve 
      only fully intentional acts. That is our practice, how we go on. One 
      difference between acts and omissions as we have them, then, is that the 
      conceivable acts are fully intentional ones, and the omissions <I>may 
      </I>be fully intentional, partly intentional or unintentional.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>I trust there will be no suspicion that this 
      distinction between acts and omissions is somehow arbitrary, or that it 
      will have the effect of begging some question. It <I>is </I>a distinction 
      between acts and omissions as we have them, between the actions which we 
      relate as act and omission. In fact, as will become apparent, my 
      conclusions do not depend greatly on the fact that all acts, unlike most 
      of their related omissions, are fully intentional. More precisely, it is 
      not greatly important to my conclusions that there are possible actions 
      which in fact we do not consider but which stand to acts as partly 
      intentional and unintentional omissions stand to fully intentional 
      omissions</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(v) There is a related way in which some 
      acts and omissions differ, having to do with the natures of their 
      intentions. The intentions that would issue in the conceivable acts in the 
      six examples are horrific or insane, inhuman, vicious, grasping, uncaring 
      in the extreme. Let us give a moment or two to details of this 
      intentionality. The agent, in the case of any of the conceivable acts, 
      would be <I>aware </I>that there were victims of his act, persons at least 
      badly affected by it. He would be aware that victims existed. In the case 
      of some of the conceivable acts, the agent&rsquo;s awareness would derive from 
      the fact that he would have to bring himself into the neighbourhood of the 
      person or persons affected by his act. In the case of other acts the agent 
      would necessarily have a lively awareness of the existence of victims 
      without actually coming into their neighbourhood. This is true of the 
      sending of the food parcel and, in different ways, of voting for the 
      appalling party, evicting people for greater profits and contributing 
      funds to a dictatorship.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is worth noticing separately that in the 
      conceivable acts the victims would be <I>individuated </I>by the agent. 
      One way in which a victim is individuated, we can say, is by the agent 
      knowing such individual features of the victim that the victim, for the 
      agent, <I>is a person. </I>We might spend time making this notion more 
      precise but it is not necessary. We can also allow another way of 
      individuation, whereby groups of victims are known to the agent by shared 
      features, perhaps connected with membership of a social class, which again 
      makes them <I>persons </I>for the agent. As will be plain enough, 
      individuation is something over and above just the awareness that victims 
      do exist. There would be individuation in the case of all our six 
      conceivable acts.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Let us compare this with the natures of the 
      intentions in the case of the omissions or, more precisely, in the three 
      cases of omissions. We must obviously distinguish between unintentional, 
      partly intentional and fully intentional omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Unintentional omissions, as we know, are 
      actions such that neither the agent&rsquo;s immediate nor his earlier intentions 
      involved the character or effect of his action taken as an omission. His 
      intentions, then, are in no way suggested by this action taken as an 
      omission. His immediate intention will have to do with his action taken as 
      something other than the omission, perhaps buying a car or putting his 
      money into a building society. It may be an intention of an ordinary or of 
      course a good kind. In unintentional omission, there is no awareness of 
      the existence of victims, no individuation of them.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>To pass on to the nature of fully 
      intentional omissions, there is unlikely to be an instance of any of the 
      omissions in our six examples being performed in a fully intentional way. 
      This is so, at least, if we take certain more precise versions of the 
      examples.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is unlikely to happen that because of 
      some extraordinary situation, a man fully believes that his omitting to 
      contribute a certain sum to Oxfam on a particular day will result in the 
      deaths of several people known to him, and he does do something or other 
      rather than contribute, <I>and </I>he does this in the desire that the 
      people die. That is, he has the intention of their deaths in the way that 
      the related intention is had by the conceivable man who does the act of 
      sending a poisoned food parcel. The omitter may not have it in mind to 
      support his family or to do any such thing by his action. Such an omission 
      would in fact derive from an intention about as horrific as the intention 
      in the case of the related act. There would also be a similarity of 
      intention in our other five examples. That is, the intention in the 
      omission if it were fully intentional would be bad, and about as bad as 
      the intention in the conceivable act.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is a traditional problem about the 
      nature of the intentions in partly intentional omissions, and the goodness 
      or badness or whatever else of the agents. What has been said here so far, 
      not very usefully, is that the omissions derive in part from earlier 
      intentions, which intentions have in them something of the character or 
      effect of the omissions, in our examples a black character and 
      effect.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We rightly feel that there is more, perhaps 
      a good deal more, to be said against the man whose failure to contribute 
      to Oxfam is partly intentional, as against the man whose failure is 
      unintentional. There is, it seems, a very great deal less to be said 
      against the man whose failure is partly intentional, as against the man 
      whose failure is fully intentional. Still, how exactly are we to judge 
      partly intentional omission? Reflection on the question leads in several 
      directions.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It does seem settled that there is a great 
      difference between the earlier intentions and activity in the case of 
      partly intentional omission and the intentions in either the related fully 
      intentional omissions or of course the related acts. There is nothing less 
      than a gap between not reading a newspaper account of a famine, albeit out 
      of a certain selfish impulse to avoid the matter, and sending a poisoned 
      food parcel or performing a certain conceivable omission with full 
      intention. One can say that almost all partly intentional omissions 
      reflect better or less badly on the agents than the related fully 
      intentional omissions or the acts. This is partly a matter of the degree 
      of awareness in the earlier intention of the existence of victims of the 
      possible future omission. There is also a point to be made about 
      individuation.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We shall later spend some more time on the 
      subject of partly intentional omissions. For now, we have the comparison 
      that in many cases of act and omission, the conceivable act would derive 
      from an appalling or at least bad intention, while the omission if it is 
      partly intentional derives from intentions which do not throw so bad a 
      light on the agent. The comparisons with the fully intentional and the 
      unintentional omissions are of less interest.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is to be remembered, by the way, that not 
      all cases of act and omission are like the six with which we began, where 
      the intention in the act is <I>as bad </I>as in fully intentional 
      omission, <I>worse </I>than in partly intentional and unintentional 
      omission. Consider the three possible versions of an omission of a kind 
      mentioned above, a doctor&rsquo;s not giving penicillin to an old, dying, 
      suffering, and incurable person. It may be that neither the omission if 
      fully intentional, nor the related act of killing, comes from anything 
      like a bad intention. Partly intentional omission would here be worse and 
      indeed unthinkable, and unintentional omission worse and no doubt 
      culpable. There are also other conceivable cases of act and omission which 
      are different from our six.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(vi) Let us turn from intentions and agents 
      to customary morality, to ordinary judgements about the rightness or 
      wrongness of actions. In the case not of all but of many acts, including 
      all those in our six examples, there is a general acceptance that the act 
      would be wrong, or worse than just wrong. There would also be a general 
      acceptance that the related fully intentional omissions would be wrong. 
      The same thing, whatever we are to make of the fact, is not true of the 
      related partly intentional omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The acts and the fully intentional omissions 
      would be taken to offend against one or more rules, principles or laws. 
      The act of contributing to a dictatorship would offend against fairly 
      ordinary sorts of political principles, and no doubt against international 
      declarations of human rights. So with the related fully intentional 
      omission. The same and more is to be said of the conceivable act of voting 
      for the appalling political party with the intention of keeping the lives 
      of some people shorter. So with the related fully intentional omission. 
      Removing library books from poor schools, and evicting families for 
      private profit, and the related omissions, would offend at least against 
      standards of ordinary decency or humanity. Infecting people would go 
      against both ordinary morality and law, as with the related omission. The 
      act of sending poisoned food parcels would outrage anything recognizable 
      as a morality, and also be against ordinary law. So with the related fully 
      intentional omission.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Whatever view we ourselves in this inquiry 
      come to have of the rightness or wrongness of the related partly 
      intentional omissions, then, they are not now accepted as wrong. It is not 
      as if they go against ordinary political principles, or standards of 
      ordinary decency, or ordinary morality, or ordinary law. What I have in 
      mind is a matter of the non-existence of certain conceivable attitudes, 
      practices, and institutions, just as it is a matter of fact that the 
      related actions and fully intentional omissions are accepted as somehow 
      prohibited. Far from being prohibited, many of the omissions may well be 
      accepted as required or obligatory. If I were to increase my contribution 
      to Oxfam to the point where my children lived poorly, in comparison with 
      certain other children in my society, I would run afoul of an established 
      outlook. That outlook requires that I fulfil certain ordinary obligations, 
      that I have and act on certain loyalties, and, in order to do such things, 
      that I omit various other things.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There remain the unintentional versions of 
      our six omissions. Ordinary morality obviously does not take them to be 
      wrong. They are hardly distinguished from the partly intentional 
      omissions.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>3. DIFFERENT COMPARISONS</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The following comparisons between act and 
      omission, as we shall see, have another importance.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(vii) Acts and omissions give rise to what 
      we have so far called results or effects, and might more precisely call 
      main effects. These are usually the events or states mentioned or implied 
      in the description of the action. In the six examples, they are the deaths 
      of some people, shorter average lifetimes of some people, the states of 
      health of certain people, poor education of certain children, homelessness 
      of some families, and political oppression.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>In general the main effects in question with 
      acts and omissions are harms and benefits. Harms so-called are to be taken 
      as including awfulnesses and catastrophes. The problem we are considering 
      arises mainly from the fact that some harms arise from omissions, and so 
      raise a question about whether the omissions are as wrong as certain 
      terrible acts which would have similar or identical, similar or connected 
      effects. There is also the problem, not illustrated by our six examples, 
      that some benefits are as much the issue of terrible acts as they are of 
      omissions, and so raise the question of whether the acts are right. The 
      cases of killing or letting-die are central here.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Not much needs to be said of the nature of 
      harms and benefits. It can be assumed that there is some fairly wide 
      agreement about what states of affairs are to be avoided or prevented, if 
      we can, and what states of affairs are to be secured, if we can. Such an 
      agreement was assumed, of course, in my listing a moment ago of the harms 
      involved in the six examples. There is a considerable problem, certainly, 
      of what general and systematic summary can be given of such events or 
      states. The answer which I favour is that benefits are states or events 
      for which there is something to be said if one is committed to the 
      well-being of everyone without exception, and to something of a related 
      kind for other sentient things. Harms are characterized in terms of 
      conflict with the same ideal. We can agree for the most part on what 
      things are harms and what things are benefits without agreeing on the 
      general systematic summary.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The principal point to be made about main 
      effects has already been in view. It is that the main effect of an act may 
      or may not be the very same as the main effect of the related omission. A 
      comparison as to effects may produce a sameness or a difference between an 
      act and the related omission. It is more likely that there will be a 
      difference. This remains so even when the effect of the act can be 
      described in the same words as the effect of the omission. Generally, of 
      course, there is some <I>similarity </I>between the two main effects, 
      which similarity leads to the two actions being brought together as act 
      and omission. Occasionally, there is <I>connection </I>in main effect, not 
      identity or similarity, as in a situation where a man&rsquo;s act will be the 
      killing of one man and his omission will for some reason result in someone 
      else&rsquo;s killing of twenty. (3)</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Main effects, to repeat, are states or 
      events mentioned or implied in the descriptions of actions. They are not 
      to be taken as including effects on agents themselves unless this is 
      specified. Nor do main effects include what may be called side-effects. We 
      shall notice both these things separately.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(viii) Some acts make it more or less 
      certain that main effects, whether harms or benefits, will occur. So with 
      some omissions. For the most part, however, there is less than certainty. 
      There is only probability, something in between zero and one. The 
      principal fact to be noted, however, is that it may or may not be true 
      that the probability of a main effect, given an act, is the same as the 
      probability of a main effect, given the related omission. Usually the 
      probability of the two possible effects is not the same. If the 
      probability of an effect given an action is sometimes close enough to be 
      indistinguishable from the probability of a similar or identical effect 
      given the omission, the ordinary case is otherwise. A moment&rsquo;s attention 
      to the examples indicates this. Again, it is a simple but important 
      fact.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(ix) Connected with things already noticed, 
      but distinct from them, are what we can call experiential effects on the 
      agent. An act or an omission is within the experience of the agent, and 
      hence has effects on him at the time and thereafter. These are likely to 
      be different as between act and omission. The different emotional 
      concomitants of killing as against letting-die may come to mind. One 
      relevant fact in connection with the difference in experiential effects 
      has to do with responses already mentioned having to do with attack and 
      the like. However rational it may be, we have a <I>livelier </I>experience 
      of attacking than of not-saving.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>A larger relevant fact is that our customary 
      moralities, as we know, include prohibitions of many acts, and so give 
      rise to accusation and self-accusation. What we feel when we remember our 
      partly intentional omissions is different from what we would feel if we 
      were to remember that we had performed the related acts. The difference in 
      experiential effects, of course, will be different in the case of fully 
      intentional as against partly intentional omissions, and so on.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(x) In addition to main effects, and 
      experiential effects on agents, there are side-effects. These may be 
      effects on victims, other than main effects, or they may be effects on 
      third parties. Any of our examples can be used to illustrate the fact that 
      the side-effects of an omission are likely to be different from the 
      side-effects of a possible act. There are, for example, the side-effects 
      on others in my life if I increase very greatly my contribution to Oxfam. 
      These would be different, certainly, from side-effects of the conceivable 
      act. In the second example there would be the side-effects on the 
      economically worst-off tenths of there being a political party with the 
      aim of keeping their average lifetimes shorter. There are possible 
      economic side-effects to be taken into account with respect to our 
      ordinary activities in omitting to work for a change in average lifetimes. 
      So with our omissions and conceivable acts in connection with health, 
      education, homelessness, and political oppression.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The side-effects of a possible act, then, 
      may be roughly the same as, but are likely to be different from, the 
      side-effects of the omission. It is to be added, as in the case of main 
      effects and experiential effects, that we are likely to have a situation 
      of probabilities and of course different probabilities.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>(xi) An agent who did act, rather than omit 
      partly intentionally or unintentionally, would almost certainly put 
      himself in a position different from the positions of others, partly in 
      terms of experiential effects, partly in other ways. The others in 
      question may be members of large classes, such as the class of adult and 
      responsible members of a society, or smaller and better-defined classes, 
      such as that of doctors. Omission of the unintentional and partly 
      intentional kinds is the normal thing. The agent who acts thereby makes 
      himself different, in particular in so far as experiential effects are 
      concerned. He may, for example, take upon himself an unequal amount of 
      guilt, however rational or irrational, if guilt is ever rational. The 
      situation is quite different, incidentally, with role-omissions. There, 
      not-acting is abnormal and unexpected, rather than acting, and it is 
      omitters rather than doers who stand out.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Our eleventh comparison, then, comes to 
      this: those who act, as against those who omit, almost certainly make 
      themselves different or unequal in some class or classes of persons. The 
      examples illustrate this.</FONT>

      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>4. WHAT MAKES FOR RIGHTNESS</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We can now characterize an act and an 
      omission of the kind with which we are concerned as (a) a pair of possible 
      actions (b) taken as identical or similar in main effect, or at any rate 
      connected, and such that (c) the act is fully intentional while the 
      omission can be fully intentional, partly intentional, or unintentional, 
      and (d) the intentions in the two actions may be greatly different in 
      nature. We might add something (e) which has been assumed and which will 
      be of a bit of importance later, that the omission (which we are taking to 
      be the omitting action, or what <I>was </I>done) must not involve less 
      expenditure of energy or whatever than the omitted action, what was not 
      done, would have. The omitting action of reading the newspaper at 
      breakfast cannot count as the writing of a whole book.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Our first issue is whether <I>every </I>act 
      and omission are factually different in a single way which makes for 
      rightness. It seems that we can now settle that issue fairly quickly. Our 
      inquiry, a pretty exhaustive one, has turned up no single difference of 
      fact which holds between every act and omission without 
      exception.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The truth seems to be that when people 
      consider two actions with related main effects, and distinguish them as 
      act and omission, they sometimes do so on the basis of some criteria and 
      sometimes on the basis of other criteria. There is no single general 
      criterion. This is not all that unusual in conceptual and indeed practical 
      life. We might describe the situation differently and with the appearance 
      of greater neatness, of course. That is, we might choose to specify 
      several different senses or sorts of act-and-omission, each tied to 
      certain criteria only. There is not much to be gained by doing so.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Our inquiry has of course produced important 
      differences holding between some or many acts and their related omissions, 
      but, before proceeding to them, can we conclude more generally that there 
      is no general difference of fact which gives rise to a general difference 
      in rightness? Can we conclude that we have not missed anything?</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The first of three things to be said about 
      this is that no supporter of the idea that there is some general factual 
      difference, one of moral relevance, has ever made clear what that 
      difference is. This is telling. We are not examining a matter which is 
      essentially obscure. What we are examining, once we have got rid of such 
      light ideas as that we are dealing with an act on the one hand and a 
      puzzling nothing on the other, or anyway an act and something greatly more 
      indeterminate  what we are examining is two plainish things: two actions 
      or action-sequences.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Certainly they may raise great problems 
      having to do with their main effects, experiential effects, side-effects 
      and equality-effects, and they may be baffling or mysterious in these 
      respects. Still, we know what sort of thing is in question in these 
      respects. If there is <I>another sort of thing </I>on hand, why is it not 
      produced? As David Hume may have remarked of philosophical circumstances 
      like this one, a challenge unmet may come close enough to a proof.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>A second consideration is one which should 
      not escape the attention of anyone who thinks of a decently wide range of 
      examples of act and omission. We are looking for a general difference 
      between acts and omissions which supports a difference in rightness. One 
      can look for such a thing with more hope if one supposes, very 
      forgetfully, that there is at least <I>moral uniformity, </I>as we can 
      call it, about acts and omissions: for example, at least a presumption of 
      some kind that all omissions are better, somehow, than their 
      acts.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>This is a non-starter. It sometimes seems to 
      be half-forgotten that there are more cases of act and omission than 
      problematic ones. The fact of the matter is that some conceivable acts are 
      unquestionably better than some omissions. Whatever one&rsquo;s reluctance it is 
      unquestionably better to act, where the act is the killing of one man 
      oneself, if it really is true that the only alternative, one&rsquo;s not 
      shooting, will have the certain effect that someone else will shoot twenty 
      men. It follows that while we are looking for a general difference between 
      acts and omissions, it is not one that is always morally conclusive, in 
      the way of making omissions better. We are looking for a general 
      difference which is of an uncertain moral effect. Such a thing is 
      conceivable, but not much more.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is one final consideration which I 
      shall postpone for a bit, until after we have considered the non-general 
      differences between acts and omissions. With the aid of that final 
      consideration we shall conclude that there is in fact no entirely general 
      difference between acts and omissions which gives rise to a difference in 
      rightness.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Let us now consider the limited factual 
      differences between acts and omissions which we came upon in our inquiry. 
      Some of these give rise to differences in rightness, but which are 
      they?</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The first limited difference (ii) was that 
      there is a tendency for omissions to be described negatively and acts to 
      be described affirmatively. It is unthinkable that this linguistic 
      difference in itself is such as to make an action right or wrong, or more 
      right or more wrong. The presence of a &lsquo;not&rsquo; or something like it in a 
      description cannot itself be of moral relevance. One may feel that the 
      linguistic fact is somehow relevant to the matter in hand. This comes 
      about, presumably, not only because of its connection with role-omissions, 
      but because it is connected with non-linguistic facts, to which we shall 
      come, which are of relevance to rightness.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The next limited difference we came upon 
      (iii) was basically that while each of an omission and an act is a 
      necessary condition of its respective effect, it is usually the case that 
      the omissions of other people are also necessary conditions of the 
      omission&rsquo;s effect. Not only I but also others must fail to contribute to 
      Oxfam in order for some persons to die. It cannot be, however, that my 
      action can be made right, let us say, by the existence of others like it. 
      There might be excuse for me in the fact of numbers, but it can hardly be 
      that what I do, my action, is made right or better by it. By way of 
      analogy, torturing would not be better if there were more 
      torturers.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Nor, by the way, does there seem any force 
      in another mentioned aspect of connections between the actions and their 
      results. If an action of mine could have prevented great distress, and did 
      not, it cannot be that its status is improved by the fact that the 
      distress would have occurred had I not existed.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What of (iv) the fact that the acts would be 
      fully intentional and the omissions may be fully intentional or partly 
      intentional or unintentional? Let us have in mind the particular 
      comparison between acts and partly intentional omissions. These omissions 
      are plainly of most relevance to us.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There are those who think, confusedly to my 
      mind, that an act&rsquo;s being fully intentional and an omission&rsquo;s being partly 
      intentional is of importance to the rightness or wrongness of the act and 
      the omission. The kind or degree of intentionality makes the omission not 
      wrong, or less wrong. There is a long tradition of commitment to such 
      views and related ones, its greatest figure being Immanuel Kant. No doubt 
      the tradition has things of value in it, but its central ideas are 
      certainly not ours. That much can be shown, I think, simply by making some 
      distinctions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Our concern in all of this inquiry, as I 
      remarked at the start, is the rightness and wrongness of actions. Our 
      concern, at any rate fundamentally, is with kinds of conduct, not kinds of 
      people. What is it for an action to be right? According to a widely-shared 
      if not universal moral view, it is for it to be the action, of those which 
      are possible, which can rationally be expected to give rise to the best 
      state of affairs. Again, it is the action which would be selected by a 
      knowing judge as likely to give rise to the best state of affairs. More 
      might be said of such a man, but there is no possibility of giving a 
      determinate account of his state of knowledge or his capability 
      ofjudgement. The idea, roughly, is that his knowledge is as great as is 
      humanly available at the time, and his judgement is the best available. In 
      certain cases little knowledge will be available and the best judgement 
      must be tentative or even hazardous.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>As for the matter of good states of affairs, 
      they can be as well or better described as states of experience, states 
      involving amounts and distributions of experience. They do not have to do 
      with any &lsquo;values&rsquo; which are not such facts of experience, the experience 
      of the agent and also others affected at the time and thereafter by his 
      action. It may be wondered what &lsquo;values&rsquo; are left out. If there is a fact 
      about an action which in itself is not a fact of distress or frustration 
      or enjoyment or enrichment, or any other kind of quality of experience, 
      such a fact is not in itself of relevance to the rightness of actions. The 
      bare facts, <I>taken as without efficts in experience, </I>that an action 
      is according to a rule, or that it is thought of in a certain way by the 
      agent, are not of relevance.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What we have, to return to the main point, 
      is that an action&rsquo;s rightness or wrongness is independent of the kind or 
      degree of intentionality from which it issued. That an action was partly 
      intentional, or fully intentional, or indeed unintentional, does not 
      matter. It makes no difference to its rightness or wrongness. It is not 
      that an omission as compared with an act is right or less wrong because 
      the omission is partly intentional while the act would be fully 
      intentional.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is a bit more to be said, however, and 
      it will be best to proceed by considering at the same time our next 
      limited difference (v). It was that the intentions in many conceivable 
      acts would be appalling, while those in the related partly intentional 
      omissions are something like tolerable. The intentions in the case of the 
      conceivable acts in our examples would be horrific, inhuman, vicious, 
      grasping, or something of the sort. The intentions in the case of the 
      related partly intentional omissions are not of these kinds. On the 
      contrary, the <I>immediate </I>intentions may be good ones, such as the 
      intention to safeguard the future of one&rsquo;s own children. The <I>earlier 
      </I>intentions, whatever else is to be said of them, are greatly different 
      in nature from the intentions in the case of the conceivable acts. They 
      involve a lesser grasp of the effects of the relevant omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>According to a widely-shared and fundamental 
      moral conviction, none of this matters either to the question of 
      rightness. As remarked at the start, an action can be right, one action 
      which ought to have been done, although it was done from the wrong motive, 
      and an action can be wrong, something that ought not to have been done, 
      although it was done out of a good intention.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Consider a member of the House of Commons 
      who voted for the establishment of the Natibnal Health Service. We suppose 
      that he did the right thing, that his action was right, even if he was in 
      fact opposed to the idea on principle and voted for the Health Service 
      only out of a completely self-serving intention to gain re-election. Or 
      rather, as needs to be allowed, there are two propositions that can be 
      expressed by saying that he did the right thing. The main one amounts to 
      the proposition that his action was right, understood on the lines already 
      suggested. It is true. The other is to the effect that <I>he </I>was true 
      to his principles, and so on. It is false. If we are in fact concerned 
      with his action&rsquo;s being right, however we may express this, his 
      selfserving intention and his going against his principles is 
      irrelevant.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It would be mistaken, of course, to suggest 
      that the subject of agents and intentions is unimportant. On the contrary, 
      if it is of secondary importance, it is nonetheless of great importance. 
      It is of great importance to us since we want to have such people as will 
      do the right thing. We are with every reason interested in the goodness or 
      badness of people, as indicated by kind and nature of intentionality, 
      since we are concerned with their future actions. The goodness, humanity, 
      etc of a person is our best guide to his future conduct.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>This, however, should not be confused with 
      the idea that what makes an action right is even partly its actual 
      intentionality, the kind and nature of intentionality actually involved. 
      The fact that we have a great concern with how intentional a man&rsquo;s action 
      was and what his intention was, because of our concern about future 
      actions, should not be confused with the mistake that what makes an action 
      right is the intentionality behind it. That question, the rightness of the 
      action, is not touched by the agent&rsquo;s intentions having been what they 
      were, although the action will no doubt indicate at least something about 
      his intentions, and his intentions will tell us something about his likely 
      future behaviour. It is irrelevant to the question of the rightness of the 
      MP&rsquo;s action in voting for the National Health Service that his action, 
      taken with a know!edge of his principles, tells us something of his actual 
      intentions and that those tell us something of his likely future 
      activity.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It may be wondered for a moment if I am 
      really describing <I>the action that turned out best, </I>and 
      misappropriating the term &lsquo;right action&rsquo; for it, while the right action is 
      in fact the action done from a good intention and so on. Some will say 
      that the correct description of the situation is that the MP did the wrong 
      thing, or acted wrongly, and, as it happened, this turned out well. There 
      is nothing unusual in that, they will say.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>I am not in fact confusing the right action 
      with what turned out best. The right action, to repeat, is the one which 
      at the time would rationally have been judged as the one giving rise to 
      the best state of affairs. It is obvious, then, that the right action is 
      not necessarily the action that turns out best in fact, even in the short 
      run. Nor is there any reason to think that our common notion of the right 
      action can somehow be reduced to that. Even knowledgeable judges make 
      mistakes.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What has been said in definition of right 
      actions does bring into view another indubitable connection between the 
      conception of a right action and that of intention. It too needs to be 
      seen clearly for what it is and for what it is not. Given what has been 
      said, the very definition of a right action brings in a notion of 
      intention. That is, to rewrite a bit, the right action is the one which 
      would be favoured by a knowing judge <I>with a certain intention: </I>the 
      intention to secure the best state of affairs. There is no doubt about 
      that.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There remains the different and essential 
      point that it does not follow that a man&rsquo;s act is right, or wrong, if he 
      acted out of this or that intention. The MP&rsquo;s act was right in that it 
      would have been favoured by a knowing judge with a certain intention. It 
      does not follow, as we know, that it was wrong because the MP did not have 
      an identical intention. If, on the contrary, the MP had had an identical 
      intention, and acted as he did, that fact of <I>his </I>intention would 
      not have made his act right either, as in fact it was.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>One final remark. It may be allowed that a 
      clear enough conception has been suggested, and that we can indeed 
      consider the question of whether actions are right or wrong in the given 
      way. But it may be wondered if this question is the fundamental question 
      in morality, or indeed in life. The reply must be that there is no forcing 
      anyone to be most concerned with what is right, with what ought to happen. 
      Most of us <I>are </I>primarily so concerned, rather than with the 
      question of an agent&rsquo;s actual intention taken by itself, or his moral 
      standing taken by itself, or any other moral question. That is as much as 
      can be said, and of course it is enough.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We were considering two questions. One was 
      the question of whether our actual partly intentional omissions can be 
      regarded as better than certain conceivable wrong acts because those acts 
      would be fully intentional. The answer is no. The kind of degree of 
      intentionality of an action makes no difference to its rightness or 
      wrongness. Nor, to turn to the second question, does the nature of 
      intentions matter. Whatever is to be said of the agent, an act is not made 
      right by a good intention or wrong by a bad one.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>If it appears that these conclusions can be 
      overturned  moral propositions though they are (4) -- this will surely be 
      no more than appearance, since it will be owed to giving a different 
      definition or sense to &lsquo;the right action&rsquo;, &lsquo;what ought to be done&rsquo; and so 
      on. This is possible, certainly, but the resulting subject-matter or 
      concern is not ours, and not the fundamental subject-matter or concern in 
      moral and political reflection, whether carried on in books or in the rest 
      of life.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The next difference between some acts and 
      omissions (vi) has to do with accepted or ordinary morality. There, there 
      is a distinction between the conceivable acts and fully intentional 
      omissions on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the partly intentional 
      and the unintentional omissions. The former are wrong, the latter not so. 
      In particular, our ordinary failure to contribute to famine relief, or to 
      political movements against dictatorships, is not wrong, but our related 
      conceivable acts would be wrong.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>One point here is that it would just beg the 
      question with which we are concerned if ordinary morality were taken 
      without reflection to be correct. Certainly we are in no way forced to 
      follow ordinary morality. It in no way follows from something&rsquo;s being 
      generally accepted at a time that it is right. It does not follow from 
      there being an accepted prohibition of the acts but not of the omissions 
      that the omissions are better than the acts. What one needs to do, if one 
      is doubtful about this proposition, is to think of the history of 
      morality. It is a history of what we cannot take to be other than 
      mistakes, a history of beliefs that were both mistaken and generally 
      accepted.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We can allow, perhaps, that something or 
      other is to be said for a generally accepted view, but it is certainly 
      obscure what it is. It is certain that we shall not come to have a very 
      important consideration. The obscure recommendation of ordinary morality 
      is not enough to put into question our conclusion that ordinary morality 
      is mistaken in the matter of the connection between intentionality and the 
      worth of omissions and acts.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We can also allow a second thing. It is that 
      if people do have certain moral attitudes, however right or wrong those 
      attitudes are, denials of them may result in hurts and distresses. If I 
      believe that you ought to do something for me, the fact that I am mistaken 
      does not stop my being hurt or distressed by your not doing the thing. 
      This sort of thing is sometimes of some importance. It is not of much 
      importance here.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Things are different with all the remaining 
      comparisons on our list, all of them involving.limited differences between 
      acts and omissions. All of these comparisons are of clear importance to 
      the rightness or wrongness of actions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is inescapable (vii) that the harms and 
      benefits that may result from acts and omissions are of importance to the 
      moral assessment of those actions. This follows directly from what has 
      been said about rightness. If considerations of death, distress, and 
      inequality do not enter into the judgement of the rightness or wrongness 
      of acts and omissions, then nothing does.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Some have tried to avoid the conclusion 
      which follows, that <I>differences </I>in harms and benefits must 
      therefore give rise to differences in rightness and wrongness between acts 
      and omissions. They have tried to avoid the conclusion that it is more 
      wrong to have two people suffering to a given extent, or indeed a 
      thousand, than one person suffering to just that extent. Obviously there 
      is no avoiding it. Great tragedies are more terrible than small, and still 
      more to be avoided. We can say, in connection with this seventh 
      comparison, that when other things are equal we are justified in omission 
      rather than act if the omission involves the lesser harm or the greater 
      benefit, and vice versa.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The eighth comparison is a relevant one. An 
      act carrying a high probability of harm, other things being equal, is 
      worse than an omission carrying a lower probability of an identical harm, 
      and vice versa. There are a number of related propositions about 
      probability. An omission carrying a certain low probability of a certain 
      greater harm may be worse than an act carrying a certain high probability 
      of a certain lesser harm, and so on.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The ninth fact of acts and omissions, their 
      experiential effects, is also morally relevant. In certain instances these 
      effects may be of decisive moral importance. In other instances, perhaps 
      more, they are less important than other things. Side-effects, the subject 
      of our tenth comparison, are also morally relevant, and perhaps likely to 
      be more important than experiential effects. Finally, it is clear enough 
      that the eleventh comparison, having to do with the position of the agent 
      in some class of comparison, is of relevance. There are some actions which 
      a man might contemplate, and which it would be wrong for him to do because 
      of the extent to which he would be made unequal as a result.</FONT> 
      <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>5. OUR SIX OMISSIONS</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We now have a grasp of the comparisons 
      between acts and omissions. Let us turn back to the particular omissions 
      and conceivable acts with which we began. Would the acts be worse than the 
      omissions are? Would they be no worse? We should now be able to decide. If 
      they would be no worse, the violent have truth on their side in the claim 
      that our ordinary law-abiding conduct is wrong. Their <I>tu quoque, 
      </I>whatever is to be said of the relevance of such retorts, is not to be 
      put aside as a falsehood or a mistake. Let us get the answer to our 
      question.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We have spoken of &lsquo;the omission of not 
      sending what money we could to Oxfam&rsquo; and the conceivable act of &lsquo;sending 
      poisoned food parcels to India&rsquo;. There was also the omission in which we 
      &lsquo;fail to contribute funds to political movements against dictatorships&rsquo;, 
      and the conceivable act in which we &lsquo;contribute funds to a dictatorship&rsquo;. 
      These easy phrasings may lead one to overlook what has not been overlooked 
      in our survey, that omissions and acts can differ in main 
      effects.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>They can differ, as already remarked, even 
      when two different main effects fall under the same piece of language, the 
      same description. Certainly that is clear enough when one stops to think. 
      On the other hand it is possible that omissions and acts be identical in 
      main effects. There is precisely the same situation with the other 
      important comparisons (viii to xi) between acts and omissions. There can 
      be difference or sameness with respect to probability of main effect, and 
      with respect to experiential effects, sideeffects, equality-effects and 
      the probabilities of each of these.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is another fact, a connected one, 
      which is fundamental. <I>We can choose what conceivable actions to compare 
      with our actual omissions. </I>Given an actual omission, the related 
      conceivable act is not thereby determined. There is not <I>one 
      </I>conceivable action which is the act for that omission. In fact there 
      is no fixed answer, or rather, there is <I>no answer, </I>to this 
      question: What is the conceivable act which stands to a particular 
      omission? Habit, customary examples, and simple situations may lead us to 
      suppose that there is an answer, but they mislead us. We choose which 
      possible act goes with an omission, what to compare with what. We can vary 
      examples in order to find things out. We have a freedom of inquiry.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Perhaps the tendency of my argument will now 
      be anticipated. <I>We tend to think that conceivable acts would be worse 
      than our omissions because we have in mind certain of those conceivable 
      acts rather than others. If we think of others, there is the plain 
      conclusion that our omissions are as wrong as those acts. Those acts would 
      be terribly wrong.</I></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Consider once again the first of the six 
      examples as it was given. In thinking of it, we are very likely indeed to 
      have in mind several ideas. One is that sending poisoned food would not 
      merely probably but almost certainly have a terrible main effect, deaths 
      that otherwise would not happen, while not contributing to Oxfam would 
      probably have <I>some </I>terrible main effect, some number of deaths that 
      otherwise would not happen, not necessarily the same number of like 
      deaths. Here there is a difference in main effects, and also in their 
      probabilities. As for the remaining three comparisons, we are likely to 
      think of worse experiential effects for the agent in the case of the 
      conceivable act, worse side-effects, and a worse equality-situation. There 
      can then be no surprise in the fact that we have a strong inclination to 
      think of the conceivable act as worse than our actual omission.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is another comparison. Let us fix in 
      our minds a conservative estimate of the whole upshot of an actual 
      omission and then conceive of an act of the same upshot. How much could I 
      contribute to Oxfam next year? Let us say £4,000. Suppose I do not give 
      the money.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is a secure judgement, surely, that my 
      not doing so will have at least two deaths as its very probable main 
      effect. Let us say, for purposes of argument, that the probability is 75 
      per cent. The experiential effects on me of not doing so will be, very 
      probably, small. My own equality-situation, <I>vis-&agrave;-vis </I>those of 
      people like me in my society, will be pretty well unaffected by my 
      omission. The side-effects of my omission will be considerable: they will 
      include the effects of what I do instead with the £4,000, and also the 
      effects of the two deaths. Suppose, for purposes of argument, that the 
      money will be spent on improving the life of myself and my family. These 
      improvements, by way of certain comparisons between societies, will 
      provide what indubitably must count as indulgences and luxuries for myself 
      and my family. The effects on people related to the two who die will be 
      very different of course.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is conceivable that I arrange to perform 
      a certain act, perhaps a poisoning, carrying a 75 per cent probability of 
      the deaths of two persons. If I were to do so freely, the experiential 
      effects on me might very probably be small, not different from those of my 
      actual omission. Let us have precisely this possibility as to experiential 
      effects in mind. I would not then be the person I now am, of course, 
      subject to certain feelings of guilt and so on. Let us suppose also that 
      the side-effects by way of the two deaths would be the same as before. 
      That is, we suppose it is by my act that I and my family have £4,000 worth 
      of indulgences, and that there are the same side-effects as before by way 
      of the deaths of the victims. Let us suppose, finally, for reasons which 
      we can conceive, that my own equality-situation in my life would be the 
      same as in the case of my actual omission. Certainly we have now conceived 
      of an entirely extraordinary situation, one that is certain never to 
      obtain. That does not matter at all for the argument. What matters is the 
      likeness of this merely conceivable act to my actual omission, and what we 
      say about the conceivable act.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What we must say, of course, is that my 
      conceivable act would be wrong, and thus we come to the conclusion that my 
      omission next year will be precisely as wrong. We come to the general 
      conclusion that our ordinary lives consist in omissions as wrong as 
      certain conceivable terrible acts. Only quite different conduct, of a kind 
      sometimes mistakenly put aside as something for saints, would be right. 
      (5)&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is to be allowed, of course, that my 
      spending the £4,000 on myself and my family will only be as wrong as the 
      one conceivable act. It is not that it will be as wrong as some multitude 
      of conceivable acts each similar in upshot to one of the multitude of 
      omissions I will perform in spending the £4,000 as I shall. It does not 
      follow from the fact that my doing <I>A </I>was also not doing a thousand 
      other things, that I could have done the thousand things. That does not 
      much reduce the gravity of our general conclusion.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Is it reduced, incidentally, by the 
      objection that my omission will be only about half as wrong as the 
      conceivable act, since the conceivable act would also be something else: 
      an omission to contribute? (6) My spending £4,000 on myself and my family, 
      it may be objected, is only harmful as an omission, but the act of 
      poisoning would be harmful both as that act and also as an omission, the 
      omission of not contributing money to Oxfam. The act of poisoning would be 
      about twice as wrong.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There are possible situations in which an 
      objection of this kind is in place, not that its conclusion is greatly 
      reassuring. (The omission in those situations, it might be replied to the 
      objector, is <I>fully half as wrong </I>as some terrible act.) The 
      objection is in fact not relevant to our argument.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>This is so for the reason that the act of 
      poisoning would not necessarily count as a relevant omission. It would not 
      count, for example, as omitting to contribute £4,000 to Oxfam. This 
      follows from our conception of acts and omissions. An action is a given 
      omission only if what was not done could have been done with no greater 
      expenditure of energy, resources and so on than that expended in what was 
      done. My reading a newspaper for a few moments cannot count as omitting to 
      write a book. My conceivable act of poisoning, to return to that, would 
      not necessarily be anything at all like omitting to contribute £4,000 to 
      Oxfam.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>6. CONCLUSION DEFENDED</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The conclusion that our ordinary omissions 
      are terribly wrong depends on there being no differences between acts and 
      omissions other than those already listed. It depends on its being true, 
      more particularly, that there is no general factual difference between 
      acts and omissions. Two arguments were given against there being such a 
      thing, and a third promised. It can now be provided.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>If the factual difference exists, then even 
      if it escapes our detection or description, we ought to be able to feel 
      its moral effect. We ought to be aware of its effect in terms of the 
      rightness or wrongness of actions. Such responses could not possibly be a 
      matter of the special capabilities of only certain persons. Morality is 
      not ESP. The difficulty, of course, is that we have to be sure, about any 
      example, that we are not in fact responding to relevant differences of the 
      kinds we now know, such as difference in probability of main 
      effect.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We can devise certain examples, in areas 
      less controversial than those we have been considering, and hence where we 
      are less likely to go wrong, and with these examples it is impossible to 
      have any feeling of difference in rightness between act and omission. The 
      examples, of course, will be such that there is no difference of the kinds 
      so far allowed to be relevant. We can proceed by way of a euthanasia 
      example. There is the possible act, which might be a doctor&rsquo;s turning off 
      a tap in a blood transfusion tube. The patient, who is incurable and in 
      torment, dies. There is the possible omission, which might again be not 
      providing penicillin for pneumonia. Again the patient would 
      die.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>If we hold the act and omission identical in 
      the relevant ways of which we know, it will surely be impossible to 
      achieve any sense of difference in rightness between the two actions. 
      Certainly it is not hard to drift into the feeling that there is more to 
      be said for the omission. It seems invariably true that if this is done at 
      all reflectively, it is done by changing the example: that is, by <I>not 
      </I>holding the two actions identical in the five relevant ways of which 
      we know. The temptation, if that is what it is, seems near to 
      irresistible. In my view all recent philosophers who have tried to claim a 
      special moral difference between acts and omissions have fallen prey to 
      the temptation, or anyway not taken good care to have their examples 
      satisfy the condition of having act and omission alike in the given ways. 
      If the two actions are really held identical in the given ways, I propose, 
      we cannot achieve any real sense of moral difference between them.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Some will suppose there is another way of 
      resisting the general conclusion that in our ordinary omissions we do 
      wrong to a terrible extent. They will suppose that the conclusion can be 
      refuted or put into question by this argument: if the conclusion were 
      true, we would be moral monsters; the wrongfulness of our actions would 
      surely support this conclusion about ourselves; we are not moral monsters; 
      indeed, it would not make sense to claim this of all of us; therefore the 
      conclusion that we all do wrong to a terrible extent is mistaken or 
      somehow in question.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The issues raised are large ones, and I 
      shall do no more than quickly suggest reasons for thinking that the 
      objection fails.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It has already been remarked that it does 
      not follow directly from an action&rsquo;s being right that it preserves the 
      agent&rsquo;s moral standing. Nor does it follow directly from an action&rsquo;s being 
      wrong that it reduces or destroys the agent&rsquo;s moral standing. Still, from 
      an act&rsquo;s being wrong together with certain other facts it does follow that 
      the agent is open to question, or worse than that. What can be said in the 
      case of our omissions?</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is to be kept in mind, first, that few if 
      any of us omit to contribute to Oxfam in anything remotely like the fully 
      intentional way. We do not <I>aim </I>at causing death. There are no 
      <I>such </I>monsters. Secondly, are there only a few people, as may be 
      thought, whose omissions are of the opposite kind, wholly unintentional? 
      Are there only a few, that is, who have not earlier taken avoiding action? 
      There are more of these innocents than might be supposed, at least if one 
      gives a certain characterization of what is required for partly 
      intentional omission.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>It is reasonable to say that for something 
      to count as an earlier intention-to-avoid, the person in question needs to 
      have had more than fragmentary ideas in mind for a moment, more than a 
      flicker of images. The person in question needs to have had a decent 
      awareness of the relevant effects of the later omission. Also, he needs to 
      have had a decent awareness of what he might do instead in the future. 
      There are many people who have too small a conception of what might be 
      called their world of possible effectiveness. They do not suppose, for 
      example, that they can do anything to contribute to less inequality in 
      average lifetimes. Nor can they be censured for their weak grasp of their 
      possibilities of action. There are therefore more of the innocent, the 
      unintentional, than might be supposed.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Consider now the moral standing of the 
      partly intentional. Putting something out of mind in the required sense is 
      likely to require self-deception. This cannot consist, as some 
      philosophers seem to believe, in successfully lying to oneself, and 
      therefore in believing both <I>p </I>and <I>not-p </I>together. 
      Self-deception, at any rate when it is non-pathological, consists rather 
      in an avoidance of evidence, or of pointers or clues, with the aim of 
      avoiding belief. It Consists in persisting with a question, which is 
      better than getting a particular answer. Part of what enters into putting 
      something out of mind, then, is the fact that we have kept a good distance 
      from places of evidence, perhaps evidence about average lifetimes in 
      developed societies, or the state of education in certain sorts of school. 
      (I have not said enough, of course, to give the reality of all this. There 
      are many ways and styles of avoiding evidence.)&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>To come to the essential claim, there is 
      some exculpation possible for typical self-deceivers. If I have the belief 
      that a terrible state of affairs exists, about which I could do something, 
      that is different from my in fact having a question about such a state of 
      affairs.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is something else to be said of partly 
      intentional omission. Omitting to contribute to Oxfam, to the extent that 
      one is in a state of belief, is likely to involve beliefs as to <I>distant 
      </I>awfulness. It cannot be true that an act or omission is right or wrong 
      because of its <I>spatial </I>relation to its result. It cannot be that 
      our moral obligations are in any way a function, simply, of mileage. But 
      the questions of acts is not the question of agents, and the question of 
      agents is not easy.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What about the relevance of distance, in the 
      ordinary sense and also others, to our standing as moral agents or as 
      human? It seems to be true that those who drop bombs are less morally 
      revolting, if those are the right words, than those who do the close work 
      of hand-to-hand killing. Again, one would feel differently about a family, 
      say, who let a man starve to death in their own flat, as against a family 
      who failed to send food to a man known by them to be dying in another 
      country. What I want to suggest, then, is that the fact that the victims 
      of omissions are distant does have some exculpating effect with respect to 
      agents.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Further and finally, with respect to partly 
      intentional omission, it is safe to say that <I>in ordinary morality 
      </I>it is as if there were some great difference of fact between acts and 
      partly intentional omissions. This is a common belief or conviction. In 
      ordinary morality, further, there is no awareness of the great 
      wrongfulness of our ordinary omissions. These are both mistakes, I think, 
      but they are not mistakes to which moral blame attaches. It is not a 
      general requirement of being a good person, now, that one does not make 
      these mistakes.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>I take it that these various considerations 
      go some considerable way towards exculpating many people. Or, to come to 
      safer ground, and all the ground I need, it seems that the considerations 
      do the lesser thing of absolving most people from being moral monsters. 
      Whether exculpation, or the lesser absolving, it is partly something that 
      is true at this time in human history. It is dependent on a certain 
      general awareness at this time. It is not an exculpation or absolving that 
      will persist, as it is, into the future. One may wonder, of course, 
      whether it may apply <I>now </I>to oneself, but that is something 
      else.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>We were considering the argument that if we 
      in our omissions do wrong to a terrible extent, we are moral monsters; and 
      we are not such, and so it cannot be that we do wrong to a terrible 
      extent. The reply has been that for various reasons a general and 
      substantial proposition about overwhelming guilt on the part of many 
      people does not follow from, and hence cannot endanger, the conclusion 
      about the great wrongfulness of our omissions. It is not entirely clear 
      that the conclusion would in fact be endangered if it did carry the given 
      large consequence, but I leave the matter there.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>7. TU QUOQUE</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>By our ordinary omissions we do as wrong as 
      we might by certain awful acts. Some of us or indeed most of us will pay 
      this conclusion no serious attention. Perhaps it is true that no one will 
      take it so seriously as to act upon it. Such results are dispiriting only 
      to those who are unaware of the history of political philosophy, of 
      serious moral protest, and of like things. Virtually every outlook or 
      institution or practice which is now venerated did in fact begin life as a 
      silly proposition upon which no one acted. It began life as such a 
      proposition although in fact there was enough argument for it, and not 
      enough against it.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>What we must accept, to look back to the 
      beginning of our inquiry, is that those who engage in violence of the Left 
      have a truth on their side when they respond to the charge that <I>they 
      </I>do wrong with the retort that <I>we </I>do wrong. What is to be said 
      of this <I>tu quoque? </I>I supposed in the beginning that it cannot be 
      put aside, and promised to return to the matter.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Overstatement is possible. Some of the 
      violent will say that in fact they are not limited to the <I>tu quoque, 
      </I>whatever it comes to. There is more. They will say that our ordinary 
      contribution to the frightful circumstances of shorter lifetimes, 
      miseries, and the want of freedoms does not issue only in the judgement 
      that we do wrong, and whatever follows from that, but also in the 
      judgement that our ordinary condemnation of violence is incoherent. If 
      this is not neatly expressed by those who defend their violence, that is 
      in a way not unusual, and in a way not essential. It is not unusual for 
      those who act in certain causes to be unable to do well in arguing for 
      those causes; their being unable to do so is not essential to those causes 
      being defensible ones. Policemen and soldiers should come to mind.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The claim by the violent that our 
      condemnation of violence is incoherent proceeds as follows. We judge our 
      kind of conduct to be right, and the conduct of the violent to be wrong, 
      but the two kinds of conduct are alike in a certain fact, and this fact of 
      likeness is allimportant. Each kind of conduct consists in the denial of 
      human needs and indeed of life. On the one hand these things are denied to 
      the primary victims of acts of violence, and also in part to secondary 
      victims, principally the families of primary victims. Whatever else is 
      added, this much must be allowed. On the other hand, as has just been 
      said, there are the innumerable victims of those of us who live ordinary 
      law-abiding lives. They live less long, and badly, and without full 
      freedom.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>On each hand, then, there is the denial of 
      human needs and life. It is also true that while the two kinds of conduct 
      are alike in the given fact, there is no relevant way in which our 
      ordinary conduct is different from that of the violent, no difference 
      which makes our conduct right and that of the violent wrong. We know there 
      is no such difference in the fact that our ordinary conduct consists of 
      omissions and the conduct of the violent consists of acts. <I>There is the 
      result that our ordinary condemnation of violence is incoherent, that we 
      fail to make what can count as judgements at all. </I>Our utterances are 
      as insubstantial as those of a man who &lsquo;describes&rsquo; an object in a certain 
      way, perhaps as being of a certain colour, simply and solely because it 
      has a quality to which he points, and then gives a contradictory 
      description of another object with precisely the same quality. He has, in 
      the most important sense of the words, said nothing at all.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The argument does not work, and in fact it 
      overlooks plain things established in our reflections on acts and 
      omissions. We have found that there are conceivable acts which are 
      factually like our own omissions in all the relevant ways. Our omissions, 
      therefore, are on a level of wrongness with these acts. None of that, 
      however, goes any way towards establishing that our omissions are in the 
      relevant ways like the acts of the violent. That is another matter. There 
      is in fact no likelihood that our missions can be shown to be like acts of 
      the violent in main effect, or probability of it, or side-effects and 
      their probability, and so on. The claim of incoherence can in fact be 
      defeated by pointing out that it is just mistaken to say that our ordinary 
      conduct is in no relevant ways different from that of the violent. It 
      <I>is </I>different in ways in which omissions may differ from 
      acts.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The violent, then, have only their <I>tu 
      quoque, </I>and not the claim of incoherence. But is there something, 
      perhaps much, to be said for the <I>tu quoque?</I></FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The violent, when they are taxed with what 
      will be called the irrelevance of their claim that our ordinary conduct is 
      wrong, can maintain the strong truth that our two kinds of conduct are 
      connected. It is not that the terrible circumstances of misery and 
      injustice, against which violence is directed, come about by chance. They 
      have not come about through historical passages in which we and our 
      predecessors have played no particular part. The circumstances of misery 
      and injustice, rather, are as good as our own work. We contribute to them 
      essentially by our wrongful conduct. It is not that there is no connection 
      between violence and our omissions, but rather that there is the 
      connection that our omissions are essential contributions to the misery 
      and injustice against which violence of the Left is directed.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>More can be said along these lines, but all 
      of it may get the reply that it is nothing to the point. Our ordinary 
      omissions, it will be said, are not the subject-matter. The subject-matter 
      is violence and what is to be said for and against it. It may be that 
      there is the claimed connection between our omissions and the violence, 
      and, for purposes of argument, it can be granted that our conduct is 
      wrong. It is none the less true that the subject-matter is what it is, and 
      that it is not our omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There is only one proper judgement on this 
      dispute. It is that there is no ordained subject-matter. There is never an 
      ordained subject-matter. At bottom the criterion of relevance for any 
      discussion is fixed by the demands of those who are taking part in it. If 
      they cannot agree, they cannot discuss. No doubt anything which is one 
      discussion remains within some wide boundary. No doubt it is true, too, 
      that fact and logic impose requirements of appositeness on answers to 
      particular questions, replies to particular claims. There is no fact of 
      the world, however, and no consideration of logic, which stands in the way 
      of the demand of the violent to bring our omissions into the discussion. 
      It is not an absurd demand. What can stand in the way of it is only an 
      opposed demand.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>My own determination will by now be clear 
      enough. It is that the discussion be the wider one.&nbsp;</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>My first reason is that it seems possible 
      that we proceed in too simple a way if we declare that the wrongfulness of 
      violence is in no way diminished by the wrongfulness of our omissions. No 
      doubt it is worth someone&rsquo;s while to say that two wrongs do not make a 
      right. It may also be worth saying that there is reason to be sceptical, 
      or perhaps it would be better to say that there is reason for some 
      reserve, in a certain kind of situation. It is the kind of situation where 
      we have one man&rsquo;s judgement on another&rsquo;s conduct, and the first man may be 
      influenced by an unhappy perception of his own relation to the other&rsquo;s 
      conduct. More particularly, we have some awareness that we make our 
      necessary contributions to the circumstances which have led and continue 
      to lead to violence. It seems to me a likelihood that this awareness 
      affects our condemnations. Our condemnations, although condemnations 
      still, are likely to be different if we are more aware of our own conduct 
      and its wrongfulness.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>There are two more reasons for the wider 
      discussion. One is that it is in fact more important that <I>we </I>change 
      our ways than it is that the violent change theirs. We do greatly more 
      damage. Another lesser but good reason for the wider discussion is that it 
      may do a little to diminish violence. The narrower discussion, rightly, 
      has less chance.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
      <P><I><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>NOTES&nbsp;</FONT></I> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>1. See the admirable book by Jonathan 
      Glover, <I>Causing Death and Saving Lives </I>(Harmondsworth: Penguin, 
      1977) particularly Ch. 7, and an alarming short article, &lsquo;The survival 
      lottery&rsquo; <I>(Philosophy, </I>1975) by John Harris.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>2. The example is owed to Philippa Foot, who 
      writes that &lsquo;most of us allow people to die of starvation in India and 
      Africa, and there is surely something wrong with us that we do; it would 
      be nonsense, however, to pretend that it is only in law that we make a 
      distinction between allowing people in the underdeveloped countries to die 
      of starvation and sending them poisoned food. There is worked into our 
      moral system a distinction between what we owe people in the form of aid 
      and what we owe them in the way of non-interference&rsquo; (&lsquo;The problem of 
      abortion and the doctrine of double effect&rsquo;, <I>The Oxford Review, 
      </I>1967).</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>3. In <I>Utilitarianism: For and Against 
      </I>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973) Bernard Williams 
      discusses the case of a man who must choose between the act of shooting 
      one political protester himself, or omitting to do so, with the result 
      that someone else will shoot twenty.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>4. See my <I>A Theory of Determinism: The 
      Mind, Neuroscience, and Life-Hopes </I>(Oxford, 1988), pp. 420 ff.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>5. In ordinary morality there is a 
      distinction between what we are obliged to do, and what is done by those 
      who are or used to be called saints and heroes. They are those 
      individuals, such as Albert Schweitzer, who are said to be moved by an 
      ideal, and so to do more than their duty. It is said that they do things 
      of moral excellence, but they would not do wrong if they did not do them. 
      They do some of the things that we omit to do.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>All this is mistaken if the argument I have 
      been supporting is correct. Those who are commended as going far beyond 
      their duty may not be doing much more than just their duty. They are doing 
      things such that if they did not do them, they <I>could </I>be 
      reproached.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>Ordinary morality, with the distinction just 
      noticed, has not been without its advocates. Mr. J. 0. Urmson is one. He 
      tells us (&lsquo;Saints and Heroes&rsquo;, in A. L. Melden (ed.) <I>Essays in Moral 
      Philosophy, </I>Seattle, 1958) that &lsquo;it would be quite ridiculous for 
      everyone, however circumstanced, to be expected to go off and nurse 
      lepers&rsquo;. Does he tell us, however, why a somewhat more sane expectation, 
      but of the same impulse, would be wrong?</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>He does declare that it is the duties of 
      ordinary morality, which of course <I>allow </I>omissions of the kind we 
      have been considering, that are the important thing: they secure that life 
      is not &lsquo;brutish and short&rsquo;.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The phrase is unfortunate. &lsquo;Brutish and 
      short&rsquo; lives, for some, are guaranteed precisely by our not going beyond 
      duty, so-called, by our persisting in some ordinary omissions.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>A second of his contentions is that duties 
      more stringent, more in line with the argument I have been supporting, 
      could not be kept by us. All duties, including the less stringent, would 
      then come to lack urgency. We would come to have that supposed upshot upon 
      which scores of Utilitarian arguments rest, and whose improbability 
      undermines them, &lsquo;a general breakdown of compliance with the moral 
      code&rsquo;.</FONT> 
      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica>The other relevant contentions, in my view, 
      are about as hopeless. The third is that a moral code be made up of rules 
      whose complexity is not so great as to be unmanageable; the fourth is that 
      we cannot have a morality which involves the possibility of too much 
      expectation and too great demand on individuals; and the fifth, not 
      entirely unrelated, is that free choice in moral matters, rather than the 
      constraining weight of obligation, is better wherever tolerable.</FONT>
