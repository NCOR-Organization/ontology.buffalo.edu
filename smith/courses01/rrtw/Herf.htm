      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=5>What is Old 
      and What is New in the Terrorism of Islamic Fundamentalism?</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Mass murder 
      inspired by Islamic fundamentalism and fanaticism differs from the secular 
      totalitarian ideologies and regimes of Europe&rsquo;s twentieth century: fascism 
      and Nazism, on the one hand, and Communism, especially in the Stalin era, 
      on the other. Like the twentieth-century totalitarians, today&rsquo;s Islamic 
      fundamentalist fanatics are convinced that they possess absolute Truth 
      which is immune to refutation or criticism; they despise Western modernity 
      yet borrow its technological accomplishments in an effort to destroy it. 
      They believe that force and terror are necessary to establish a utopia in 
      place of the current decadent and corrupt world; and they explain history 
      on the basis of a conspiratorial construct in which the United States, 
      more than "international Jewry" or global capitalism, plays the central 
      role.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Unlike the 
      followers of the past century&rsquo;s secular religions, today&rsquo;s terrorists draw 
      inspiration from an apocalyptic vision rooted in religious radicalism. 
      Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda emerge in a global political culture in which 
      elements of Leftist anti-globalization discourse and reruns of fascist and 
      Nazi visions of Jewish conspiracies merge with religious passions. Because 
      al Qaeda knows how to speak the language of leftist anti-imperialism of 
      the past century, it suggests a mood that overlaps with secular 
      Third-World radicalism. Yet in crucial matters, such as its view of death 
      and suicide and its stance on rationality, it appears closer to the 
      fascist and Nazi philosophy than to the Communist past. The stand-off with 
      Soviet Communism could end with its peaceful implosion; as was the case 
      with fascism and Nazism, the only way the threat of terrorism inspired by 
      radical Islam can end is through its military defeat.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>By 
      terrorism, I mean the intentional murder or attempted murder of any 
      person, civilian or military, man, woman, or child, old or young, who is 
      not engaged in military combat. Civilian deaths caused by stray 
      </FONT><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>bombs 
      and missiles or preemptive killings of those who are actively </FONT><FONT 
      face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>engaged in acts of 
      terror, neither of which intentionally target the </FONT><FONT 
      face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>innocent, are not 
      acts of terrorism in this sense. In the modern European c</FONT><FONT 
      face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>ontext terrorism is 
      rooted both in the Jacobin and Communist traditions, on the one hand, and 
      in the fascist and Nazi movements and regimes, on the other. At all times 
      and in all places in modern European history, terrorism&rsquo;s many targets 
      have always included a frontal attack on the institutions and principles 
      of liberal democracy&ndash;which rests on the principle that all conflicts 
      should be resolved by discussion, debate, and compromise. Terrorists, 
      however, believe they are in possession of absolute Truths, and thus have 
      the right and obligation to kill those who disagree and who stand in their 
      way. In every instance, terrorists are persons with an ideological 
      rationale that facilitates murdering the innocent with a clean conscience 
      fueled by self-righteous indignation. In many cases their targets have 
      been political leaders who sought compromise or nonviolent solutions to 
      complex problems.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>The 
      emergence of terrorism during the French Revolution represented a 
      regression to the normal practice of war during the wars of religion in 
      the seventeenth century. During the Thirty Years War, Europeans did not 
      distinguish between combatants and civilians but between believers and 
      apostates, Protestants and Catholics. The resulting devastation led to 
      efforts to codify rules of war that would establish such distinctions, put 
      limits on war and political violence, and establish in the Treaty of 
      Westphalia of 1648 the principle that peace required toleration of 
      differing religious beliefs. The American Constitution rests in part on 
      the bitter European recognition that civil peace required the separation 
      of religion from the state. By inventing the new category of "enemy of the 
      people" during the French revolution, the Jacobins again blurred the 
      distinction of combatant and noncombatant and gave renewed justification 
      to murder as a political weapon. Since the Jacobins, terror remained an 
      important component of European history when Left/Right and nationalist 
      tensions reached a boiling point.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Terrorism 
      in modern Europe has been the practice of those who believe that reform 
      and diplomacy are undesirable. As Georges Sorel argued in his 
      <I>Reflections on Violence</I> (a work that influenced the subsequent 
      apostle of the virtues of violence, Frantz Fanon), violence has an 
      extra-political dimension in supposedly invigorating otherwise sleeping 
      oppressed classes and in shattering the complacency of bourgeois society. 
      Apologists for terrorism suggest that it is the result of conditions of 
      social injustice. Violence in the Sorelian tradition is a response to the 
      growing success of working-class integration in Europe and the popularity 
      of peaceful reformism as opposed to revolutionary sentiment within the 
      working classes. Terrorists have repeatedly attacked those who seek to 
      find negotiated and non-catastrophic solutions to difficult problems. The 
      assassination of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand in June 1914 by the 
      Serbian terrorist Gavrillo Prinzip, which was the immediate but not deeper 
      cause of World War I, illustrates this enduring feature of terrorism. 
      Ferdinand was among those in the Hapsburg empire who sought a negotiated 
      solution to the dilemma of nationalism within a multinational empire. 
      Hence, it was key to murder him to rule out all but the most radical 
      possibilities.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Probably 
      the single most consequential assassination of recent history was the 
      murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli 
      religious fundamentalist. Rabin&rsquo;s murder, as well as the earlier murder of 
      Anwar Sadat by precursors of the al Qaeda terrorists in Egypt, illustrate 
      that the terrorist&rsquo;s traditional preference for apocalypse and destruction 
      in place of diplomacy, compromise, and reform has become a sad fixture in 
      the Middle East as well. Through the delivery of violent and apocalyptic 
      shocks to the world of reason and discussion, terrorists hope that it will 
      retaliate in new waves of repression and/or simply collapse under the 
      weight of tragedy. Should it strike out in rage, as the Austrians did in 
      August 1914, the repression will, the terrorists hope, radicalize the 
      masses, leading to further war and violence and the eventual overthrow of 
      the existing order. In Western Europe and Japan in the 1970s and 1980s 
      this terrorist tradition continued in the hopes that by revealing the 
      "fascist" core behind the "illusions" of liberal democracy, a 
      revolutionary apocalypse would ensue. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Terrorism&rsquo;s 
      murderous hostility to reform must be kept in mind to understand the 
      atrocities of September 11, 2001. Like the murderers of Sadat and Rabin, 
      the al Qaeda planners, following the policies of their counterparts in 
      Hamas and Hezbollah, began their planning in the period in which the Labor 
      government of Ehud Barak in Israel was making unprecedented offers of a 
      Palestinian state to Arafat&rsquo;s PLO in the context of the Oslo Peace 
      process. A negotiated settlement to the Israeli—</FONT><FONT 
      face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Palestinian conflict 
      would have been a devastating blow to Islamic fundamentalists. It would 
      lend Arab legitimacy to the very existence of the </FONT><FONT 
      face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Jewish state in the 
      Middle East, something which Islamic fundamentalists find intolerable. 
      Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda propagandists claim that Israel&rsquo;s occupation 
      of the West Bank and Gaza are one source of the attacks of September 11th. 
      Yet, like European and Middle Eastern predecessors, bin Laden and al Qaeda 
      launched the attacks to further undermine any efforts at a negotiated 
      peace in the Israeli—Palestinian conflict.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Another 
      possible political rationale recalls the apocalyptic scenarios which Sorel 
      envisaged and links the mass murder of September 11th to past terrorist 
      practices. It is the hope that the United States would treat this indeed 
      as a "clash of civilizations," denounce Islam in general, launch 
      indiscriminate attacks on Arab populations, and thus generate a massive 
      Islamic uprising in nuclear-armed Pakistan and in oil-rich Saudi Arabia. 
      Then, with oil, nuclear arms, and ideological fanaticism, Islamic 
      radicalism could finally emerge as a major player on the world stage to 
      challenge and then attack the "Great Satan," the United States. Just as 
      World War I ushered Europe&rsquo;s decline and the Soviet invasion of 
      Afghanistan preceded the implosion of the Soviet Union, so a massive and 
      monstrous attack on New York&rsquo;s symbol of world capitalism, democracy, 
      female emancipation, homosexuality, and the Jews would hopefully lead the 
      enraged United States to strike out wildly and indiscriminately. In the 
      short run, this expectation has met with disappointment, though clearly 
      the prospect of instability in the region is a long-term concern. Yet 
      along with this crazed "rationale" we should keep in mind that, as 
      Dostoevsky understood so well in <I>The Demons</I>, at the core of every 
      terrorist movement lurks the nihilistic pleasure in destruction. Bin 
      Laden&rsquo;s celebratory statements following the attacks of September 11th 
      stand in a long line of terrorist exultation over death and 
      destruction.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Such 
      arguments played a key role in the development of fascism and Nazism. Both 
      Mussolini and Hitler were able to combine respectability with brute force 
      on the path to power. The intellectual and cultural atmosphere in which 
      fascism and Nazism emerged in the first third of the century, one shaped 
      by Georges Sorel&rsquo;s <I>Reflections on Violence</I>, Friedrich Nietzsche&rsquo;s 
      denunciation of a complacent European middle- class and its rationality, 
      Ernst J&uuml;nger&rsquo;s ecstatic celebrations of the masculine male community of 
      the trenches in World War I, as well as the violence of the Great War 
      itself created a critical mass of angry, middle- and lower-middle-class 
      men for whom the distinction between war and politics blurred to 
      insignificance. Like many of the terrorists in al Qaeda, un- and 
      underemployed "intellectuals" and youth of the professional middle-classes 
      in post—World War I Europe were attracted to fascism and Nazism, because a 
      violent assault on liberal democracy and bourgeois society by a new 
      movement of hard, disciplined heroes would, in theory, replace the 
      decadent present with a vital future.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>The 
      Holocaust stands as the ultimate act of terror of the twentieth century, 
      the pristine case of the murder of innocents on a vast scale. In the 
      fevered Nazi imagination, the Jews of Europe and the world were not 
      innocents at all. Instead, they were members of a giant, global conspiracy 
      which was always referred to as a singular noun: "international Jewry." 
      This vast, unseen yet all-powerful group was, in their view, responsible 
      for all of Germany&rsquo;s misfortunes: the loss of World War I and the 
      Versailles Treaty, the Great Depression, and the threat from the East of 
      what Hitler called "Jewish Bolshevism" or "the Mongol storm." Hence, mass 
      murder, far from constituting an unprovoked act against a defenseless 
      civilian population, was merely one front in Germany&rsquo;s fully justified war 
      of defense and retaliation against the supposed previous acts of Jewish 
      aggression. This was a lunatic explanation which had no relation to actual 
      events. Nevertheless, millions of Germans came to believe it. Today, in 
      the fevered imagination of Islamic fundamentalism, the United States and 
      Israel, what bin Laden calls the "Zionist-Crusader alliance," have 
      replaced this older conspiracy theory, though clearly there are elements 
      of continuity in the lasting importance of the United States, capitalism, 
      and the Jews as leaders of the conspiracy. As in the 1930s and 1940s, such 
      conspiracy theories invariably lead to mass murder, for only if the 
      powerful international conspiracy is crushed can an ideal world be brought 
      into existence. Communism having been vanquished in 1989-90, Islamic 
      fundamentalism now focuses its rage on old and familiar targets, 
      capitalism and the Jews.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>As noted 
      earlier, despite the similarities of language with that of the 
      anti-imperialist Left of the past century, Islamic fundamentalist terror 
      today is closer to the fascist and Nazi past than it is to Communism. 
      (Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s Baath Party and the Iraqi regime have origins in French 
      fascist ideologies of the 1930s, but that is a discussion for another 
      time.) Twenty years ago, I described Nazism as a form of "reactionary 
      modernism" in which a secular, fundamentalist movement embraced modern 
      technology yet rejected Enlightenment modernity. Flying Boeing 757s loaded 
      with fuel into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon is a terribly clear 
      act of reactionary modernist rage. Just as fascism and Nazism were 
      movements that emerged in societies challenged by rapid modernization and 
      seeking to find a way to blend modernity with tradition, so Islamic 
      fundamentalism borrows the West&rsquo;s technology in order to destroy 
      it.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>A second 
      similarity to the fascist and Nazi experience evident in Islamic 
      fundamentalism today is contempt for women and rejection of their 
      equality, a stance which exceeds, yet recalls, the exaggerated masculinity 
      and backlash against female emancipation of the fascist and Nazi 
      movements. Like the paramilitary organizations of the fascist and Nazi 
      street fighters, the Islamic terrorist organizations are militant 
      "brotherhoods." (Mohammed Atta, one of the hijackers who flew a plane into 
      the World Trade Center, apparently left a request that no women attend his 
      funeral.) Where fascism and Nazism sought to restore the position of women 
      to their subordinate status before the advances made in the wake of World 
      War I, the Islamic fundamentalist vision of the position of women 
      regresses well beyond that point to that of Europe&rsquo;s pre-modernity. While 
      Communism&rsquo;s economistic roots precluded an adequate understanding of the 
      position of women in society, its declared support for women&rsquo;s equality 
      stood in complete contrast to that of radical Islam. Indeed, from the 
      Communist point of view, radical Islam must be regarded as 
      counter-revolutionary and reactionary in the extreme.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Third, and 
      most importantly, Islamic fundamentalism is closer to the fascist and Nazi 
      traditions in its celebration of values which depart from rationality. 
      Marxism-Leninism was a doctrine whose erroneous interpretation of history, 
      politics, and economics nevertheless contained elements of rationality and 
      possibilities of empirical assessment. Moreover, while Communists 
      certainly fostered a cult of martyrdom, they did not make death a virtue. 
      The elements of rationality within Marxism-Leninism combined with the 
      self-interest associated with possession of the huge state of the Soviet 
      Union. As a result the Soviet leaders believed that they had more to lose 
      than to gain by unleashing a nuclear war with the United States. Because 
      the Communists possessed this minimum of rationality, it was possible for 
      the West to arrive at a nuclear stalemate with Moscow for half a century. 
      Nuclear deterrence rested on the assumption that both players preferred 
      survival to self-destruction. Given Hitler&rsquo;s fundamental contempt for 
      rationality and his celebration of the will, combined with the paranoid 
      structure of his interpretation of international politics, the chances 
      that such a peaceful nuclear stalemate could have been sustained with Nazi 
      Germany for half a century would have been far less likely. A Nazi 
      leadership would have been far more likely to go over the brink to war, 
      even if that meant the nuclear devastation of Nazi Germany. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>However 
      enamored Hitler and the Nazis were of an apocalyptic end, Nazism as an 
      ideology celebrated the victory of the "master race," not its death and 
      revival in heavenly paradise. It was a secular totalitarianism. On the 
      other hand, terrorists inspired by Islamic fundamentalism have an attitude 
      towards their own death which is quite different precisely because it is 
      inspired by a religious radicalism that envisages a heavenly paradise in 
      the next world. Radical Islam convinces its adherents that a martyr&rsquo;s 
      death is a prelude to this paradise. Their otherworldly visions clearly 
      inspired the murderers of September 11th just as they have inspired the 
      one hundred suicide bombers who have attacked Israel since 1993, thirty in 
      the past year. They are visions with a profound consequence for the future 
      of world peace and security. Should a radical Islamic group or state come 
      to possess weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, or nuclear) 
      and the means to deliver them, there is no reason to assume that the 
      prospect of nuclear retaliation by the United States would deter war. This 
      is so because, in their view, their own death is a prelude to certain 
      entry to a better life in the heavenly paradise to come. For people with 
      such belief, nuclear retaliation may be a blessing rather than a 
      threat.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>Hence, as 
      in World War II, we are in a race against time. However complex, 
      long-term, and multi-faceted our assault on terrorism will be, it must 
      include, as the Bush administration has made clear, the military defeat of 
      this network. In contrast to the response of the authoritarian 
      Austro-Hungarian empire to the assassination of June 1914 in Sarajevo, the 
      United States is responding to the mass murder of September 11th as it 
      should, namely by seeking to isolate the terrorists from the rest of the 
      Islamic world, to underscore that they have no solutions to any of the 
      problems they mention, that the era in which they can kill others with 
      impunity has come to an end, and that the democracies which they regard as 
      decadent and weak are in fact capable of a judicious and powerful capacity 
      to make a war which will end in their destruction. Terrorists in the 
      twentieth century repeatedly made the error of assuming that liberal 
      democracies were weak and vulnerable. Al Qaeda is making the same mistake 
      of believing its own propaganda about our reluctance to fight and defeat 
      them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=+1>After World 
      War II, European intellectuals turned away from the orgy of violence of 
      1914 to 1945. This is evident in Albert Camus&rsquo;s <I>The Rebel</I> and in 
      Jurgen Habermas&rsquo;s work on the priority of discussion over force. In the 
      late 1970s and 1980s, another generation again turned away from the 
      romance of revolution and cults of violence of the 1960s New Left. A key 
      question of the months and years to come will be whether and to what 
      extent the opinion-shaping elites of the Islamic world will offer a 
      similar liberating discourse of disillusionment with ideological 
      fanaticism and a realistic assessment of the values of reform and 
      compromise. As the experience of twentieth-century Europe following the 
      defeats of Nazism and Communism suggests, sobriety and common sense may 
      very well be the consequence rather than the cause of the defeat of the 
      fanatics and terrorists now claiming to speak for Islam. Be that as it 
      may, it is important that in our country, intellectuals and scholars do 
      what they can to eliminate the last pathetic shreds of legitimacy to the 
      terrorist tradition which contributed to the crimes of September 11th in 
      New York and Washington.</FONT></P>
