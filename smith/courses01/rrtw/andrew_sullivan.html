<BR>The Anti-Semitism of the Islamo-Fascists <BR><BR>One of the most vivid 
experiences of my time as a graduate student at Harvard was a seminar I took 
with the preeminent liberal political theorist John Rawls. The discussion 
centered on Rawls's later work, in which he divorced his liberalism from the 
claim of absolute truth. His argument was only cogent, he averred, if read and 
understood by people who already shared some basic premises--the need for 
consent, the reliance on reason, a tone of civility, a relatively open mind. 
With characteristic tactlessness, I asked him what his response would be if 
Hitler joined the debate and disagreed with him. Rawls answered that there could 
be no discourse with Hitler. We would have to agree that he was simply crazy, a 
madman at a Cambridge dinner party, a figure outside the conversation. To 
Hitler, Rawls had nothing to say, except please go away. <BR><BR>But what if 
Hitler refuses to go away? My mind has drifted back to that conversation 
recently, as we try to grapple with the reality staring us in the face: 
Something like Hitler is back, and it is waging war on the United States. Part 
of the current crisis is that many of us simply do not have a philosophy capable 
of countering him.<BR><BR>Is this a grotesque exaggeration? The argument ad 
Hitlerum is, after all, such a high-school debating tactic that it should be 
employed only with extreme caution. The reason I invoke it is not simply because 
we have an irrational, lethal movement stirring many people across the globe in 
a call to mass murder. But because one central element of that movement, which 
we are doing our best to ignore, but which is increasingly unignorable, is 
pathological anti-Semitism.<BR><BR>Yes, of course, the geopolitical differences 
between anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany and anti-Semitism in the Arab world are 
vast. Germany was the preeminent military power of its time; the Arab nations 
are decidedly not. Germany had a large, and largely defenseless, Jewish 
population within its borders and millions more on its doorstep; the Arab states 
have only Israel, which despite its tiny size is hardly defenseless. But 
ignoring a virulent ideology because we believe those who hold it to be weak is 
the kind of thinking that recently enabled the murder of 5,000 people in New 
York. So consider the following: According to a recent Newsweek poll, 48 percent 
of Pakistanis believe Jews were responsible for the World Trade Center bombing. 
A plurality of Egyptians agree.<BR><BR>This should come as no surprise. Vicious 
anti-Semitism is now the official doctrine of most Arab governments and their 
organs of propaganda. The official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadeeda, for example, regularly contains references to the "Protocols of the 
Elders of Zion," the loopy nineteenth-century hoax that suggests Jews run the 
world. As one article put it (at the height of the Oslo peace process, no less): 
"It is important to conduct the conflict according to the foundations which both 
are leaning on... particularly the Jews... such as the Torah, the Talmud and the 
Protocols [of the Elders of Zion].... All signs unequivocally prove that the 
conflict between the Jews and the Muslims is an eternal on-going conflict, even 
if it stops for short intervals.... This conflict resembles the conflict between 
man and Satan.... This is the fate of the Muslim nation, and beyond that the 
fate of all the nations of the world, to be tormented by this nation [the Jews]. 
The fate of the Palestinian people is to struggle against the Jews on behalf of 
the Arab peoples, the Islamic peoples and the peoples of the entire 
world."<BR><BR>Here's a summary of a gem that appeared in Egypt's Al Ahram, the 
largest newspaper in that country: "A compilation of the 'investigative' work of 
four reporters on Jewish control of the world states that Jews have become the 
political decision-makers and control the media in most capitals of the world 
(Washington, Paris, London, Berlin, Athens, Ankara) and says that the main 
apparatus for the Jews to control the world is the international Jewish lobby 
which works for Israel." It is worth noting here that every word Al Ahram prints 
is vetted and approved by the Egyptian government, a regime to which the United 
States--i.e., you and I--contributes $2 billion a year.<BR><BR>Or take Syria, a 
thugocracy whose leader indulged in an anti-Semitic outburst in front of the 
pope, but a state that Colin Powell nonetheless wishes to bring into his grand 
coalition. In 1983 Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass wrote a book entitled 
The Matzah of Zion, claiming that Jews murder Arab children to knead their blood 
into matzahs for Passover. An article about the book that appeared in Al Ahram 
one year ago (and was noted by the invaluable Middle East Media Research 
Institute) concluded with the following sentences: "The bestial drive to knead 
Passover matzahs with the blood of non-Jews is [confirmed] in the records of the 
Palestinian police where there are many recorded cases of the bodies of Arab 
children who had disappeared being found, torn to pieces without a single drop 
of blood. The most reasonable explanation is that the blood was taken to be 
kneaded into the dough of extremist Jews to be used in matzahs to be devoured 
during Passover." If this is the "most reasonable explanation," can you imagine 
an unreasonable one? But it gets worse. The Matzah of Zion will soon be turned 
into a movie. According to memri, "the producer stated that the primary goal of 
the film is 'to respond to all of the Zionist films distributed by the American 
film industry, which is backed by the Zionist propaganda apparatus. Among these 
films is Schindler's List, which supports the idea of the Jews' right to the 
land of Palestine.'" Schindler's List versus The Matzah of Zion: just a battle 
of ideas.<BR><BR>The sobering truth is that somewhere in my head, I knew all 
this already. It is not a revelation that large segments of the Arab world--at 
all levels of society--are not just anti-Israel, but fanatically anti-Semitic. 
Bernard Lewis wrote in 1986: "The demonization of Jews goes further than it had 
ever done in Western literature, with the exception of Germany during the period 
of Nazi rule. In most Western countries, anti-Semitic divagations on Jewish 
history, religion, and literature are more than offset by a great body of 
genuine scholarship... In modern Arabic writing there are few such 
countervailing elements." So why did I look the other way? Why did I discount 
this anti-Semitism on the grounds that these are alien cultures and we cannot 
fully understand them, or because these pathologies are allied with more 
legitimate (if to my mind unpersuasive) critiques of Israeli policy? I guess I 
was thinking like John Rawls. We in the West simply do not want to believe that 
this kind of hatred still exists; and when it emerges, we feel uncomfortable. We 
do everything we can to change the subject. Why the denial, I ask myself? What 
is it about this sickness that we do not understand by now? And what possible 
excuse do we have not to expose and confront it with all the might we 
have?<BR><BR></BODY></HTML>
