        <LI>The support of universities like Princeton will impact the success 
        of America's war on terrorism. Regardless of where America must fight, 
        the clash of ideas takes place here. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>The September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. were 
        the deadliest acts of aggression ever directed against American 
        civilians. These terrorist attacks open a new chapter in what Winston 
        Churchill called "the dark, lamentable catalog of human crime." 
        <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>Americans of every faith and race are equally victims and equally 
        threatened by terrorist attacks on the United States. On September 11, 
        evil did not discriminate. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>No policy of the United States government could justify these 
        horrific attacks upon innocent civilians. We refuse to legitimize terror 
        as a method of political expression. There is no justification for 
        atrocity. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>We are troubled by attempts to explain the events of September 11 in 
        terms of flaws in American ideals and conduct. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>The treachery of September 11 was not the act of a few deranged 
        individuals. Rather, it was the opening shot in a war, fired by an 
        organization professing deep hatred for the United States and its ideals 
        of liberty, security, and peace. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>The United States still faces the threat of terrorist assault. 
        Terrorism endangers our families, our way of life, our country, and our 
        freedom. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>The aim of terror is to deprive us of our rights and liberties and 
        to replace them with fear. When called upon to defend liberty, the 
        United States has always prevailed. Together we can prevail over terror. 
        <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>Terrorists would understand a failure to respond decisively as an 
        invitation to further violence. Our resolve and patriotism will ensure 
        victory over terrorism. <BR>&nbsp; 
        <LI>If our effort to obliterate terrorism is to succeed, the American 
        people must unite behind their leaders and armed forces. Princeton must 
        lead in this moral struggle. We will preserve and strengthen our 
        freedoms even as we unite in support of our nation. <BR>&nbsp;
