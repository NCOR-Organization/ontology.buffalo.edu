      align=left>ntil the late Middle Ages, the Muslim Middle East was at least 
      as economically developed as Europe. Then, beginning with the rise of the 
      great Italian traders in the 14th century, Europeans pulled ahead, while 
      the Islamic world gradually declined. By the 19th century, European 
      economic influence had translated into political domination of the Middle 
      East. The Islamic world has never fully recovered, and that disparity 
      feeds resentment today.</P>
      <P>What happened? The puzzle is vexing not only because Muslim traders had 
      been so successful in earlier eras but because they remained successful in 
      trade with other regions, like India and East Africa. They were not bad at 
      business; to the contrary, they were good at it.</P>
      <P>This is the sort of big-picture question that interests economists who 
      study "institutions" &mdash; the laws, regulations and norms that provide the 
      underpinnings for economic life. After the work of the Nobel laureate 
      Douglass C. North, these scholars recognize that development does not take 
      place in a vacuum. The institutions that work well for certain types of 
      economic activity may not work as well for others. Discovering new and 
      better institutions is as important as discovering new technologies or 
      business practices. And that trial-and-error process can take time.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Timur Kuran, an economist at the University of Southern 
      California, has been investigating the connection between institutions and 
      the economic decline of the Muslim Middle East. In a paper, "The Islamic 
      Commercial Crisis: Institutional Roots of the Delay in the Middle East's 
      Economic Modernization," he proposes an answer: Islamic partnership law 
      and inheritance law interacted to keep Middle Eastern enterprises small, 
      never allowing the development of corporate forms. (A version of the paper 
      can be downloaded at <A 
      href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=276377" 
      target=new>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=276377</A>.)</P>
      <P>In the Middle Ages, both Islamic and European law required that a 
      partnership dissolve if one partner died or was incapacitated. That tended 
      to limit the size of such arrangements. The typical partnership would be, 
      say, two financial backers and one trader who brought merchandise to or 
      from a distant locale. The more people involved, the more likely the 
      partnership would have to dissolve in the middle of a venture.</P>
      <P>In Europe, the consequences of a partner's death could be limited. 
      Inheritance law often allowed a person to designate heirs. So a particular 
      son might inherit the partnership share. The partnership would still have 
      to dissolve technically, but it could be immediately reconstituted. Even 
      in places where inheritance law was more rigid, heirs were generally 
      limited to the nuclear family, keeping down the number of claimants and, 
      therefore, the potential for disrupting partnerships. As a result, 
      European partnerships were able to expand over time, allowing more 
      ambitious, better-financed ventures.</P>
      <P>Under Islamic law, by contrast, inheritance was prescribed in rigid 
      detail, with all sorts of family members &mdash; uncles, cousins, siblings, 
      parents, and so on &mdash; getting pieces of the estate. There was no way to 
      limit a stake to a single heir. These prescriptions were rooted in the 
      Koran, which meant they were virtually impossible to alter. The 
      fragmentation produced by inheritance law, combined with the strictures of 
      partnership law, kept Middle Eastern enterprises small. That, in turn, 
      limited the pressure to evolve new economic forms.</P>
      <P>"Why did you get the joint stock corporation and the modern corporation 
      in Europe?" Professor Kuran asked. "Because as these partnerships 
      expanded, they created problems that had to be resolved by putting 
      pressure on the legal system to recognize new institutions." For instance, 
      partners who wanted to pull out and sell their shares needed a financially 
      graceful way to do so, leading to transferable shares and stock 
      exchanges.</P>
      <P>"As these problems arise, the legal system responds," Professor Kuran 
      said. "The same thing doesn't happen in the Islamic world because the 
      partnerships don't grow."</P>
      <P>That difference did not matter for a long time, because the small 
      partnerships were still extremely successful, and most of their trade was 
      with Africa or Asia. Only in the 18th century, when trade with Europe 
      became a big part of Middle Eastern commerce, did the difference between 
      the systems become important.</P>
      <P>At that point, Christians and Jews in Islamic countries also suddenly 
      had a business advantage. As religious minorities, they had been able to 
      choose whether to do business under Islamic law or, with mutual consent, 
      under some other law. Although their own religions also provided laws and 
      courts, they generally relied on Islamic law.</P>
      <P>When Europeans started dominating Middle Eastern trade, however, they 
      brought European courts with them. That gave Middle Eastern religious 
      minorities a new option: to use European law. "So," Professor Kuran said, 
      "a local Christian in Istanbul suddenly gets the idea he could start 
      running his business under French law and take his disputes to the French 
      court in the city, and to have his contracts notarized by a French notary, 
      effectively moving under French law. This happens on a very large 
      scale."</P>
      <P>Since European institutions had evolved to better suit the scale of 
      modern businesses, in which thousands of people may be involved as 
      investors and employees, Christians and Jews using those laws began to 
      prosper in comparison to their Muslim neighbors. Only in the 19th century 
      did Middle Eastern governments begin adopting secular commercial laws that 
      allowed Muslim-owned enterprises to grow.</P>
      <P>Today, Professor Kuran says, Islamic inheritance law poses no problems 
      to large- scale endeavors. The estate simply divides up the securities 
      among the heirs, and the business goes on undisturbed. Secular corporate 
      law lets religious inheritance law work in a modern economy.</P>
      <P>"I'm not talking about blanket condemnation of Islamic law," he said 
      emphatically. "That is patently false. I don't believe it and I don't 
      argue it." Rather, he views the situation as an unintended consequence of 
      institutions that were suited for the times in which they developed.</P>
      <P>"When the inheritance law was put into place, the early Muslims in the 
      seventh century were not thinking about the consequences for commerce with 
      Europe 1,000 years later," he said. They were addressing inequities in 
      their own day, including the problems of daughters left with no 
      inheritance. "But in the process," he said, "they created another problem 
      1,000 years down the road."</P></NYT_TEXT><!--plsfield:NYT_FOOTER-->
