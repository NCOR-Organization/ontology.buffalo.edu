 Abstract</p>
  <p> Religious ontologies consist of mentally represented assumptions about
the identity and powers of stipulated supernatural entities and agencies.
Such representations seem culturally specific and it is often assumed that
their variability is unbounded. However, it is possible to identify recurrent
types and to explain the recurrence by using experimental evidence from developmental
psychology. Ontological categories acquired at the earliest stages of conceptual
development constitute an intuitive ontology. This is a limited set of expectations
concerning particular domains of experience. Most religious assumptions gain
psychological salience by violating expectations derived from that intuitive
ontology. One may therefore speculate that there is a limited "catalogue"
of potentially successful religious ontologies. This psychological prediction
can be tested against anthropological evidence for the recurrence of particular
assumptions in diverse cultural environments.</p>

 <br>
 Religious Ontologies and the Bounds of Sense:<br>
 A Cognitive Catalogue of the Supernatural</p>
  <p> <br>
 Religious ontologies seem to display striking cross-cultural differences.
As a result, cultural anthropologists are on the whole rather wary of general
propositions on religious representations. Here I will contend that it is
in fact possible to put forward a general explanatory framework that makes
sense of the apparent variability but also of the recurrent features of religious
representations. This requires that we focus, not just on the categories
as described in anthropological monographs, but also on cognitive processes
underlying their acquisition and representation by individual subjects. Here
I will consider the limited domain of mentally represented ontological assumptions,
that is, partly tacit assumptions concerning the existence and specific causal
properties of supernatural entities. Other types of assumptions are involved
in the representation of religious categories, to do for instance with the
specific powers of particular human agents (priests, shamans, etc.), with
general ideas about ritual action, with particular memories of such actions,
etc. I will leave aside these domains, and show that the ontological assumptions
which constitute the conceptual core of religious representations belong
to a few recurrent types. Their variability is bounded by universal properties
of the human mind which make certain conceptual representations much easier
to acquire than others.</p>
  <p>      The argument here starts from the fact that human minds are predisposed
to build particular types of conceptual structures, from the earliest stages
of conceptual development. These conceptual structures in turn constrain
the inferences produced on the basis of experience and cultural input. In
this way, cognitive processes impose constraints on the range of cultural
representations likely to be acquired, stored and transmitted, and therefore
likely to be found in diverse cultural environments (see Boyer 1994 for a
general presentation). This explains that religious ontologies tend to display
a limited number of recurrent types, why there is a limited "catalogue" of
religious ontological assumptions. My aim here is not to offer yet another
classificatory scheme for religious representations, but to show in what
ways universal properties of human minds limit the range of "culturally viable"
representations.</p>
  <p> <b>1. Varieties of ontological assumptions</b><br>
      An ontology postulates a certain number of kinds of objects in the
world as well as the fundamental properties that differentiate them from
other kinds. Ordinary ontological categories denote such broad domains as
events, physical objects, animate beings, abstract objects, persons, plants,
animals, etc. Obviously, such categories are not just labels for classes
of objects thrown together for no good reason. All ontological categories
are based on (generally tacit) assumptions about the specific characteristics
of the different classes that are distinguished. Similarly, religious categories
are based on a series of assumptions about the existence and the specific
causal powers of various classes of entities. It may be of help at this point
to give a few examples of the type of representations I am talking about,
before dealing with their cognitive underpinnings and their proper theoretical
explanation.<br>
      Let me start with the most common type of religious assumption, which
postulates the existence of non-human agents, clearly marked off from ordinary
human beings. I will take here an example from my own fieldwork, although
the features relevant to the argument are not specific to that particular
case. Among the Fang of Cameroon, the "ghosts" or "spirits" (bekong)  are
commonly characterised as the immaterial presence of dead people (see Boyer
1992; 1994: 91-124 for more detailed descriptions). Some features are central
to the characterisation of the bekong. First, the ghosts have extraordinary
physical properties. They are invisible, probably immaterial, can easily
go through physical obstacles and usually move extremely fast. Also, they
have powers that set them off from most other kinds of beings. They can throw
tiny "darts" at people, which pierce the skin and "thicken" (i.e. poison)
the victim's blood. These powers, and notably the physical properties of
the ghosts, are clearly and explicitly construed as out of the ordinary,
as what makes the category bekong of particular interest.<br>
      <br>
Such intentional agents with extraordinary physical properties, are given
various names in anthropological descriptions (gods, spirits, souls, etc.);
the specific differences should not make us neglect the common features of
the genus, in particular the combination of intentional action with non-ordinary
physical properties. This type of assumption is so common that some anthropologists,
after Tylor, would take it as the most central form of religious representation;
I will return to this point at the end of this paper. The range of possible
religious ontologies is of course not limited to such agents, as the following
examples will show.</p>
  <p>      Another familiar feature of religious ontologies is the assumption
that some inert physical objects have some of the typical properties of animate
beings, among which intentionality is central. Consider for instance W. James's
account of "ebony divination" among the Uduk-speaking peoples of Sudan (James
1988). The main ritual in this recent and successful cult centres on the
interrogation of wands made from branches of ebony. The wands are first kindled
on a fire, and then held over a gourd of water. Divination messages are "read"
in the way the wand burns and in the smudges on the surface of the water.
The crucial assumption here is that the wand gives messages simply by "telling"
what the tree from which it was made, has overheard:<br>
 "It is in the nature of ebony, people say, as it grows wild in the forest
or bush, to 'hear' signals about what is going on in the human world, and
it is these secrets which are revealed in the consultation" (James 1988:
10).</p>
  <p> People assume that this is a particular feature of ebony trees, which
makes them different from other plants:</p>
  <p> "Ebony growing far out in the woodland between the hamlets will know
of grumbling over debts it will know of the actions of the arum [souls, spirits,
including people who were not given a proper burial] and of dhatu/ (witches)
and other sources of psychic activity" (James ibid.: 303).</p>
  <p> The trees are not just dumb recording devices, however. During the
consultation, the ebony stick produces particular smudges in the water; these
not only indicate the nature of the problem at hand, but also a solution,
for instance by directing the diviner to the place where a particular soul
(a "Genius" in James's terminology) is held, separated from the person (James
ibid.: 303-305). The concept of "listening ebony" seems to bridge the gap
between the ordinary, non-religious categories of plant and person: something
that is identified as a member of a particular natural kind is given standard
features of intentional beings: perceptions, thoughts, memories and communicative
intentions.</p>
  <p>      In many cultural environments, this projection is directed at
artefacts. Many religious traditions include some assumptions concerning
the intentional features of particular religious artefacts. As an illustration,
consider for instance this description of shamanistic ritual among the Cuna
of Panama:<br>
 [The shaman's] song is chanted in front of two rows of statuettes facing
each other, beside the hammock where the ill person is lying. These auxiliary
spirits drinks up the smoke, whose intoxicating effect opens their minds
to the invisible aspect of reality, and gives them the power to heal. In
this way [the statues] are believed to become themselves "diviners". From
the Cuna point of view, the shaman ritually regenerates the "power of vision"
of his statuettes. He also speaks both like them and for them their secret
and incomprehensible tongue. (Severi 1993: 231)</p>
  <p>      To turn to another type of assumption, consider the connections
established in some religious systems between biological properties of live
things and the structure of non-live natural objects. In his account of the
religious representations of an Andean community, Bastien for example (Bastien
1978) describes how a particular mountain is construed as a live body, with
a trunk, a head, legs and arms. Different villages, but also valleys, fields
and rivers are described as different parts of the mountain's body. This
spatial metaphor is also relevant to exchanges between the different villages,
and to the organisation of ritual activities. The mountain is represented
as having physiological properties; it "bleeds" for instance, and also "feeds"
on the meat of sacrificed animals that are left in particular places. Sacrifices
of llama's hearts or foetuses for instance are made to the mountain, and
left in special shrines to "feed" its body, supposedly in exchange for the
fertility of the fields.  Diviners "pump [sacrificial] blood and fat, principles
of life and energy, to the rest of the mountain's metaphorical body" (Bastien
1978: 37). A whole domain of ritual acts and explanatory assumptions are
here based on assumptions that transfer properties of live organisms to an
inert natural object.</p>
  <p>      Finally, I must mention a less common, but more spectacular form
of religious speculation, with an excerpt from Metraux's classic analysis
of Voodoo in Haiti:</p>
  <p>  Zombi are people whose decease has been duly recorded, and whose burial
has been witnessed, but who are found a few years later living with a boko
[sorcerer] in a state verging on idiocy. The zombi are the living dead &shy;
corpses which a sorcerer has extracted from their tombs and raised by a process
which no-one really knows [&#352;a zombi] moves, eats, hears what is said to him,
even speaks, but he has no memory and no knowledge of his condition. (Metraux
1959: 280-1).</p>
  <p> This notion in a sense constitutes the converse of the notion of spirits
described above. Spirits are ontologically peculiar in that they seem to
be persons without being physical objects. Zombies have material bodies but
they seem to have lost some crucial properties of persons, notably intentions
and self-awareness.</p>
  <p>      These examples, however cursory, convey some of the conceptual
diversity to be expected in the domain of religious categories. They also
make clear that how ontological assumptions are at the core of such categories.
What makes the Cuna statuettes special, for the Cuna, can be described as
a special combination of features of two distinct ontological categories,
that of artefact (the statuettes are artefacts) and that of person (the statuettes
are described as intentional agents); the same remark applies to the ebony
sticks used in Uduk divination. The Aymara mountain, too, combines features
of two different ontological domains, that of live beings and that of inanimate
objects. Zombies are remarkable in the apparent violation of a central feature
of the category person, possession of self-awareness and volition. The same
applies very generally to concepts of gods and spirits, except that in this
case it is another typical property of person, the possession of a body that
is a solid physical object, that seems to be violated. In each of these examples,
and I would assume in most types of religious categories, it would be difficult
to describe the categories without making use of some broad ontological categories
and their particular combinations. A straightforward consequence is that
we cannot really describe "religious ontologies" unless we have a good description
of non-religious ones. Notions like artefact or animal seem hardly mysterious
or problematic; the cognitive processes whereby they are acquired and represented
may not seem likely to generate difficult problems or indeed great intellectual
wonders. As it happens, familiarity is rather misleading here. As we will
see, the representation of ordinary ontological categories is a rather complex
affair; moreover, it has direct consequences for a plausible explanation
of religious categories and their cultural transmission.</p>
  <p> <b>2. Intuitive ontology in conceptual development</b><br>
      Ontological assumptions are part and parcel of ordinary, everyday cognitive
processes. Even the most trivial activities require a set of fast, automatic
decisions about the identification objects in the environment, as well as
the inferences made about them. Subjects may not, and in fact need not be
aware of  these ontological categories and principles. This is why their
content and organisation can best be revealed by experimental studies, and
by developmental studies in particular. These show how intuitive ontologies
develop early, before subjects can formulate explicit, integrated conceptions
of the types of objects that can be found in the environment. Moreover, such
studies demonstrate the constraining function of intuitive ontologies. They
make conceptual acquisition possible by restricting the range of inferences
that can be made about given objects, by orienting subjects towards certain
preferred inferences.</p>
  <p>      The development of intuitive ontologies requires the operation
of two sets of cognitive mechanisms, which are to a certain extent functionally
distinct. First, there are a number of ontological categories, automatically
and tacitly activated in the identification of objects. These categories
may be perceptually grounded. but this does not mean that their identification
procedure is simple or passive. In order to identify something as animal
or artefact or person, one must pay selective attention to particular features,
but also produce complex inferences on the basis of those features, of their
combination, etc. Second, the output of these categorisation processes activates
a series of modular inference engines, based on domain-specific principles.
These modules specialise in the treatment of particular aspects of objects
found in the environment. For instance, an inference engine delivers expectations
about the future movement of a solid object, given the force applied to it.
Such inference engines are automatically activated and provide the organism
with a range of possible inferences about the objects represented, and therefore
restrict the range of possible beliefs about those objects. What follows
is a very concise summary of the evidence concerning the early development
of ontological categories and inference engines.<br>
      Broad ontological categories correspond to such domains as persons,
artefacts, animate beings, events, abstract objects, etc. There is strong
experimental evidence about the presence of such categories from the earliest
stages of cognitive development, although early categories are probably more
inclusive than adult ones. From infancy, it is quite clear that children
can, like most animals, distinguish con-specifics from other types of beings.
This is made manifest in face-recognition as well as in a series of typical
behaviours and interaction only elicited by the presence of other human beings.
Less obvious ontological categories also appear very early, as for instance
a distinction between animate and inanimate types of objects (Gelman 1983;
Bullock 1985; Richards &amp;  Siegler 1986). This seems to be grounded in
an early sensitivity to the perceptual difference between self- and non-self-generated
movement in physical objects (Massey 1988). With cognitive development, more
refined distinctions appear. For example, Mandler and her colleagues have
demonstrated the existence of a variety of ontological categories such as
plants and artefacts in 18 months children (Mandler 1989; Mandler, Bauer
&amp; McDonough 1991)1.<br>
 <br>
      At a later stage of development, pre-schoolers have a complex hierarchy
of (mostly unlabelled) ontological categories. This is made manifest for
instance by "predicate-spanning" (Keil 1979); if the application of a given
predicate is relevant for a certain object, this allows us to predict the
possibility of applying other predicates to that object. If for instance
an object X, of which we know nothing, is described as "hungry" or "stupid",
we may assume that it makes sense to wonder whether it is "omnivorous". but
we may also assume that it would not make sense to wonder "who made it" or
"how long it lasts". As Keil's studies have shown (1979), pre-schoolers spontaneously
make use of such predicate restrictions to make inferences even about imaginary
objects they know nothing about2. This shows that pre-schoolers have complex
hierarchies of nested ontological categories.<br>
      The identification of objects as members of particular ontological
categories is an automatic, largely unconscious process that is partly based
on complex inferences from perceptual cues. As I said above, such features
as typical movement provide the starting-point of an animate-inanimate distinction;
it is clear that other distinctions (person-animal, plant-artefact) may also
be directed by the child's specific sensitivity to perceptual cues. Ontological
categories, however, are not just a means to sort out objects; they have
conceptual consequences, directing the type of expectations entertained about
different objects. This is why we must describe the way ontological categories
are connected to early "theories" about different aspects of reality.</p>
  <p>      Recent experimental studies of children's early intuitive ontologies
have shown that children's inferences about particular aspects of the experienced
world have two salient features. First, they are to a certain degree under-determined
by experience, and appear much earlier than the child's actual interaction
with the world would lead us to imagine. Second, they are domain-specific,
involving structurally different principles and expectations according to
the aspect of reality they focus on. Generating physical expectations from
the experienced physical behaviour of objects is not done in the same way
as generating biological expectations on the basis of observed biological
features. Experimental studies allow us to describe a variety of domain-specific
conceptual structures (for a general survey, see Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994).
Here I will only mention three structures of particular importance, namely:</p>
  <p>      (1) an intuitive physical module, which produces explanations
and predictions concerned with the physical properties of solid objects;</p>
  <p>      (2) an intuitive biological inference module, which specifies
principles to do with the essential nature of certain biological properties,
and their connection to membership of particular, mutually exclusive and
jointly exhaustive, classes of beings;</p>
  <p>      (3) an intuitive intentional explanation module, which infers
speculative explanations of behaviour in terms of the existence and causal
properties of hidden entities such as beliefs, intentions, perceptions.</p>
  <p>      Let me first consider physical  processes, the domain of the statics
and dynamics of solid objects. There is growing evidence that physical principles
appear much earlier than classical Piagetian models would assume, and certainly
earlier than sensory-motor capacities could warrant. Four months olds for
instance expect solid objects to behave according to a principle of continuity
(objects move in continuous paths) and solidity (objects do not coincide
in space) (Baillargeon 1987; Baillargeon &amp;  Hanko-Summers 1990). Also,
a principle of support (unsupported objects fall downwards) seems to appear
around 6 months (Spelke 1990). Moreover, infants are sensitive to differences
in contiguous events, particularly between causal and non-causal versions
of contiguous physical events; they also hold a principle of "no action at
a distance" (Leslie 1979; 1988). Such early principles form a skeleton on
which more complex notions of physical causation can be then developed. As
Bullock et al. point out, "the development of causal understanding is more
a process of learning where, when and how to apply the rules of [causal]
reasoning rather than figuring out what these rules might be" (Bullock 1982:
216).</p>
  <p>      Another domain of inference concerns specifically biological aspects
of live beings. From the earliest age, there is a categorical distinction
between "animate" and "inanimate" objects. This distinction is then enriched
with a variety of specific intuitive principles which describe biological
aspects of live beings. There are several different kinds of principles at
work in the child's "intuitive biology". First and foremost, there is a taxonomic
principle, following which the space of all species is divided in a number
of mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive natural classes, arranged in a
taxonomy (Atran 1991). Second, the identification of living kinds also activates
an "essentialist principle" following which an undefined internal principle,
which is exclusive to the species, causes the external features of living
objects as well as certain aspects of their behaviour. For instance, even
pre-schoolers assume that membership of a kind is more important than observable
features, in predicting the typical behaviour of an unknown animal (Gelman
1986), (Massey &amp; Gelman 1988; Becker &amp; Ward 1991)3.  These theoretical
assumptions are also manifest in children's reactions to putative scenarios
of artificial transformation from one kind to another. Such changes are judged
more plausible between types of artefacts than from one living kind to another,
even in cases where an animal is described as having gradually acquired the
other's outside appearance or behaviour (Keil 1986). Third, this essentialist
understanding of  living things leads children to evaluate a number of properties
as directly caused by "inner" mechanisms4.<br>
      <br>
Finally, one of the most salient sets of intuitive principles is found in
the intentional explanation of behaviour. From the earliest stages of cognitive
development, children readily interpret the behaviour of animate beings,
particularly persons, in terms of the causal role of unobservable entities,
such as beliefs and intentions. This requires a series of tacit principles
about the nature of mental entities and their connections with observable
action (see for instance Astington, Harris &amp; Olson 1988; Wellmann 1990;
Perner 1991n; Whiten 1991)n. Beliefs and desires are represented as immaterial
entities from the age of three (Wellmann &amp; Estes 1986). At the same age,
children have a rudimentary understanding of the causal connections between
states of affairs and mental representations. They understand that perceptions
routinely cause beliefs which (may) cause intentions which (may) result in
actions, whilst the reverse causal links are non-standard. They also understand,
around the age of four, the possibility for mental representations to misrepresent
actual states of affairs, as well as the behavioural implications of false
belief (see Wimmer &amp; Perner 1983 for the original findings). All these
principles form the transparent, self-evident basis of intentional explanations.
Of course children subsequently acquire vastly more complex notions about
mental processes and behaviour. Yet these notions never contradict the fundamental
principles observed in five year olds.<br>
      Particular activation rues connect the identification of an object
as a member of a particular ontological category and the activation of some
inference engines. For instance, identifying something as an animal results
in the activation of the three modules described above, producing definite
expectations about physical constraints, the possession of species-specific
essential features and the interpretation of the animal's action as caused
by intentions and beliefs. On the other hand, identifying the object as an
artefact does not activate the intentional action or biological properties
modules, whilst the physical one is activated5. The selective activation
of particular inference engines is an automatic process, triggered by ontological
identification. <br>
      The combination of ontological categories and domain-specific inferential
modules provides the child and the adult with what I will call an intuitive
ontology, which constitutes a basis and a constraining system for further
knowledge acquisition. Obviously, knowledge structures could not be developed
without the trigger provided by external stimuli. No child will ever develop
an understanding of intentional action unless she is in constant interaction
with intentional beings; no understanding of biological properties could
develop in a environment that did not include live beings. However, the child's
early or intuitive "theories" go far beyond the information given, and are
structured, from an early age, by complex, quasi-theoretical hypotheses.
Obviously, under-determination by experiential input entails under-determination
by cultural input, which is only a subset of the child's experience. This
is why the principles underlying intuitive ontologies can be found in a similar
form in the most diverse cultural environment. For instance, Walker finds
a similar developmental schedule for aspects of ontological development in
Yoruba and American children (Walker 1985; 1992). Or again, the principles
of taxonomic ordering and essentialist understanding of living things are
represented in similar ways the world over (Atran 1990). The understanding
of mental processes and intentional action, which after all would seem to
depend most on particular social interactions, is seen to undergo the same
developmental phases in Cameroon Pygmy and British children (Avis &amp; Harris
1991). The content and developmental schedule of ontological categories and
domain-specific principles are the outcome of  maturational programmes, triggered
but not shaped by experiential input.</p>
  <p><b> 3. Religious assumptions as counter-intuitive</b><br>
      Returning to the examples of religious ontological assumptions mentioned
at the beginning of this paper, we can now see that they are all based on
assumptions which go against the expectations delivered by intuitive ontology.
They can be called counter-intuitive in that precise sense. The notion of
spirits violates an intuitive expectations concerning the category person,
namely that persons are physical objects, which obey the principles of solidity
or continuity. The notion of a zombie also violates intuitive expectations
for person, in that intentional behaviour inferences, to do with perception,
thought and intention, cannot apply in the expected way. Conversely, the
notion that a statuette or a twig can "hear" what is said in front of them
violates intuitive expectations, in that the ontological category artefact
does not activate inference engines concerned with intentional behaviour;
artefacts are not intuitively construed as having perceptions and thoughts.</p>
  <p>      A first hypothesis, then, is that religious ontologies generally
include counter intuitive assumptions, relative to the expectations derived
from intuitive ontological categories and principles. This quality is not
really unfamiliar to anthropologists, and probably constitutes the intuitive
basis on which we judge that a given set of representations belong to the
"religious" domain. However, the counter-intuitive quality of religious representations
is generally not discussed at much length in cultural anthropology. One important
factor is that we generally tend to consider that apparently counter-intuitive
assumptions are in fact perfectly intuitive, given a set of established cultural
conventions. In other words, we assume that the criteria of the counter-intuitive
might be culturally variable. What is counter-intuitive to you might be rather
intuitive to me. However, this widespread anthropological conception seems
to be based on several types of confusion, among which the following are
particularly important:</p>
  <p>      (i) A confusion between intuitions and reflexive conceptions.
Religious assumptions violate certain intuitive expectations all humans have,
about such things as the physical embodiment of intentional agents, the inevitability
of death and decay, the impossibility of action at a distance, the fact that
living things grow, that dropped objects fall downwards, etc. These expectations
are the outcome of principles which need not be, and in fact are generally
not penetrable to conscious introspection. Only their outcome, in the form
of expectations, is present to consciousness. Now in some (not all) cultural
environments, some people have developed explicit, articulated conceptions
of what is "natural" and what is not, that is, of what entities and processes
constitute the normal working order of the universe. These explicit conceptions
vary from one cultural environment to another. There is no experimental evidence
that such explicit conceptions can dislodge or radically alter intuitive
expectations; there is in fact a lot of evidence to the contrary. What is
claimed here is that religious assumptions include counter intuitive representations
relative to intuitive expectations, and nothing else.</p>
  <p>      (ii) A confusion between the counter-intuitive and the unfamiliar.
In many cultural environments, people are made familiar, from an early age,
with the counter-intuitive characteristics of religious entities. In this
sense, they are not especially "surprised" to hear spirits described as invisible
or gods as immortal. This, however, is orthogonal to the question whether
the assumptions violate intuitive expectations. Intuitive principles, as
I will show below, constitute an early developed, automatically activated
and relatively inflexible system of expectations. Developing familiarity
with counter-intuitive assumptions does not necessarily make them part of
intuitive expectations6.</p>
  <p>      (iii) A confusion between the counter-intuitive and the unreal.
For the people concerned, some features of spirits, ghouls, gods, magical
objects or imaginary animals are counter-intuitive. This, however, does not
imply that they are construed as unreal. If I drop a piece of chalk in front
of my lecture-room audience, and the chalk flies up in the air instead of
falling downwards, this event will be in all likelihood counter-intuitive,
given people's expectations about the physics of solid objects. This will
probably trigger a search for possible explanations; for most of my audience,
this physical event, however counter-intuitive, has really occurred.</p>
  <p>      That religious assumptions are counter-intuitive and construed
as actually true is probably what makes them of particular interest, and
triggers significant cognitive investment on the part of the people concerned.
We often tend to consider that ontological categories, and the relevant inferential
mechanisms, may well be culturally specific. This conception is not only
rather implausible, in the view of the actual experimental data in this domain,
but also paradoxical; it makes it very difficult to account for the obvious
attention-grabbing quality of religious representations. To return to our
examples, consider for instance the Uduk notion of ebony trees as intelligent
voice-recorders. One might want to interpret this as the consequence of a
culturally specific ontology, in which trees like people can remember conversations.
Yet people who hold such beliefs take great interest in the idea that some
trees have such memories, and are totally unimpressed by the fact that people
do. This asymmetry should suggest that the two assumptions ("people remember
what was said in front of them" and "trees remember what was said in front
of them") do not really have the same status. Or, to take a less extreme
example, consider the Aymara of the Andes, who claim that the mountain on
which they live is a live organism, that breathes and eats and digests (Bastien
1978). Again, if the "Aymara ontology" simply assumed that such physiological
features are present in animals, people and mountains, one would not expect
the extraordinary interest in, and ritual constructions about the mountain's
physiology, as opposed to that of people or animals. Not to put too fine
a point on it, these representations attract considerable attention, often
command a high degree of commitment and may trigger powerful emotional responses,
and all this deserves some explanation. Now, whatever that explanation is,
it cannot really be founded on the idea that religious assumptions are "intuitive"
in the cultural environments considered7.</p>
  <p><b> 4. Background principles and inferences</b><b><br>
  </b>      Counter-intuitive assumptions seem to constitute the core elements
of religious categories. It is "constitutive" of spirits to be physically
counter-intuitive, and of gods to have counter-intuitive biological properties.
This is why such aspects are usually central in people's description of their
religious categories, and as a consequence central in anthropological descriptions
as well. But do such descriptions exhaust the cognitive processes actually
involved in representing those categories?</p>
  <p>      People could not acquire religious ontologies, and make inferences
on the basis of the information given by cultural input, without activating
a background of additional representations. These form part of the mental
representation of the religious categories, yet are not described because
they are "transparent" or self evident to both the people concerned and the
anthropologists who describe such representations. This background is built
by tacitly applying to the religious entities or agencies, the intuitive
principles which are not explicitly violated by the information available
from cultural input. For example, in most cultural environments where the
notion of spirits is relevant, these are construed as intentional agents,
as entities with psychological states and processes. Spirits or ancestors
are said to perceive actual states of affairs, to form beliefs on the basis
of those perceptions, to form intentions on the basis of those beliefs and
so on. It is assumed for instance that causal connections obtain from states
of affairs to spirits' beliefs, and from spirits' beliefs to spirits' intentions,
and not in the opposite direction. Also, spirits are implicitly assumed to
think along the lines of certain pragmatic schemes; if the spirits are said
to want p and assumed to know that p cannot be achieved unless q, it will
be inferred that they want q. Principled psychological assumptions are projected
onto the spirits' putative mental states and behaviours.     The point applies
to other types of religious ontologies. The artefacts described by W. James
as "listening ebony" are certainly counter-intuitive in that they are described
as having certain aspects of intentional beings. But one must notice that
these aspects are themselves represented in a way that is not counter intuitive.
As in the case of  spirits, all the assumptions concerning the alleged perceptual
cognitive activities of the religious agencies are a straightforward projection
of ordinary, self-evident understandings of such processes in persons. The
ebony trees have perceptions which are caused by external states of the world,
like human beings. Also, the way the ebony twigs "communicate" with human
beings complies with ordinary, intuitive principles of intentional communication.
Finally, for all its bizarre aspects, even the notion of a zombie includes
a host of non-counter-intuitive assumptions. Zombies are characterised as
persons and this carries the intuitive assumption that they are solid physical
objects, with one definite location in space and with the possibility of
interacting with other objects in accordance with intuitive physical expectations.</p>
  <p>      Background assumptions may seem self-evident, and this is probably
why they are neither explicitly mentioned by the people concerned nor described
by the anthropologist. That they appear self-evident, however, does not mean
that they are causally irrelevant. Without such assumptions, people could
certainly not make sense of any of the statements, anecdotes, displays and
material objects which constitute the cultural input in the religious domain.
One cannot acquire much anything of use, in terms of information about spirits
for instance, unless one assumes a host of complex assumptions about their
psychological, notably cognitive processes. In other cases, these principles
consist in notions of physical properties or biological processes. Background
assumptions allow subjects to make inferences about religious entities, inferences
without which they could not build a coherent conceptual representation of
these entities. Whilst counter-intuitive cues account for the salience  of
religious ontologies, intuitive principles make them learnable. </p>
  <p><b> 5. A succinct catalogue of violations and transfers</b><b><br>
  </b>      This implies that we should be able to make definite predictions
as to the range and variability of religious ontologies. The claim here is
not that religious ontological representations consist in any odd combination
of "something counter intuitive" and "something intuitive". My claim is more
specific and concerns the connection between the assumptions underlying religious
categories and early developed ontological categories and principles. Counter-intuitive
assumptions, which provide the attention-grabbing quality of religious representations,
are counter-intuitive only in the sense that they violate expectations from
intuitive ontology. The various inferences that complete the representations
result from the activation of intuitive ontological principles. But intuitive
ontology comprises a small number of domain-specific inferential engines
applied to a small number of categories, and religious categories constitute
a limited departure from intuitive principles. It follows that there can
only be a limited number of "possible" types of culturally viable religious
ontologies. It should be possible to describe these combinations systematically,
and establish the "catalogue" promised at the beginning of this paper. Obviously,
the point of the enterprise is not to establish distinctions between types,
but on the contrary to show how the apparent variety of religious categories
is in fact constrained, if considered in its proper causal context, that
of intuitive ontology. This is a speculative hypothesis that derives its
plausibility from the psychological evidence but remains to be tested as
an explanation of cultural recurrence.</p>
  <p>      Let us start with the most salient categories and inference modules
of intuitive ontology, that is to say, the categories and modules that seem
to appear from the earliest stages of conceptual development. Here I will
consider five ontological categories: (1) person, (2) animal (exclusive of
human beings), (3) plant, (4) natural object (rocks, rivers, mountains, etc.
which are non-living, non artefactual discrete objects) and (5) artefact.
As for the aspect-specific inference engines, I will consider the three devices
described above, which correspond to different aspects of objects and different
modes of explanation: the physical behaviour, biological properties and intentional
behaviour  inference engines. </p>
  <p>      As I said in the above section, inferences are produced by activating
a particular module, in the representation of an object identified as a member
of a given ontological category. For instance, once something is represented
as a person, all three modules listed above are activated by default. The
default activation links for each ontological category are as follows:</p>
  <p>      &shy; For person: physical behaviour, biological properties, intentional
behaviour;<br>
      &shy; For animal: physical behaviour, biological properties, intentional
behaviour;<br>
      &shy; For plant: physical behaviour, biological properties;<br>
      &shy; For natural object: physical behaviour;<br>
      &shy; For artefact: physical behaviour.</p>
  <p>      Given these categories and inference engines, the point now is
to produce counter-intuitive assumptions, beyond the default activation links.
From the examples mentioned at the beginning, we can see that there are two
possible ways of producing an assumption that violates intuitive expectations.
First, there may be a violation  of intuitive expectations: a particular
representation is entertained, to the effect that the inferences produced
by normally relevant inference modules do not apply to the particular object
considered. This is what makes spirits for instance counter-intuitive. They
are represented (i) as similar to persons in terms of their psychology and
(ii) as different from persons in their physical properties. Another way
of producing counter-intuitive assumptions is what could be called a transfer
 of expectations. An object is represented as belonging to a particular ontological
category, and an inference module is activated, although it is not part of
the modules activated by default for that category. If we imagine that a
statuette can hear what we say or tell us what it sees, we construe the statuette
as an artefact, and apply to the statuette all the intuitive principles usually
applied to the artefact category. But we also apply to the statuette all
the expectations derived from the intentional psychology module. So, in order
to generate a catalogue of counter-intuitive assumptions in this particular
space, we must systematically apply the following principles:</p>
  <p>      (1) for each inference module that is activated by default for
an ontological category, produce a counter-intuitive assumption by introducing
a violation of the expectations generated by that module;</p>
  <p>      (2) for each inference module that is not activated by default,
produce a counter-intuitive assumption by transfer of that inference module.</p>
  <p>      This produces the list of combinations in table [1], which can
be glossed as follows: <br>
      [1] Person with violation of physical expectations. This is activated
in the notions of ghosts, souls and spirits that can be found in most cultural
environments, and were discussed at the beginning of this paper.<br>
      [2] Person with violation of biological expectations. This, again,
is widespread in categories of "gods" or "spirits", represented as persons
whose biological properties are exceptional, being immortal, or feeding on
the smell of sacrificed meat, etc. This is also found in the notion that
mythical heroes have had organs replaced with artefacts. In the Fang epics,
the ancestors make a hero immortal by replacing his liver and heart with
iron organs (Boyer 1988). The Borasana of Colombia say that powerful shamans
can transform into jaguars (Hugh-Jones 1979: 124).<br>
      [3] Person with violation of psychological expectations. This is implied
in the concept of a zombie, represented as having the ordinary physical characteristics
of persons, but with a specific violation of the psychological expectations;
zombies are described as deprived of volition and conscious experience. Construed
as a temporary state, however, this assumption is very commonly found in
the representation of possession states, in which a person is represented
as having no intentional control of his or her actions, including communicative
action.<br>
      [4] Animal with violation of physical expectations. Mythologies the
world over mention invisible animals, combining the ordinary "psychological"
characters of intentional action that are applied by default to animals,
with counter-intuitive physical properties. Among the Fang of Cameroon for
instance, some people claim that the ancestors breed animals, which can suddenly
disappear when hunted by humans (Boyer 1988).<br>
      [5] Animal with violation of biological expectations. The notion of
metamorphoses is of course the most salient illustration of this assumption,
which violates one of the central principles of intuitive biology, postulating
the stability of kind identity. To take but one example, consider the Malay
notion that many animals were once human, or were transformed from other
animal species (Endicott 1970: 29-30). As Kelly &amp; Keil point out, the
range of metamorphoses is constrained by intuitive taxonomic principles (Kelly
&amp; Keil 1985). The cultural recurrence of such transformations seems to
be a function of ontological proximity. Transformations occur within families
more often than between them, rarely go beyond the animal kingdom (e.g. plants)
and almost never from animals or humans to artefacts. Chimeras are another
example of this particular combination.<br>
      [6] Animal with violation of psychological expectations. This does
not seem to be very common in any religious system, although cases of possessed
animals may be an illustration of this counter-intuitive assumption.<br>
      [7] Plant with violation of physical expectations. Some religious systems
assume the existence of invisible plants, e.g. an invisible tree a shaman
must climb to reach the heavens where souls have been taken.     [8] Plant
with violation of biological expectations. This applies to the same cases
as above, when the plants in question are for instance described as eternal,
i.e. not submitted to intuitive expectations of growth and decay.<br>
      [9] Plant with transfer of psychological expectations. The example
of the "listening ebony" described by W. James (see above) is based on this
type of assumption (although some of the people concerned may in fact represent
the ebony twigs used in the divination ritual as artefacts). There are of
course many beliefs concerning the "souls" of particular plants, e.g. the
soul of taro plants among the Orokaiva (Thompson 1949), and these beliefs
in many cases include a transfer of psychological expectations.<br>
      [10] Natural object with violation of physical expectations. This would
be the case for instance of the notions of "floating islands" found in some
Polynesian mythologies.<br>
      [11] Natural object with transfer of biological expectations. Many
religious representations ascribe biological properties to objects such as
mountains or rivers. Mountains for instance may be described as "breathing",
containing "blood" and feeding on sacrifices (see above).<br>
      [12] Natural object with transfer of psychological expectations. Again,
notions of "live" objects such as live mountains are sometimes complemented
with descriptions of the intentional states of these objects, described as
"desiring" certain things or "resenting" certain human actions.<br>
      [13] Artefact with violation of physical expectations. This is involved
when some artefacts are described as invisible, or capable of effects which
violate intuitive physics, such as some forms of action at a distance.<br>
      [14] Artefact with transfer of biological expectations. This is particularly
important and widespread, as breathing or bleeding statues and other such
miracles are found in many religious systems.<br>
      [15] Artefact with transfer of psychological expectations. This, too,
is both important and widespread. Statues for instance listen to humans (and
sometimes answer back). This assumption is also activated in many divination
techniques, in which an artefact is described as the originator of statements,
as giving a particular diagnosis or prescribing a particular course of action.
Together with [1] and [2], this kind of combination can be found all over
the world, and generally at the core of religious representations.</p>
  <p><b> 6. Cognitive equilibrium and the explanation of recurrence</b><b><br>
  </b>      This way of listing possible religious ontologies may appear
unduly abstract. The formulae in this "catalogue" certainly differ from traditional
descriptions of religious ontologies. For one thing, they do not correspond
to traditional categories in the anthropology or history of religion. The
traditional notion of a "god" for instance is split between two assumptions
([1] and [2]), each of which applies equally well to notions of "spirits"
or "ancestors". This is probably not a serious problem, since there is no
agreement in either anthropology or the history of religion as to the precise
extension of such terms. If anything, there is general agreement in cultural
anthropology that such traditional terms are no more than vague glosses of
local categories, convenient as a kind of conceptual short-hand and misleading
as analytical categories. More importantly perhaps, my description is removed
from actual representations in at least three different ways:</p>
  <p>      First, the formulae leave out part of the representations actually
associated with religious ontological assumptions. The "catalogue" lists
underlying ontological assumptions, not the variety of additional details
that accompany them in their actual representation. Fang ghosts for instance,
who induce illness in people by throwing magical darts at them, may seem
rather different from their Victorian counterparts, who seemed mainly interested
in chatting with the living through ouija boards. People who entertain assumptions
about religious agencies do not usually construe them in terms of the "raw"
combinations listed above, but as detailed descriptions that entail these
combinations of assumptions.</p>
  <p>      Second, the catalogue makes a distinction between assumptions
that are often combined in actual representations. In many cultural environments,
religious categories activate more than one of the combinations listed above.
For instance, many concepts of gods or spirits are based on both [1] and
[2], that is, these agencies are made counter-intuitive both by having non-default
physical properties and non default biological properties. Greek gods for
instance have both a non-default physics, being generally invisible, and
a non-default physiology, as they feed on the smell or fumes of sacrificial
meats.</p>
  <p>      Third, some people in some cultural environments may have their
own reflexive notions about their religious ontology, and its connections
with other intellectual domains. This is the case, obviously, for all human
groups where specialised (and usually literate) scholars explicate and codify
various aspects of religious representations. The Greeks did not just have
beliefs about gods, but also a variety of people producing (and arguing about)
descriptions of these beliefs. My list of combinations leaves aside such
aspects and focuses on the connection between intuitive ontology and religious
representations.</p>
  <p>      Far from being problematic, these departures from ordinary descriptions
are in fact a necessary condition for a realistic explanation of cultural
recurrence. Without dwelling too much on general issues of theoretical construction,
we must keep in mind that explanations of cultural representations differ,
not by the extent to which they leave out rich contextual details, but by
the choice of which details are to be left out. For instance, insisting on
the cultural differences between Victorian ghosts and Fang bekong  entails
that we ignore other aspects, like the fact that in both cases the religious
ontology assumes the existence of a class of persons with counter-intuitive
physical properties and non-counter-intuitive mental capacities. In the same
way, we could assume that there is an integrated conception of "spirits"
in which their physical and biological properties are integrated; but then
we would ignore the fact that these counter-intuitive properties activate
different aspects of intuitive ontology. So the question is not whether it
is legitimate to be abstract and reductive, since this is what all theoretically
meaningful descriptions require, but whether this particular type of abstract
description is theoretically productive. The particular list proposed above
is not an absolute classification; it is relevant only in the context of
a particular explanatory account of cultural acquisition.</p>
  <p>      The recurrence of particular features of cultural representations
can be explained in two different ways, which can be called generative and
selective respectively. Generative accounts postulate a common cause for
the occurrence of similar representations. Applied to religious ontologies,
we could assume for instance that certain human motivations lead inevitably
to the development of a notion of spirit or soul; or one could trace such
notions to particular kinds of experience; or, in a more general way, one
might see the "origin" of religion in the need to provide explanations for
phenomena beyond everyday circumstances, as is assumed in intellectualist
models. By contrast, the point of a selective account is that we need not
consider the "origins" of cultural representations; indeed, a similar representation
that is found in different groups may have originated in entirely different
circumstances and for entirely different reasons. What matters in the study
of recurrent features is that not all representations are equally likely
to survive iterated cycles of acquisition and transmission. Some representations
are not easily transmitted or acquired, because they have either a low attention-grabbing
potential, or do not support rich inferences. Other representations, being
particularly easy to acquire or transmit, will be selected by the repeated
cycles of transmission. Religious representations that do not combine intuitive
and counter-intuitive assumptions may be found in some cultural environments,
particularly as speculations produced by imaginative individuals or theologies
transmitted with considerable institutional effort. They will rarely survive
in the form of those stable, widespread sets of mental representations we
call "cultural systems".</p>
  <p>      The argument presented here, as concerns religious ontologies,
is an example of such a selective account. It specifies cognitive conditions
such that, all else being equal, representations which activate the particular
combinations of intuitive and counter-intuitive assumptions listed above
will be more "viable" than others. Religious categories would probably not
survive if they did not include some counter-intuitive assumptions that made
them salient. In the course of social communication, they would be gradually
discarded. Conversely, religious ontologies that make it impossible to activate
the background of intuitive principles would also be discarded, because they
could not trigger inferential processes that would make them memorable or
usable. Specific combinations of counter-intuitive assumptions and intuitive
principles can be described as a cognitive equilibrium. All other things
being equal, cognitive systems such as human minds will tend to make such
states more permanent than others, once they are reached. Or to put it in
converse terms, once such a state is reached, a cognitive system will tend
to deviate from it less than from other states. In the idealised situation
described here, one should expect representations which reach the cognitive
equilibrium to be the ones most easily acquired and transmitted, all else
being equal. This acquisition process also accounts for the recurrence of
similar religious assumptions in very different cultural environments.</p>
  <p><b> 7. Predictions on the properties of religious systems</b><b><br>
  </b>      Whether this explanation is satisfactory, at least as a first
step, can be judged by considering the predictions it implies. Let me briefly
consider four predictions, concerning (1) the relative rarity of religious
ontologies outside the cognitive equilibrium, (2) the trend towards the equilibrium
even in cases where the input is far from it, (3) the relative frequency
of types of ontologies within the list and (4) general features of the acquisition
process.</p>
  <p>      1. The "catalogue" presented here seems to exhaust the variety
of ontologies, in the sense that there do not seem to be any religious ontologies
that are not based on one or several of the combinations listed here. More
specifically, the claim is that the list exhausts the variety of culturally
viable religious ontologies, at least in the standard conditions of an effortless
acquisition. That is to say, although there may be examples of people or
groups that hold ontological beliefs outside this list, the prediction is
that such constructions, barring exceptional effects of outside factors such
as systematic training or political constraints, will not spread. Note that
the claim is not that it is impossible for human minds to conceive other
types of ontologies: philosophers, science-fiction writers or physicists
constantly imagine worlds far removed from intuitive ontology or even from
the simple combinations listed here. These rarely become widely spread "world-views".
On the whole, they remain socially marginal, and often require considerable
effort and institutional support to be acquired.</p>
  <p>      2. Buddhism offers the interesting example of a religious ontology
systematically organised by a scholarly literate group, and obviously very
far from what I described as a cognitive equilibrium. Buddhism is special
in that it puts forth a description of the world that does not  include supernatural
agents, indeed excludes them, and more generally does not include any of
the combinations of assumptions listed here. The prediction of the model
is that such a set of beliefs either would not spread at all outside the
specialised scholars, or else would be "corrected" by non-scholars towards
one of the combinations described here. There would be two parallel transmission
tracks: painstaking learning of non-equilibrium assumptions in a small group,
effortless acquisition of equilibrium assumptions in the larger population.
This is indeed a consistent finding of all anthropological studies of Buddhism
"on the ground", in which people readily postulate the existence of various
superhuman agents, with all the standard default intentional properties.
In the same way, compare the popular spread of different aspects of Christianity:
most believers hold those beliefs that correspond to equilibrium points,
like the invisible presence of God (combination [1]) or immaculate conception
([2]). By contrast, the unity of Trinity does not seem to be part of the
core representations of most believers, although scholarly theologians view
it as a fundamental tenet of the system.</p>
  <p>      3.  The cognitive model presented here states that religious assumptions
are likely to be acquired and transmitted inasmuch as (i) they have some
attention grabbing potential (given by violations of intuitive expectations),
and (ii) they have some inferential potential (provided by the default background
assumptions). One may want to push this argument further; since both attention-grabbing
potential and inferential potential are variables, their variation should
result in variable salience of religious ontologies. All else being equal,
some combinations of assumptions would be more salient than others. They
would be more likely to attract an individual's attention, and probably better
remembered than other combinations. One would therefore expect those combinations
to be more easily transmitted from one generation to the next; for the same
reason, one would then expect them to be more widespread in different cultural
environments. Now, if we return to the "catalogue" presented above, it is
rather clear that the combinations listed are not equally widespread across
cultural environments. For instance, one can expect to find the following
combinations: </p>
  <p> [1] Person with violation of physical expectations. or <br>
 [2] Person with violation of biological expectations. and <br>
 [15] Artefact with transfer of psychological expectations  <br>
 in practically every religious ontology, whilst<br>
 [3] Person withviolation of psychological expectations <br>
 or<br>
 [6] Animal with violation of psychological expectations </p>
  <p> are rather uncommon, and rather marginal in the groups where they are
found. This is a familiar aspect of religious ontologies. The most frequent
type of religious assumption by far is the postulation of intentional agents
which are counter intuitive either because they have counter-intuitive physics,
or because they are actual artefacts or material objects. This is so widespread
and central that such assumptions are often considered the defining feature
of "religion". There seem to be many common-sense reasons why postulating
intentional agents is more "productive" than imagining, for instance, disappearing
rocks or eternal trees. We could say that intentional agents seem more similar
to us, are more relevant to human interests, could be more productive for
the explanation of mysterious occurrences, and so on. But all these "explanations"
are question-begging, for they presuppose the very familiarity they purport
to explain.</p>
  <p>      The salience of intentional agents may be easier to explain in
a cognitive framework. As I said above, the model presented here predicts
that religious ontologies should be transmitted and therefore recurrent as
a function of (i) their attention-grabbing potential and (ii) their inferential
potential. Now we do not really have as yet precise data about the relative
attention-grabbing potential of various ontological violations, although
this could be easily evaluated in terms of effects on attention and memory.
On the other hand, we have ample evidence, particularly from developmental
studies, of the differences of inferential potential between domain-specific
inference engines. The domains of domain-specific expectations (e.g. biological
aspects of live beings, intentional psychology, physical constraints) are
not equally complex in the range of expectations delivered, nor are they
equally prepared to cope with variable situations. In particular, one must
notice that the "theory of mind" inference engine delivers more complex expectations
than for instance the principles underlying people's intuitive physics. Also,
the explanations produced are invariably of an abductive format, which makes
each cause compatible with indefinitely many effects. And a theory of mind
module deals with a domain in which the causally relevant states and events
(perceptions, beliefs and intentions) are all invisible. All these features
make it likely that combinations of assumptions which either maintain the
activation of a theory of mind module or transfer its expectations to a new
domain should be found more often. This is only a sketch of a speculative
explanation; but the main point here is that the explanation is based on
independent evidence and does not involve circular claim that intentional
agents are intrinsically more "interesting" than other types of counter intuitive
entities.     4. Inference-engines are activated automatically, and produce
stable inferences, on the basis of cues about the ontological categories
objects belong to. If the cultural input gives some cue that a particular
religious agency is a person, then all the inference engines that are not
explicitly excluded will be activated. So no-one needs to be told that spirits
for instance form beliefs on the basis of their perceptions, or intentions
on the basis of their beliefs, but not conversely. Such inferences are automatically
produced by a "theory of mind" module if that module is activated. All that
is needed, in order to generate these particular inferences, is some cue
that indicates, either that intentional inferences are relevant, or even
more simply the absence of any cue that specific ally excludes its activation.
More generally, if religious ontologies are represented in the way described
here, it follows that acquiring them does not require the transmission of
complex, fully-specified "theories", "world-views" or "conceptual schemes".
All that is required is (i) some cues as to the ontological identity of the
objects postulated, and (ii) some cues as to which parts of intuitive ontology
are violated or transferred. Beyond this, the spontaneous activation of intuitive
inference modules should be sufficient to build a representation of the religious
entities postulated. This predicted mode of acquisition is consistent with
what cultural anthropologists report. In most cultural environments, there
is no explicit or observable "learning" of the properties of religious agencies;
in cases where there is some explicit transmission, the particular assumptions
people share vastly exceeds what is being explicitly transmitted. The present
model of religious ontologies explains this without implying that culture
is "in the air" or mysteriously transmitted in indirect ways. Here the assumption
is that most shared representations are not transmitted at all, but spontaneously
inferred by members of the group exposed to similar cues. The process would
result in roughly similar results in most members of a social group because
the inferential modules are similar in their principles, because everyone
shares the same intuitive ontology. </p>
  <p><b> 8. Conclusion</b><b><br>
  </b>      Recurrent religious representations are often described in the
anthropological literature in the form of inductive generalisations on the
basis of ethnographic descriptions. This method is, unfortunately, both indispensable
to further research, and fraught with difficulties. One central and obvious
problem is that such generalisations are not, as we would like to believe,
a-theoretical and data-driven, but theory-laden in a way that is either not
perceived or found too "natural" to deserve a justification. The point of
a cognitive account is to integrate observed recurrence in an explicit causal
framework. The hypothesis is that biases that favour certain types of representations
are amenable to experimental studies, and that they probably have an important
effect on the distribution of representations in a population, across groups
and across generations. In other papers, I have shown how this type of description
allows us to understand the particular conceptual structures built upon religious
ontologies (Boyer 1993), their link with special social categories (Boyer
1994: 155-184), or the way they are used in causal understandings of particular
occurrences (Boyer 1992; 1995). This does not in any way entail that the
cognitive processes described are exclusively found in what we usually call
"religious" systems. Indeed, the notion of "religion" is not really used
here, except as a rough delineation of a set of problems. It is an empirical
question, whether the kind of "cognitive equilibrium" described here is relevant
to the explanation of other domains of cultural representations.</p>
  <p>      The relevance of this particular account depends on (i) the experimental
evidence for the specific cognitive processes described, and (ii) its capacity
to predict distributions of cultural phenomena that approximate the actual
distributions. As far as the first point is concerned, the model is based
on cognitive claims which are both explicit and empirically supported. As
for cultural recurrence, the model is founded on a ceteris paribus clause.
This model postulates that the representation of particular combinations
of counter-intuitive and background intuitive assumptions is an important
factor, in predicting the "cultural survival" of religious ontologies. This
does not imply that other factors are non-existent, but only that in the
long run, all these additional conditions being varied, the trend will favour
assumptions based on the combinations described here, a claim that is supported
by their recurrence in religious systems the world over.</p>
  <p>      One central point of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason was to demarcate
the domain of concepts and intuitions that can be represented by human minds,
by virtue of their constitution. The inquiry would therefore describe what
Strawson (1966) called the "bounds of sense", beyond which there could be
no contentful concept or intuition. There is in anthropology, as in other
disciplines, a widespread tendency to assume that religious concepts are
located, as it were, beyond the bounds of sense, in a domain of unconstrained
imagination, limited only by social and historical constraints. This anti-Kantian
conception would imply that cognitive constraints are, on the whole, irrelevant
to the explanation of religious representations. The aim of the present cognitive
account is to show exactly the opposite. Given a particular cultural input,
people develop complex conceptual structures by an accumulation of spontaneous
non-demonstrative inferences, which are strongly constrained by the content
of intuitive principles. These principles result from evolved properties
of their brains which delimit the "bounds of sense" and in consequence the
bounds of non-sense.</p>

  <p>Notes<br>
  </p>
  <p>*This paper was prepared while I was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford. The research was supported by
a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. McArthur Foundation, grant #8900078.
I wish to thank Tom Lawson, Carlo Severi, Michael Houseman, Dan Sperber and
Sheila Walker for their comments on previous versions.</p>
  <p> 1     These results are important in that they go against a widespread
assumption, that "superordinate" ontological categories are gradually constructed
by abstracting from lower-level "basic" categories. That is to say, we tend
to assume that children first acquire such concepts as "dog", "car" and "orange",
and then abstract some of their features to build a representation of animal,
artefact and plant. This "bottom up" account of conceptual acquisition seems
supported by the fact that the earliest linguistic categories acquired and
used by children do indeed correspond to such "basic" categories. Experimental
evidence, however, seems to suggest that unlabelled, higher order ontological
categories are available to the child before she acquires natural language,
and probably make the acquisition of basic terms easier.</p>
  <p> 2     Some experiments for instance show that young children are confident
that an imaginary item, described as "sleepy", may well be "furious", but
that it is certainly cannot be "made of metal" (Keil 1986).</p>
  <p> 3     Also, they assume that such kind-based inductive generalisations
are more plausible if the properties projected are "inherent" properties
of the exemplars, e.g. ways of breathing and feeding, rather than weight
or speed (Gelman &amp; Markman 1987 passim, see also S. Gelman 1988).</p>
  <p> 4     The inheritance of particular external features, and that of
colour for instance are not attributed to external physical causes; growth,
too, is understood by the pre schooler as a lawful, internally generated
process that is specific to living things (Springer &amp; Keil 1989, 1991).</p>
  <p> 5     By default, identifying something as an artefact implies that
the psychological and the biological module are not activated. Obviously,
other modular structures may be activated, which would be irrelevant to live
things. For instance, artefacts are commonly represented in a way that provides
non-trivial abductive explanations of structural features in terms of the
intended normal function of each part of the artefact. This is, by and large,
irrelevant to the present argument.</p>
  <p> 6     Conversely, the fact that a situation is extremely unfamiliar
does not ncecessarily make it counter-intuitive in th precise sense used
here. If I see a giraffe being thrown out of a window in the House of Commons,
swimming in the Thames to the Embankment and running away from people, this
occurrence may be rather unfamiliar, but does not violate my expectations
about solid objects (falling downwards), live beings (that generally try
to avoid un unfamiliar milieu, like water for giraffes) and intentional beings
(the giraffe intends to avoid people because it fears them).</p>
  <p> 7     To add one final, a contrario argument, let us suppose for the
sake of argument that the criteria of "intuitiveness" are indeed culturally
specific (against all the experimental evidence). Let us also imagine that
some Westerners, armed with their supposedly "Western" criteria of intuitiveness,
create a religious system based on assumptions like the following: that objects
dropped will fall downwards, that people have thoughts and feelings, that
mountains are solid inanimate objects, that a good deal of misfortune happens
by pure chance, that dead men do not talk, and so on&#352; I do not suppose anyone
will want to bet too much on the cultural success of this truly innovative
religious system. This crude thought-experiment does not constitute a sufficient
argument, but it highlights a simple point: the notion that religious ontologies
are not counter-intuitive for the people who hold them, generates a difficult
problem when we want to account for their attention grabbing nature.</p>
