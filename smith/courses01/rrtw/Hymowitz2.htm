            face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size=-1>mid the intense and 
            reassuring outpouring of patriotism in the aftermath of September 
            11, the discordant notes on the political and cultural Left were 
            easy to discount. Polls showed 90 percent-plus support for the 
            president; the numbers favoring sustained military response were 
            nearly as high. The bipartisan backing of administration policy was 
            unprecedented, and the public soberly understood the gravity of the 
            challenge. Yet there's reason to worry that, as the shock wears off 
            and the costs of war mount, the voices of those who would deny 
            America's moral authority to defend itself will grow more insistent 
            and will confront us with a different kind of danger.
            <P>The two main stripes of critic seem stuck in the ideas of the 
            sixties. There are the blame-America-firsters, of course, who regard 
            vigorous self-defense as the moral equal of terrorism. But possibly 
            more insidious are the many who might be called moral lethargists. 
            Offspring of the therapeutic culture, New Age spiritualism, and an 
            entrenched multiculturalism suspicious of Western values, these so 
            resist passing judgment that they shrink from seeing even murderous 
            Islamic fundamentalism as the evil it is and shy away from the tough 
            steps needed to crush it. Though relatively small, these two groups 
            cluster in the powerful opinion-forming institutions: the academy, 
            the liberal churches, the press, and the entertainment media. Unable 
            to grasp the nation's peril and the fragility of the freedoms that 
            allow their voices to be heard, disdaining the idea of common 
            purpose, they share a smug certitude in their own orthodoxy that 
            augments their strength.
            <P>The struggle against our ivory-tower naysayers is surely 
            winnable, and it has never been easier to see them clearly for what 
            they are. But we should not underestimate their power. For our 
            adversaries surely understand what many Americans do not: that the 
            resolve to maintain our common purpose is our greatest 
            vulnerability.</FONT>

            size=-1>ollowing the September 11 attack, the surge of unembarrassed 
            patriotism and revulsion at the vileness of the perpetrators that 
            overwhelmed the nation also swept across most American campuses. 
            Still, at others, for many the grief gave way almost at once to the 
            impulse to "understand" the terrorists' motivations and to assert, 
            in very nearly these words, that America had it coming. It was as 
            if, in the wake of Pearl Harbor, the America First Committee, rather 
            than disbanding, as it did, seized the opportunity to explain how 
            American economic policies in the Far East had provoked the 
Japanese.
            <P>The words of some academic apologists were so poisonous in their 
            moral blindness that a quick review of the college press a week 
            after the event was enough to send one's blood pressure soaring. 
            "It's easy to denounce the terrorism of one's enemies," a reporter 
            for the campus <I>Minnesota Daily</I> declared. "It is far more 
            difficult, but far more necessary, to denounce the terror of one's 
            own government and actively work to stop it." "I am terrified . . . 
            and furious," wrote a Columbia student in the college paper the 
            Spectator. "My leaders fund mass murder in the name of my material 
            well-being." "We're linking the fight against racism to a racist war 
            abroad," a University of Michigan student told the <I>Michigan 
            Daily</I>.
            <P>Most often, faculty and administrators took the lead. The morning 
            after the attack, the <I>Yale Daily News</I> printed, in contrast to 
            a student-written editorial calling for this generation to answer 
            the call to serve "in the armed services, in the intelligence 
            branches, alongside our military strategists and elected leaders," a 
            parade of short pieces by history and political-science faculty 
            sounding the soon-to-be familiar warnings that, as one put it, 
            "retaliation breeds retaliation" and, in the words of another, that 
            the terrorists' appalling acts had to be seen "in context."
            <P>Most of these clueless academics are stuck in the past, living on 
            "the dregs of the sixties," as political-science professor Stephen 
            Smith puts it. "Most tenured faculty were undergraduates during the 
            anti-Vietnam period, and have continued to wear that stance as a 
            kind of protective moral armor. It is so much a part of who they are 
            and what they stand for that it's psychologically and intellectually 
            impossible for them to see the world in any other terms," Smith 
            judges.</FONT>

            in the weeks after the attack featured tenured radicals spouting 
            decades-old themes of Amerika-hatred. We are, proclaimed University 
            of North Carolina sociology professor Charles Kurzman, "playing into 
            the hands of our own militarists, whose interests always lie, I 
            believe, in the exaggeration of threats, armed responses, and so on. 
            In fact, I would argue that there is tacit collusion among the 
            militarists of all sides." The terrorists' acts, added University of 
            Texas journalism professor Robert Jensen, were "no more despicable 
            than the massive acts of terrorism</FONT><FONT

            government committed during my lifetime." 
            <P>Nor was it only obscure academics who seized the moment to say 
            things that most Americans instantly recognize as obscene. At 
            Columbia (to focus on but one Ivy League campus), the two biggest 
            celebrities on the liberal-arts faculty stepped forth to spew venom. 
            "I'm not sure which is more frightening," said the DeWitt Clinton 
            Professor of History Eric Foner, last year's president of the 
            American Historical Association and author of a text that is 
            required reading in countless high school and college classrooms, 
            "the horror that engulfed New York City or the apocalyptic rhetoric 
            emanating daily from the White House."
            <P>Meanwhile, in the London <I>Observer</I>, English department 
            superstar Edward Said scornfully noted the increased stature in the 
            post-attack period of "Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a normally rebarbative 
            and unpleasantly combative figure. . . . " Some days later, it came 
            to light that Said had gone on in the version of the piece that 
            appeared in the Egyptian daily al-Ahram to characterize the mayor as 
            a "retrograde figure, known for his own virulently Zionist views. . 
            . . " This sleight of hand should come as no surprise to anyone 
            familiar with Said's corrosive career. His own autobiography runs 
            over with distortions and fabrications designed to establish his 
            bona fides as a displaced Palestinian victim, and his supremely 
            influential literary criticism, one of the primary sources for the 
            politicized multiculturalism and post-colonialism that have 
            corrupted the teaching of the humanities in America, twists and 
            distorts the meanings of literary and cultural works with one end in 
            mind: to portray the West as the root of all evil.
            <P>As for Columbia president George Rupp, he produced a 
            mealy-mouthed statement after the attack, urging that we "be on 
            guard that we do not in turn also become instruments of hatred or 
            captives of a self-delusion that prevents our acknowledging how 
            others view us." But he had not a word of reproach for Foner or 
            Said.</FONT>

            size=-1>till, it is one thing to encounter such visceral disdain for 
            one's country by one's fellow citizens in print, and quite another 
            to see it up close and personal. Attending an antiwar rally at 
            Connecticut's Wesleyan University on September 20, among 146 held 
            that day across the nation, watching administrators and faculty 
            troop to the podium and fail, even at such a moment, to see evil for 
            what it is or to recognize the blessings of Western pluralism, one 
            got a chilling sense of just how out of touch with reality such an 
            institution has become.
            <P>The speakers represented the entire spectrum of leftist 
            approaches to the earth-shattering event. Indira Karamcheti, a 
            professor of American studies and English, declared: "We need to 
            understand that the events that happened last Tuesday must be placed 
            within their historical context. . . . There is a long history here 
            we need to understand, not least the long history of resistance to 
            imperialism, in which violence has been seen and often lauded as the 
            most effective means with which to resist. Violence and guerrilla 
            tactics are the tactics of the powerless. It's a system in which 
            ordinary objects can be transformed into weaponry . . . and it has 
            historical paradigms, not least in the American Revolution, the 
            Black Panthers, the Algerian Revolution."
            <P>But the comparison between the homicidal Black Panthers and the 
            Founding Fathers was not the low point of the occasion. Jonathan 
            Cutler of the sociology department began his remarks with the Arabic 
            greeting <I>Salaam Alechem</I></FONT><FONT

            size=-1>but he quickly apologized, noting that as a non-Muslim he 
            hadn't the right to use the phrase, and he had no wish to "mirror 
            the global U.S. arrogance of familiarity in the world, that doesn't 
            notice difference, that doesn't care to notice difference." As a

            size=-1>not because they're not terrorists, but because they're the 
            tip of the iceberg of a very big war; we just didn't know the war 
            was going on until then. I really think we have been missing the 
            anger toward the United States for so long, and operating in a world 
            as if it didn't matter that there is a global movement of resistance 
            to U.S. dominance. Now, I don't like the <I>form</I> of the movement

            much of the resistance to globalization. I love New York. But this 
            much I do know: if there is no justice, there will be no peace."
            <P>Then there was Gary Comstock, a sociology professor who is also 
            the university chaplain, still clinging to the make-love-not-war 
            philosophy. As the nation confronted an implacably murderous enemy, 
            he offered these insights: "I think that the inability to love is 
            the central problem, because that inability masks a certain terror, 
            and that terror is the terror of being touched. And if you can't be 
            touched, you can't be changed; and if you can't be changed, you 
            can't be alive." Comstock went on to demonstrate his Ivy bona fides 
            by describing how he had felt moved to turn, in this emergency, to 
            "what I call my elders," including "the late author James Baldwin, a 
            black man who was outspoken before the civil rights movement and a 
            gay man who was &lsquo;out' before the gay liberation movement."</FONT>

            slavery, or torture political dissidents. In earlier generations, 
            the schools, the workplace, the entire society, pushed immigrants 
            toward assimilating into the great American "melting pot." But as 
            multiculturalism took hold, to require immigrant children to learn 
            English, or be taught about the specialness of American history and 
            the greatness of the ideas of the Founding Fathers, or to pledge 
            allegiance to the flag came to seem a sign of gross cultural 
            insensitivity, even of racism. 
            <P align=left>Multiculturalism explicitly disdains the notion of a 
            coherent American identity and, while celebrating almost all symbols 
            of ethnic and racial pride, winces at all displays of U.S. national 
            feeling or unity. After the September 11 attack, a Florida Gulf

            feel like they're looked at differently because they come from

            <P>But while multiculturalists believe absolutely in their own moral 
            purity, they have utterly corroded the bases for most other sorts of 
            moral judgments. They argue that each of us knows the world only 
            through the eyes of his own specific culture, race, and gender. As a 
            result, we cannot know truth, only the particular values that claim 
            to be true within our own culture. Not only is impartial moral 
            inquiry impossible; it is a rationalization for those who would use 
            their "truth"</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"

            <P>The moral paralysis these ideas have caused is blatantly obvious 
            on college campuses. Writing in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
            Education</I>, one teacher of creative writing at Pasadena City 
            College described a class discussion of Shirley Jackson's "The 
            Lottery," in which students refused to judge the stoning of a 
            village resident because they believed human sacrifice might be part 
            of the villagers' religion. One student explained: "We are taught 
            not to judge</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" 
            color=#000000 size=-1>—</FONT><FONT 
            face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size=-1>and if [stoning] 
            has worked for them," we can't condemn it. In another article in the 
            same journal, a Hamilton College philosophy professor noted that his 
            students were reluctant to judge Hitler, apartheid, and slavery. "Of 
            course I dislike the Nazis," one student observed, "but who is to 
            say they are morally wrong?"
            <P>If one can't judge Nazism morally repugnant, it's easy to ascribe 
            to murderous terrorists understandable and even valid reasons. 
            Aren't Islamist radicals expressing their own cultural truth?
            <P>If, as Steven Balch of the conservative National Association of 
            Scholars observes, "we have yet to see how much damage a quarter 
            century of miseducation has done," we can get a pretty good idea 
            listening to the lone student speaker at the Wesleyan rally, a young 
            man named Sajjadur Rahman of the Student Unity Network. Though he 
            was introduced as having lost two relatives in the attack, once 
            Rahman began speaking it was hard to summon up much sympathy for 
            him. "So many have died," he said, early on in his rambling talk, 
            "through acts of war perpetrated by a few individuals for their own 
            selfish needs. I'm not a supporter of bin Ladin. To me, he's the 
            same as George Bush: another millionaire fighting for his own 
            oil."</FONT>

            multiculturalism normally takes a much subtler form than this overt 
            anti-Americanism. Not that you don't find a stiff dose of 
            America-bashing there, but it comes from the usual suspects and is 
            unlikely to convince many beyond the already-converted. After 
            September 11, there was much talk on NPR about "root causes" and the 
            "cycle of violence"; the ever-predictable Katha Pollit, just one of 
            many in <I>The Nation</I> seething over what they see as Americans' 
            supposedly mindless patriotic excess, wrote of her disgust when her 
            daughter asked for an American flag; aged leftist <I>enfant 
            terrible</I> Susan Sontag infuriated even many <I>New Yorker</I> 
            readers with her demand to know, even as the rubble was smoldering, 
            "Where is the acknowledgment that this was not a &lsquo;cowardly&rsquo; attack 
            on &lsquo;civilization&rsquo; or &lsquo;liberty&rsquo; or &lsquo;humanity&rsquo; or &lsquo;the free world&rsquo; but 
            an attack on the world's self-proclaimed superpower, undertaken as a 
            consequence of specific American alliances and actions?"
            <P>In fact, when some high-profile journalists sounded as if they 
            cared more about Muslims, foreign and domestic, than about 
            non-Muslim Americans, they caught flak from other mainstream 
            journalists. The <I>New York Post</I>'s Andrea Peyser rapped the 
            knuckles of CNN's Christiane Amanpour, long aggressively pro-Arab, 
            for saying: "The issue of the United States' close alliance with 
            Israel, the perception that the United States does not care as much 
            about the suffering of Muslims, in Palestine, in what they call 
            Palestine, is a key reason for the anti-Americanism on the rise in 
            the Middle East"</FONT><FONT

            size=-1>though Palestine exists only in the minds of Palestinians 
            and their sympathizers. Similarly, ABC's Peter Jennings, a former 
            Middle East hand widely viewed as tilting toward the Arabs, drew 
            fire from the <I>Washington Post</I>'s Tom Shales when the 
            newscaster's first impulse after the president's historic address to 
            Congress was to interview the Muslim chaplain at Georgetown, as if 
            to say that "the burning question of the moment was whether Bush had 
            come out strongly enough against bigotry toward people of Islamic 
            faith," as Shales interpreted it.
            <P>And more than a few journalistic jaws dropped on this side of the 
            Atlantic when Stephen Jukes, global news editor for the British news 
            service Reuters, ordered his reporters to excise the word 
            "terrorist" from their coverage of the attacks. "One man's terrorist 
            is another man's freedom fighter," wrote Jukes in an internal memo. 
            "We abstain from judgment and believe the word 'terrorist&rsquo; is a 
            loaded term." As Fox News's Fred Barnes put it: "What does Reuters 
            want to call these people? Activists?" As Barnes went on to point 
            out, if Reuters feels a need to equivocate to protect its reporters, 
            the company should pull them out. In fact, of course, those 
            countries would bend over backward to prevent that: they rely on a 
            sympathetic Western press to show the world their casualties and the 
            children they line up as human shields in front of the potential 
            targets of American bombs.</FONT>

            size=-1>lmost certainly, then, the days are over when the <I>New 
            York Times</I> would print, as it did on the very morning of 
            September 11, a sympathetic interview with former Weatherman Bill 
            Ayers, promoting a book subtitled <I>The Making of a Terrorist</I>. 
            "I don't regret setting bombs," Ayers told the <I>Times</I>, 
            reflecting on his group's own long-ago bombing of the Pentagon. "I 
            feel we didn't do enough." Since the Twin Towers massacre, in fact, 
            the <I>Times</I> has published more than a few full-throated 
            expressions of patriotism and calls to moral fortitude. Columnist 
            Thomas Friedman, for one, declared that, "War alone may not solve 
            this problem, but neither will social work. . . . Every state has to 
            know after September 11, harboring anti-U.S. terrorists will be 
            lethal."
            <P align=left>Still, the wish to "understand" the terrorists, to 
            extenuate, perhaps to hold them harmless from reprisals and to 
            lessen the moral distance between them and their victims, persists 
            in ambivalent tension with the patriotism. A striking example comes 
            from the <I>Hartford Courant</I>, Connecticut's largest daily, in 
            its coverage of the Wesleyan rally. Willfully ignoring the rally's 
            extreme anti-Americanism, the paper edited out Sajjadur Rahman's 
            equation of bin Ladin and George Bush but lauded the Wesleyan 
            student as a moral exemplar. "Two of his relatives were killed in 
            the World Trade Center last week," began the long article, headlined

            Thursday." 
            <P align=left>The <I>Courant</I> editors clearly share the 
            sympathies of their reporter: strategically placed beneath the 
            paper's account of President Bush's historic speech to Congress the 
            previous evening, ran a story on a woman whose husband died in the

            " &lsquo;I don't want my children to have to go to war to avenge their

            over the long term to weaken the nation's resolve. And in this vein,

            obsessive themes: racism, in the form of bias crimes against Arabs; 
            and threats to civil rights, in the form of criticisms of those

            the evils of American racism, sexism, and homophobia. Certainly 
            there is nothing in the lethargist's philosophy that could dream of 
            Islamist holy warriors bent on destroying them and their 
            civilization, rejoicing as they incinerate thousands at a blow. 
            <P>Many entertainers advised fans to stick with their pre-September 
            11 focus on self-actualization rather than on civic affairs. Oprah 
            Winfrey told the vast crowd at a Yankee Stadium prayer service: 
            "What really matters is who you love and how you love." Madonna's 
            message, too, was one of narcissistic self-regard barely disguised 
            as principled pacifism. "Violence begets violence," she warned a Los 
            Angeles audience. "I don't know about you, but I want to live a 
            long, happy life. I want my kids to live a long, happy life." That 
            her children's lives were under attack seemed not to occur to her. 
            "I said it last night, and I'll say it again," she declared, 
            sounding like the chaplain at Wesleyan, "if you want to change the 
            world, change yourself." 
            <P>In a TV tribute to John Lennon to benefit families of the Twin 
            Towers rescue workers, among others, Yoko Ono told a cheering crowd: 
            "John always said, &lsquo;There are no problems, only solutions.&rsquo; " The 
            program offered some of those solutions: "Think of your children. Do 
            you want war and them to be killed, or not? That's the choice we 
            have, between war and peace." By the time a rock group sang the 
            Beatles' refrain "Nothing's Gonna Change My World," it seemed likely 
            that this sentiment will remain the entertainment industry's

            approvingly, philosophers and theologians were worried that casting 
            the fight against global terrorism as a crusade of good against evil 
            would make Americans "feel not only morally alive, but morally 
            superior."
            <P>A contrast seems in order, this one involving the words written 
            by Msgr. James H. O'Neill, chief chaplain of the Third Army, when 
            George Patton called upon him during the Battle of the Bulge to pray 
            for good weather, so that American planes might bomb the German 
            forces besieging Bastogne. "Almighty and most merciful Father," he 
            complied, "grant us fair weather for Battle. Graciously hearken to 
            us as soldiers who call upon Thee that, armed with Thy power, we may 
            advance from victory to victory, and crush the oppression and 
            wickedness of our enemies and establish Thy justice among men and 
            nations." </FONT>

            students are for the first time in decades learning the words of 
            "America the Beautiful" rather than "We Are the World," many 
            educators, wedded to a therapeutically tinged multiculturalism, were 
            reluctant to help the next generation come to grips with their 
            country's watershed moment. Under the title "Dealing with September 
            11th," the New York City Board of Education, for instance, offered 
            teachers a curriculum in the form of recommended Web sites. Don't 
            look for any information on Islamic fundamentalism or Usama bin 
            Ladin, though. According to the board, what students need to learn 
            largely falls under the headings "Promoting Tolerance" and "Mental 
            Health"</FONT><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT"

            therapeutic agenda. The board listed only four sites under what it 
            called "Social Studies" and "Government," and these were on the 
            order of "e-pals"</FONT><FONT

            size=-1>"e-mail exchange opportunities to promote understanding." 
            The National Association of School Psychologists was even worse. 
            "Discuss historical instances of American intolerance," is the kind 
            of psychological advice its Web site offers. "Identify &rsquo;heroes&rsquo; 
            [those scare-quotes, again!] of varying backgrounds involved in 
            response to the attacks."
            <P>And even worse still, the association's message to teachers on 
            how to talk to children about the attack assumes that they should 
            treat pupils' indignation or desire for military reprisal as 
            understandable but immature and inappropriate. "A natural reaction 
            to horrific acts of violence like the recent terrorist attacks on 
            the United States is the desire to lash out and punish the 
            perpetrators," the authors of the Web site message explained, 
            echoing the language of the conflict-resolution courses that have 
            indoctrinated the nation's schools with the idea that there is no 
            right and wrong, since each side has its own valuable point of view. 
            "People who are angry or frightened often feel that the ability to 
            &lsquo;fight back&rsquo; puts them more in control or will alleviate their sense 
            of pain." In the <I>New York Times</I>, Richard Rothstein 
            approvingly quoted a self-satisfied Providence, Rhode Island high 
            schooler well trained in conflict resolution but evidently ignorant 
            of Roosevelt, Pearl Harbor, or Dachau: "In class they keep on saying 
            that the bigger person is the one who walks away from the fight, the 
            one who wants peace. How many people do we have to kill to make 
            Americans feel better? Some of these politicians who want war are 
            acting younger than we are."
            <P>A FEMA Web site echoed this therapeutic approach to the question 
            of "what to tell the children." The important thing is to get kids 
            to express their fear and sadness. "Share your feelings," FEMA 
            advised teachers. "Talk with children about how they are feeling and 
            listen without judgment." </FONT>

            size=-1>aking it all to heart, Peter Jennings moderated a TV show 
            called "ABC News Answers Children's Questions" that aspired to play 
            the nation's first news-therapist. When a child spoke of not wanting 
            her soldier-father to leave for the Middle East, Jennings called 
            upon a mental-health worker, who bubbled: "It's her emotion and 
            feeling that will make her all right." Unfortunately for Jennings, 
            most of the other kids refused to follow the script. The truth is, 
            as many therapists who rushed to schools and churches after the 
            attack discovered, most kids can't yet understand the earthshaking 
            implications of the attack and are just not that frightened. "Do you 
            feel safe this week?" Jennings prodded a seven-year-old. "Yes," she 
            succinctly replied. Complained another child: "My mom and dad want 
            to talk about it all the time, and I don't." 
            <P>Jennings did get one young girl to tell him: "We've been planting 
            bombs in other people's homes. We're getting a taste of our own 
            medicine." The scrupulous Jennings nodded, "That's really very 
            interesting." It at last took a boy of about ten to point out that 
            Americans "do not intentionally kill thousands of innocent people." 
            Evidently Jennings did not find the ten-year-old's point "really 
            very interesting" and had nothing to say.</FONT>

            size=-1>he good news is that, on the evidence, vastly more Americans 
            these days have more in common with the ten-year-old than with the 
            ABC anchor. "I've been amazed not at what our elite are saying," 
            notes classicist and military historian Victor Davis Hanson, author 
            of <I>Carnage and Culture</I>, "but by how many ordinary people 
            aren't paying attention. . . . [The elites] live in a culture that's 
            just not connected to the rest of us."
            <P>In what was said to be his first interview after the attacks, 
            appearing in a fundamentalist Pakistani paper a week before his 
            horrific videotape, Usama bin Ladin was quoted as saying the United 
            States had been gripped by "psychological helplessness," that "fear 
            is the most lethal weapon," and that the U.S. media had "injected a 
            feeling of psychological helplessness . . . permanently into the 
            American people." And doubtless in surveying American culture our 
            pitiless foe finds much evidence to support such a malign view.
            <P>What he cannot see, in his cultural incomprehension, are the 
            numberless indications of our collective strength, character, and 
            resolve. Yale's Stephen Smith tells of the student who told him 
            she's thinking of joining the CIA</FONT><FONT

            size=-1>"the first time I ever heard anything like that at Yale," he 
            remarks. In Arlington, Virginia, according to the <I>Washington 
            Post</I>, a progressive school where students had earlier resisted a 
            new Virginia law requiring that schools set aside time for the 
            Pledge of Allegiance, spontaneously rose at an assembly the day they 
            returned to school after September 11 to recite the pledge they had 
            so recently scorned.
            <P>There's evidence that even many children of the sixties are at 
            long last starting to grow up morally. "The word 'evil' isn't funny 
            anymore," Scott Adams, creator of the popular cartoon "Dilbert," was 
            reported as saying. Observed <I>Slate</I> senior writer King 
            Kaufman, in an article that probably speaks for many of his boomer 
            contemporaries: "This is a new feeling for me, this feeling that 
            we're the good guys and we're fighting the bad guys."
            <P>Speaking to new faculty just days after the tragedy, Boston 
            University president Jon Westling struck a note that increasingly 
            resonates with Americans everywhere. "We are charged," he said, 
            "with the molding of adult and responsible character, and helping 
            ensure that this generation of students is worthily prepared to 
            inherit a civilization built on centuries of effort and sacrifice. 
            If it is to continue to be a civilization that faces adversity with 
            courage, that answers darkness with light, we have important work 
            before us."
            <P>Indeed, there's reason to hope that even the most benighted 
            American moral equivocators may come to realize that the message of 
            September is the exact opposite of the one they've been preaching. 
            It is <I>Western</I> culture that has given us tolerance, pluralism,
