                  href="http://www.firstthings.com/ssi-hf/ftcopyright.html">Copyright 
                  (c) 1995 <EM>First Things</EM> 58 (December 1995): 18-23.</A> 
                  <P></CENTER>Fat'hi ash-Shiqaqi, a well-educated young 
                  Palestinian living in Damascus, recently boasted of his 
                  familiarity with European literature. He told an interviewer 
                  how he had read and enjoyed Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, 
                  Sartre, and Eliot. He spoke of his particular passion for 
                  Sophocles' <EM>Oedipus Rex</EM>, a work he read ten times in 
                  English translation "and each time wept bitterly." Such 
                  acquaintance with world literature and such exquisite 
                  sensibility would not be of note except for two points-that 
                  Shiqaqi was, until his assassination in Malta a few weeks ago, 
                  an Islamist (or what is frequently called a "fundamentalist" 
                  Muslim) and that he headed Islamic Jihad, the arch- terrorist 
                  organization that has murdered dozens of Israelis over the 
                  last two years. 
                  <P>Shiqaqi's familiarity with things Western fits a common 
                  pattern. The brother of Eyad Ismail, one of the World Trade 
                  Center bombers recently extradited from Jordan, said of him, 
                  "He loved everything American from cowboy movies to 
                  hamburgers." His sister recalled his love of U.S. television 
                  and his saying, "I want to live in America forever." The 
                  family, she commented, "always considered him a son of 
                  America." His mother confirmed that "he loves the United 
                  States." Hasan at-Turabi, the effective ruler of Sudan, the 
                  man behind the notorious "ghost houses" and the brutal 
                  persecution of his country's large Christian minority, often 
                  flaunts his knowledge of the West, telling a French 
                  interviewer that most militant Islamic leaders, like himself, 
                  are "from the Christian, Western culture. We speak your 
                  languages." In a statement that sums up this whole outlook, an 
                  Islamist in Washington asserted, "I listen to Mozart; I read 
                  Shakespeare; I watch the Comedy Channel; and I also believe in 
                  the implementation of the Shari`a [Islamic sacred law]." 
                  <P>This pattern points to a paradox: the very intellectuals 
                  intent on marching the Muslim world back to the seventh 
                  century also excel in Western ways and seem very much to 
                  appreciate at least some of them. How does this happen? What 
                  does it indicate about their present strengths and future 
                  course? 
                  <P>Islamist leaders tend to be well acquainted with the West, 
                  having lived there, learned its languages, and studied its 
                  cultures. Turabi of the Sudan has advanced degrees from the 
                  University of London and the Sorbonne; he also spent a summer 
                  in the United States, touring the country on a U.S. 
                  taxpayer-financed program for foreign student leaders. Abbasi 
                  Madani, a leader of Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), 
                  received a doctorate in education from the University of 
                  London. His Tunisian counterpart, Rashid al-Ghannushi, spent a 
                  year in France and since 1993 makes his home in Great Britain. 
                  Necmettin Erbakan, Turkey's leading militant politician, 
                  studied in Germany. Mousa Mohamed Abu Marzook, the head of 
                  Hamas' political committee, has lived in the United States 
                  since 1980, has a doctorate in engineering from Louisiana 
                  State University, and has been classified as a permanent U.S. 
                  resident since 1990. Though for years he was able to elude law 
                  enforcement, Abu Marzook was recently arrested at a New York 
                  airport on his way into the country to register his son in an 
                  American school. 
                  <P>Indeed, the experience of living in the West often turns 
                  indifferent Muslims into Islamists. Discussing Mehdi Bazargan, 
                  an Iranian engineer who spent the years 1928-35 in France, 
                  Hamid Dabashi dissects the process many Muslim students 
                  undergo: 
                  <P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE>Beginning with the conscious or unconscious, 
                    articulated or mute, premise that they ought to remain 
                    firmly attached to their Islamic consciousness, they begin 
                    to admire "The Western" achievements. . . . They recognize a 
                    heightened state of ideological self-awareness on the part 
                    of "The West" that they identify as the source and cause of 
                    its achievements. They then look back at their own society 
                    where such technological achievements were lacking, a fact 
                    they attribute, in turn, to the absence of that heightened 
                    state of ideological self-awareness. </BLOCKQUOTE>The key 
                  notion here, the French analyst Olivier Roy explains, is the 
                  rather surprising idea that ideologies are "the key to the 
                  West's technical development." This assumption leads Islamists 
                  "to develop a modern political ideology based on Islam, which 
                  they see as the only way to come to terms with the modern 
                  world and the best means of confronting foreign imperialism." 
                  <P>Some of the leading figures fit this pattern. The Egyptian 
                  Sayyid Qutb went to the United States in 1948 as an admirer of 
                  things American, then "returned" to Islam during his two years 
                  resident there, becoming one of the most influential Islamist 
                  thinkers of our time. `Ali Shari`ati of Iran lived five years 
                  in Paris, 1960-65; from this experience came the key ideas of 
                  the Islamic Revolution. In other cases, Islamist thinkers do 
                  not actually live in the West but absorb its ways at a 
                  distance by learning a Western language and immersing 
                  themselves in Western ideas, as did the Indo-Pakistani 
                  journalist, thinker, and politician Sayyid Abul A'la Mawdudi 
                  (1903-79). In other cases, reading Western works in 
                  translation does the trick. Morteza Motahhari, a leading 
                  acolyte of the Ayatollah Khomeini, made as thorough a study of 
                  Marxism as possible in the Persian language. 
                  <P>Many of Islamism's intellectual lights also share a 
                  background of technical accomplishment. Erbakan quickly rose 
                  to the top of the engineering profession in Turkey as a full 
                  professor at Istanbul Technical University, director at a 
                  factory producing diesel motors, and even head of the 
                  country's Chamber of Commerce. Layth Shubaylat, a Jordanian 
                  firebrand, is also president of the Jordanian Engineers 
                  Association. These men take special pride in being able to 
                  challenge the West in the area of its greatest strength. 
                  <P>Actual terrorists also tend to be science-oriented, though 
                  less accomplished. Ramzi Yusuf, the accused mastermind of the 
                  World Trade Center bombing, is an electronics engineer and 
                  explosives expert with an advanced degree from Great Britain; 
                  Nidal Ayyad was an up-and-coming chemical engineer at Allied 
                  Signal; and Eyad Ismail studied computers and engineering at 
                  Wichita State University. This same pattern holds in the 
                  Middle East: Salah `Ali `Uthman, one of three terrorists who 
                  attacked a bus in Jerusalem in July 1993, was a student of 
                  computer science at the University in Gaza. The most notorious 
                  anti-Zionist terrorist of recent years is Yahya Ayyash, 
                  nicknamed "The Engineer." Many Islamist Egyptians who engage 
                  in violence against the regime have science degrees. The 
                  Islamist leaders are not peasants living in the unchanging 
                  countryside but modern, thoroughly urbanized individuals, many 
                  of them university graduates. Notwithstanding all their talk 
                  about recreating the society of the Prophet Muhammad, 
                  Islamists are modern individuals at the forefront of coping 
                  with modern life. 
                  <P>In contrast to this familiarity with Western ways, the 
                  Islamists are distant from their own culture. Turabi admitted 
                  to a French interviewer, "I know the history of France better 
                  than the history of Sudan; I love your culture, your painters, 
                  your musicians." Having found Islam on their own as adults, 
                  many Islamists are ignorant of their own history and 
                  traditions. Some of "the new generation," Martin Kramer notes, 
                  "are born-again Muslims, ill-acquainted with Islamic 
                  tradition." Tunisia's Minister of Religion Ali Chebbi goes 
                  further, saying that they "ignore the fundamental facts of 
                  Islam." Like Mawdudi, these autodidacts mix a bit of this and 
                  that, as Sayyed Vali Reza Nasr explains: 
                  <P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE>Mawdudi's formulation was by no means rooted in 
                    traditional Islam. He adopted modern ideas and values, 
                    mechanisms, procedures, and idioms, weaving them into an 
                    Islamic fabric. . . . He sought not to resurrect an 
                    atavistic order but to modernize the traditional conception 
                    of Islamic thought and life. His vision represented a clear 
                    break with Islamic tradition and a fundamentally new reading 
                    of Islam which took its cue from modern thought. 
                  </BLOCKQUOTE>On reflection, this lack of knowledge should not 
                  be surprising. Islamists are individuals educated in modern 
                  ways who seek solutions to modern problems. The Prophet may 
                  inspire them, but they approach him through the filter of the 
                  late twentieth century. In the process, they unintentionally 
                  substitute Western ways for those of traditional Islam. 
                  <P>Traditional Islam-the immensely rewarding faith of nearly a 
                  billion adherents-developed a civilization that for over a 
                  millennium provided order to the lives of young and old, rich 
                  and poor, sophisticate and ignorant, Moroccan and Malaysian. 
                  Alienated from this tradition, Islamists seem willing to 
                  abandon it in a chimerical effort to return to the pure and 
                  simple ways of Muhammad. To connect spiritually to the first 
                  years of Islam, when the Prophet was alive and the faith was 
                  new, they seek to skip back thirteen centuries. The most 
                  mundane issues inspire them to recall the Prophet's times. 
                  Thus, an author portrays the "survival tactics" employed by 
                  Muslim students at American universities to retain their 
                  Islamic identity as "much like the early Muslims during the 
                  Hijra [Muhammad's exile from Mecca to Medina]." 
                  <P>Islamists see themselves, however, not as tradition-bound 
                  but as engaged in a highly novel enterprise. According to 
                  Iran's spiritual leader, `Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, "The Islamic 
                  system that the imam [Khomeni] created . . . has not existed 
                  in the course of history, except at the beginning [of Islam]." 
                  Ghannushi similarly asserts that "Islam is ancient but the 
                  Islamist movement is recent." In rejecting a whole millennium, 
                  the Islamists throw out a great deal of their own societies, 
                  from the great corpus of Qur'anic scholarship to the finely 
                  worked interpretations of law. 
                  <P>On the contrary, they admire efficient factories and 
                  armies. The Muslim world seems backward to them and they 
                  urgently seek its overhaul through the application of modern 
                  means. When this process goes slowly, they blame the West for 
                  withholding its technology. Thus, `Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the 
                  Iranian arch-radical, plaintively bemoans that "the United 
                  States and the West will never give us the technology" to 
                  pursue what he quaintly calls "the science of 
                  industrialization." 
                  <P>The Islamists' goal turns out to be not a genuinely Islamic 
                  order but an Islamic-flavored version of Western reality. This 
                  is particularly apparent in four areas: religion, daily life, 
                  politics, and the law. It's certainly not their intent, but 
                  militant Muslims have introduced some distinctly Christian 
                  notions into their Islam. Traditional Islam was characterized 
                  by informal organizations. Virtually every major 
                  decision-establishing a canonical text of the Qur'an, 
                  excluding philosophical inquiry, or choosing which religious 
                  scholars to heed-was reached in an unstructured and consensual 
                  way. This has been the genius of the religion, and it meant 
                  that rulers who tried to control the religious institution 
                  usually failed. 
                  <P>Islamists, ignorant of this legacy, have set up church-like 
                  structures. The trend began in Saudi Arabia, where the 
                  authorities built a raft of new institutions. Already in 1979, 
                  Khalid Duren wrote about the emergence of a "priestly 
                  hierarchy with all its churchly paraphernalia": 
                  <P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE>A number of religious functionaries have come 
                    into being whose posts were previously unheard of, for 
                    example: the Secretary of the Muslim World League, the 
                    Secretary General of the Islamic Conference, the Rector of 
                    the Islamic University in Medina, and so [on] and so forth. 
                    For the first time in history the imam of the Ka'ba has been 
                    sent on tour of foreign countries as if he were an Apostolic 
                    nuncio. </BLOCKQUOTE>The Islamic Republic of Iran soon 
                  followed the Saudi model and went beyond it, Shahrough Akhavi 
                  explains, to institute a Catholic-style control of the clergy: 

                  <P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE>The centralization that has occurred in the 
                    religious institution in Iran is unprecedented, and actions 
                    have been taken that resemble patterns in the ecclesiastical 
                    church tradition familiar in the West. For example, in 1982, 
                    Khomeini encouraged the "defrocking" and "excommunication" 
                    of his chief rival, Ayatollah Muhammad Kazim Shari`atmadari 
                    (d. 1986), although no machinery for this has ever existed 
                    in Islam. Other trends, such as centralized control over 
                    budgets, appointments to the professoriate, curricula in the 
                    seminaries, the creation of religious militias, monopolizing 
                    the representation of interests, and mounting a Kulturkampf 
                    in the realm of the arts, the family, and other social 
                    issues tell of the growing tendency to create an "Islamic 
                    episcopacy" in Iran. </BLOCKQUOTE>Even more striking, Akhavi 
                  notes, is how Khomeini made himself pope: 
                  <P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE>Khomeini's practice of issuing authoritative 
                    fatwas, obedience to which is made compulsory, comes close 
                    to endowing the top jurist with powers not dissimilar to 
                    those of the pope in the Catholic Church. After all, 
                    compliance with a particular cleric's <EM>fatwas</EM> in the 
                    past had not been mandatory. </BLOCKQUOTE>In creating this 
                  faux Christian hierarchy, Islamists invented something more 
                  Western than Islamic. In similar fashion, Islamists have 
                  turned Friday into a Sabbath, something it had not previously 
                  been. Traditionally, Friday was a day of congregating for 
                  prayer, not a day of rest. Indeed, the whole idea of the 
                  Sabbath is alien to the vehemently monotheistic spirit of 
                  Islam, which deems the notion of God needing a day of rest 
                  falsely anthropomorphic. Instead, the Qur'an instructs Muslims 
                  to "leave off business" only while praying; once finished, 
                  they should "disperse through the land and seek God's 
                  bounty"-in other words, engage in commerce. A day of rest so 
                  smacks of Jewish and Christian practice that some traditional 
                  Islamic authorities actually discouraged taking Friday off. In 
                  most places and times, Muslims did work on Fridays, 
                  interrupted only by the communal service. 
                  <P>In modern times, Muslim states imitated Europe and adopted 
                  a day of rest. The Ottoman Empire began closing government 
                  offices on Thursdays, a religiously neutral day, in 1829. 
                  Christian imperialists imposed Sunday as the weekly day of 
                  rest throughout their colonies, a practice many Muslim rulers 
                  adopted as well. Upon independence, virtually every Muslim 
                  government inherited the Sunday rest and maintained it. S. D. 
                  Goitein, the foremost scholar of this subject, notes that 
                  Muslim states did so "in response to the exigencies of modern 
                  life and in imitation of Western precedent." 
                  <P>Recently, as the Sunday Sabbath came to be seen as too 
                  Western, Muslim rulers asserted their Islamic identities by 
                  instituting Friday as the day off. Little did they realize 
                  that, in so doing, they perpetuated a specifically 
                  Judeo-Christian custom. And as Fridays have turned into a 
                  holiday (for family excursions, spectator sports, etc.), 
                  Muslims have imitated the Western weekend. 
                  <P>Perhaps the most striking Westernisms Islamists have 
                  introduced are associated with women. Islamists actually 
                  espouse an outlook more akin to Western-style feminism than 
                  anything in traditional Islam. Traditional Muslim men 
                  certainly did not take pride in the freedom and independence 
                  of their women, but 
                  <P>Islamists do. Ahmad al-Banna, the leader of Egypt's Muslim 
                  Brethren, adopts a feminist outlook that leads him to 
                  reinterpret Muslim history according to Western standards. 
                  "Muslim women have been free and independent for fifteen 
                  centuries. Why should we follow the example of Western women, 
                  so dependent on their husbands in material matters?" 
                  <P>Traditional Muslim men took pride in their women staying 
                  home; in well- to-do households, they almost neve
