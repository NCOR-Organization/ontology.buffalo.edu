<P>Everyone concerned to promote emancipation and enlightenment has been 
exhilarated by the historic changes of these last five years: first among the 
self-styled peoples' democracies; and then within the former USSR itself. 
Spectacular developments within what was until only yesterday the Socialist Bloc 
came at the end of two decades during which, first in Greece, then the Iberian 
peninsula and later generally throughout Latin America, military dictatorships 
and other authoritarian, but not totalitarian regimes were replaced by elected 
governments. All this, along with some signs of similar developments even in 
Africa, led Francis Fukuyama to ask in a much talked of article (published in 
<CITE>The National Interest</CITE> in Summer 1989) whether we are witness to 
`The End of History?' 
<P>By this, of course, was not meant either an end of all historical events - 
such as the subsequent Gulf War - or that there will never again be an 
authoritarian or totalitarian regime anywhere. It was, rather, that such regimes 
as do survive or emerge will never again be seen as elements in an irresistible 
wave of the future. And that, from now on, rulers who have not been elected, and 
- what should be seen as much more important - rulers who cannot in due course 
be removed through an equally free election, will everywhere be accounted 
aberrant and radically illegitimate. 
<H2>I</H2>
<P>There is, however, another totalitarian ideology which needs to be considered 
here. For many of its ever more numerous adherents see themselves as militants 
of a movement of which the eventual worldwide triumph is guaranteed not just by 
an impersonal hypostatized History but by an omnipotent intending Agent. When in 
1920 Bertrand Russell visited the USSR - decades before the Politburo found it 
convenient to present itself as the Protector of the Arabs - he discerned 
similarities between Bolshevism and Islam: "Bolshevism combines the 
characteristics of the French Revolution with those of the rise of Islam";(1) 
and "Marx has taught that Communism is fatally predestined to come about; this 
produces a state of mind not unlike that of the early successors of 
Mahommet."(2) So Russell himself concluded: 
<P>Mahommedanism and Bolshevism are practical, social, unspiritual, concerned to 
win the empire of this world ... What Mahommedanism did for the Arabs, 
Bolshevism may do for the Russians.(3) 
<P>As a clear, commendably honest and altogether authoritative epitome of the 
totalitarian character of Islam consider this manifesto issued in Leicester, 
England, on behalf of the Islamic Council of Europe:(4) 
<P>The religion of Islam embodies the final and most complete word of God ... 
Departmentalization of life into different watertight compartments, religious 
and secular, sacred and profane, spiritual and material is ruled out ... Islam 
is not a religion in the Western understanding of the word. It is a faith and a 
way of life, a religion and a social order, a doctrine and a code of conduct, a 
set of values and principles, and a social movement to realize them in 
history.(5) 
<P>In this we have an statement which satisfactorily transcends all differences 
within and between various Muslim communities, such as those between Sunni and 
Shi'a or between the so-called Fundamentalists and their opponents. The term 
`fundamentalist' is anyway in the present case peculiarly inappropriate. It is 
derived from the title of a series of tracts - The Fundamentals - published in 
the USA in 1909; and it is defined as the belief that The Bible, as the Word of 
God, is wholly, literally and infallibly true - a belief which, notoriously, 
commits fundamentalist Christians to defending the historicity of the accounts 
of Creation given in the first two Chapters of Genesis. To rate as truly a 
Christian it is by no means necessary to be in this understanding 
fundamentalist. It is instead fully sufficient wholeheartedly to accept the 
Apostles' and/or the Nicene Creed. But in order to be properly accounted a 
Muslim it is essential to be a fundamentalist with regard to (not The Bible but) 
<CITE>The Koran</CITE>. 
<P>The crux is that, whereas only a very small proportion of all the 
propositions contained in the Christian Bible are presented as statements made 
directly by God in any of the three persons of the Trinity, <CITE>The 
Koran</CITE> consists entirely and exclusively of what are believed to be Divine 
revelations made through the Prophet Muhammad, and made therefore in Arabic.(6) 
These revelations are supposed to have been 
<P>... received, in circumstances of a trance-like nature, over a considerable 
number of years intermittently, the first ... dating from about A.D. 610 and the 
last shortly before Muhammad's death in A.D. 632 ... Tradition relates that a 
few years after his death the scattered fragments were collected together ... 
<P>But it was only 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>... during the reign of the third Caliph Uthman (644-56) that the 
  definitive canon was established by a panel of editors directed by the 
  Prophet's amanuensis Zaid ibn Thabit.(7)</DD></DL>
<P>As might be expected, given this method of compilation, the resulting book is 
extremely repetitious. Although, except for the first and one of the shortest, 
the 114 surahs or chapters are arranged only in descending order of length it 
would be difficult if not impossible to suggest a better alternative. Unlike the 
Christian Bible, which contains several sorts of writings - historical essays, 
collections of psalms and of proverbs, four separate accounts of the preachings 
and eventual martyrdom of Jesus, letters to branches of his young and growing 
church, and so on - <CITE>The Koran</CITE> is a collection of recorded teachings 
coming from or through a single mouth. One consequence is that the theologians 
of Islam have little room for manoeuvre; either for softening harshnesses which 
prove embarrassing; or for developing doctrines found or supposedly implicit in 
some books but not in others. So the history of Islam provides no parallels to 
the disputes about, for instance, the nature of the Trinity(8) which have riven 
Christendom. 
<P>The Prophet Muhammad appears as the final Messenger from the Mosaic God of 
Judaism and Christianity. A total of 28 predecessors are named in <CITE>The 
Koran</CITE> as having previously been assigned to spread the message of 
obedience to Him. One of these, mentioned frequently and always respectfully, is 
"Jesus Son of Mary". But the crucial Christian claim that Jesus was the Son of 
God is categorically repudiated, and those who persist in maintaining that claim 
are condemned to "a painful chastisement": 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>They are unbelievers <BR>who say, God is the Third of Three <BR>No god is 
  there but One God <BR>If they refrain not from what they are say, there 
  <BR>shall afflict those of them that disbelieve <BR>a painful chastisement ... 
  <BR>... and in the chastisement they <BR>shall dwell forever.(9)</DD></DL>
<P>That "painful chastisement" will thus clearly be for the offence of heretical 
belief, and, as <CITE>The Koran</CITE> asserts repeatedly, it will not only 
consist in the infliction of extremes of agony but also - infinitely more severe 
- continue eternally. Every surah begins "In the Name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate", while the first proceeds forthwith, as sooner or later do most 
of the rest, inconsistently to indicate that there is to be a Day of Doom on 
which the mercy and the compassion of "The All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate" 
will be revealed to be strictly and very narrowly restricted: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being <BR>the All-merciful, the 
  All-compassionate, <BR>the Master of the Day of Doom. <BR>Thee only we serve; 
  of Thee alone we pray for succour. <BR>Guide us in the straight path, <BR>the 
  path of those whom Thou hast blessed, <BR>not of those against whom Thou art 
  wrathful <BR>nor of those who are astray.</DD></DL>
<P>The central, fundamental, continually and emphatically repeated message of 
<CITE>The Koran</CITE> combines a promise with a threat. The promise is to 
"Those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness - theirs shall be forgiveness 
and generous provision";(10) a generous provision including among other 
attractions not only "Gardens of Delight" but also "wide-eyed houris as the 
likeness of hidden pearls".(11) The threat is to unbelievers "those who strive 
against Our signs to avoid them - they shall be inhabitants of Hell";(12) a 
habitation in which "garments of fire shall be cut for the unbelievers" and 
where "for them await hooked iron rods as often as they desire in their anguish 
to come forth from the eternal fire".(13) 
<P>Since no attempt is ever made to reconcile these threats of eternal torture 
for too belatedly repentant unbelievers with the endlessly reiterated assertion 
that Allah is "the All-Merciful, the All-compassionate" it becomes appropriate 
to recall a very characteristic observation made by Thomas Hobbes, in his 
Leviathan, that 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>... in the attributes which we give to God we are not to consider the 
  signification of philosophical truth, but the signification of pious 
  intention, to do him the greatest honour we are able.(14)</DD></DL>
<P><CITE>The Koran</CITE> calls for belief and consequent obedience. It is, 
surely, calculated to inspire fear, indeed abject terror, rather than love. So 
it is altogether appropriate that the apologetic argument since attributed to 
and named for Pascal was employed centuries earlier by the famous Sufi 
theologian al-Ghazzali, who died in A.D. 1111.(15) Allah is presented in 
<CITE>The Koran</CITE>, notwithstanding "the attributes perceived disobedience 
and crushes perceived opposition by eternally extended exercises of 
uninhibitedly and total power.(16) 
<P>The qualification `perceived' has to go in since actually to oppose or to 
disobey we should need to believe in the existence and orders of the despot, 
while any who actually knew that opposition or disobedience was to berewarded by 
eternal torture and yet chose to disobey or to oppose would, by simply engaging 
in such egregiously and inordinately insane behaviour, show themselves not to be 
fit and proper subjects of punishment. 
<P>The sentences which Allah is to hand down on the Day of Doom are alleged to 
be just, despite the inordinate disparity between finite offences and infinite 
penalties, because "every soul earns only its own account; no soul laden bears 
the load of another".(17) By the hypothesis that is no doubt correct, but only 
so long as "the load of another" is construed as the load of another human 
being. Yet <CITE>The Koran</CITE> contains an abundance of passages, paralleling 
those notorious hard sayings of St. Paul which insist that God, conceived not 
only as the omnipotent initiating and sustaining cause of the entire Universe 
and of everything in it, but also as punishing some of its creatures, must 
therefore be recognized to be punishing those creatures for offences for which, 
by the hypothesis, God alone cannot escape the ultimate sole responsibility. All 
such Divine discriminations have therefore to be seen as arbitrary exercises of 
total power: 
<P>Therefore hath he mercy upon whom he will have mercy and whom he will be 
hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, `Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath 
resisted his will?' Nay but, O man, who are thou that replies against God? Shall 
the thing formed say to him that formed it, `Why has thou made me thus?' Hath 
not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto 
honour, and another unto dishonour?(18) 
<P>The first parallel passage in <CITE>The Koran</CITE> comes at the very 
beginning: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>As for the unbelievers, alike it is to them, <BR>whether thou has warned 
  them or hast not warned them, <BR>they do not believe. <BR>God has set a seal 
  on their hearts and on their hearing, <BR>and on the eyes is a covering, 
  <BR>and there awaits them a mighty chastisement.(19) </DD></DL>
<P>Christian apologists never cease from arguing that by endowing humankind with 
the dangerous attribute of freewill God breaks the chain of causation and thus 
escapes responsibility for our actions. A similar attempt was made in the early 
days of Islam.(20) But the overwhelmingly dominant position is that argued in `A 
Popular Theological Statement'.(21) Reasonably enough, since the fact that we 
are indeed creatures who can and cannot but make choices, some of which are made 
of our own free will and others only under various degrees of compulsion or 
constraint, does not preclude the possibility, and on these assumptions the 
necessity of Divine causation making us the particular creatures who actually 
make whatever choices we do in fact freely make in whatever senses we do indeed 
freely choose to make those choices.(22) Thus this Statement insists that "it is 
the duty of every Muslim to believe" that "Both good things and evil things are 
the result of God's decree". Nevertheless it continues, 
<P>Modern theologians sometimes teach that God has the duty to be good, to do 
good for people, to will the good ... God has no such duty. If He had ... His 
free will and power would be limited, which is clearly contrary to the dogma of 
omnipotence and the divine will.(23) 
<P>The same Statement grasps the key to understanding what it is to have a 
choice; and why it is impossible for those who have acquired the concept of 
choice to deny that they are members of a kind of creatures which can, and 
cannot but, actually make choices: "Any person discovers a difference in moving 
a hand and when the air moves it."(24) The distinction between these two 
fundamentally different kinds of bodily movements is, of course, that the former 
- label these movings - are, while the latter - label those motions - are not, 
under the direct control of the person, the agent, whose movements they are. But 
although our movings are thus always and necessarily under our direct control, 
and although alternative movings or an abstention from moving must therefore 
always be possible, none of this provides any guarantee that it is not the 
agency of God which makes us all the different people who choose in the various 
senses in which we do severally choose. However, if it were, then it would not 
do to respond by maintaining that, for that reason, we really and truly could 
not have done other than we actually did. For the crucial expression "could do 
otherwise" is, surely, definable itself only ostensively and by reference to 
movings? 
<H2>II</H2>
<P>It should by now be obvious that Islam is one of those "Great and terrible 
systems of divinity ... which, if true, might drive a wise man mad." So are 
there evidencing reasons for concluding that it is certainly or even very 
probably true? If we were forced to conclude that it is more probable than any 
non-hell-threatening alternative, then that conclusion would surely constitute a 
powerful motivating reason to persuade ourselves of its certain truth.(25) 
<P>The question whether Muhammad was a Messenger from the Mosaic God must be 
distinguished from the logically prior question whether there is such a sender 
of Messengers. The affirmative answer to that logically prior question <CITE>The 
Koran</CITE> takes absolutely for granted, presupposing in the reader or hearer 
knowledge of or derived from both The Bible and "some sort of native Arabian 
tradition".(26) Of the twenty eight predecessors mentioned most attention is 
given to Moses and after him to Jesus and, curiously, Noah. Moses too is the one 
who is alleged to have been supplied with the most spectacular credentials in 
the shape of the Plagues of Egypt. 
<P>To those familiar with traditional Christian apologetic it is remarkable that 
no claims are made about miracles allegedly worked by or on behalf of Muhammad 
himself - at any rate if we except the contention that the composition of 
<CITE>The Koran</CITE>, which is apparently agreed by all those competent to 
judge to be the supreme masterpiece of Arabic literature, itself constitutes a 
miracle.(27) This omission gave purchase to the objection which Aquinas took to 
be decisive. Muhammad, Aquinas wrote: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>... did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, by which 
  alone divine inspiration is appropriately evidenced; since a visible action 
  which can only be divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. ... 
  It is thus clear that those who place any faith in his words believe 
  frivolously.(28)</DD></DL>
<P>The only contemporary supposed signs to which <CITE>The Koran</CITE> appeals 
as evidences are various familiar facts of nature described as the achievements 
of Allah. For instance: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DD>Those are the signs of the Book; <BR>and that which has been sent down to 
  thee <BR>from thy Lord is the truth, but most men <BR>do not believe. <BR>God 
  is He who raised up the heavens <BR>without pillars you can see, <BR>then He 
  sat Himself upon the Throne, <BR>He subjected the sun and the moon, <BR>each 
  one running to a term stated, <BR>He directs the affair ... <BR>It is He who 
  stretched out the earth <BR>and set therein <BR>firm mountains and rivers, 
  <BR>and of every fruit he placed there two kinds, <BR>covering the day with 
  the night. <BR>Surely in that there are signs for people who reflect.(29) 
</DD></DL>
<P>And, after some more of the very similar, "surely in that are signs for 
people who understand". But a reflection which thus proceeds immediately from 
visible facts to their Invisible Cause, and an understanding which is manifested 
in this inference, must be prejudiced. The prejudicially drawn conclusion may be 
correct. For prejudices are not necessarily and as such mistaken. But, absent 
the prejudicial assumption, such arguments are manifestly unsound. For they 
proceed directly, as Aristotle might have put it, from actuality to 
impossibility: from descriptions of what to all appearance occurs normally and 
naturally; to the conclusion that these phenomena cannot really be what they 
appear to be but are instead the products of supernatural agency. 
<P>Some lines from Uncle Tom's Cabin are more revealing here than perhaps the 
authoress recognized. For, unlike the Yankee Miss Ophelia, poor Topsy had never 
been theologically indoctrinated by either parent or preacher. Yet she had had 
abundant opportunity to learn from rural observation what in my young day urban 
fathers used to reveal to schoolbound sons as "the facts of life". So it is 
Topsy who answers for unprejudiced common sense and common experience: 
<P>"Do you know who made you?" "Nobody, as I knows on," said the child with a 
short laugh. The idea appeared to amuse her considerably; for her eyes twinkled 
and she added: "I s'pect I grow'd. Dont thin' nobody ever made me."(30)

1979, pp. 428-454.<BR>4. I chose a statement from this organization, rather than 
anything from a traditionally Muslim country, in order to draw attention to the 
fact that there has since World War II been a massive and still continuing 
Muslim immigration into the UK, France, Germany and other countries of Western 
Europe. Both by natural increase and through further immigration all these 
minorities are growing both absolutely and relative to the non-Muslim 
majorities. Compare, for instance, Mervyn Hiskett, <I>Some To Mecca Turn to 
Pray</I>, Claridge, London, 1993; also the publications of Majority Rights, B.M.

Introduction to his translation, first published by Allen and Unwin in London in 
1955. Subsequent references will be to the OUP World's Classic paperback edition

absolute, unequivocal monotheism, is utterly repugnant to Islam.<BR>9. V, pp. 
112 and 113.<BR>10. XXII, p. 339. Nowhere can I find any suggestion that 
unbelievers who "do deeds of righteousness" might be excused resurrection and 
hence damnation.<BR>11. LVI, p. 560.<BR>12. XXII, p. 339<BR>13. XXII, p.

Uninhibited, that is to say, by any enlightenment objections to torture or other 
cruel and unusual punishment. The notorious this-worldly punishment of manual 
amputation is specifically prescribed by <I>The Koran</I>: "And the thief, male 
and female; cut off the hands of both, as ... a punishment exemplary from God" 
(V, p. 106). To reject it as the outrage which it is must therefore be to become 
less of a Muslim, albeit a somewhat more enlightened human being.<BR>17. VI, p.

by one of the editors that "it is found in many Islamic countries ... it has 
been accepted as dogma for a long time among Shafeitic and Hanafitic scholars. 
Divine predestination and (the absence of) human responsibility are discussed 
almost verbatim in many other tracts and treatises in Islamic lands. Islamic 
theology is homogeneous."<BR>22. For further discussion see Antony Flew and 
Godfrey Vesey <I>Agency and Necessity</I>, Blackwell, Oxford, 1987. This work 
quotes Luther's comment upon this necessity: "Now by `necessity' I do not mean 
`compulsorily' ... a man without the Spirit of God does not do evil against his 
will, under pressure, as though he were taken by the scruff of his neck and 
dragged into it, like a thief or a footpad being dragged off against his will to 
punishment; but he does it spontaneously and voluntarily." It also cites his 
desperate response to the challenge quoted earlier from Romans: "The highest 
degree of faith is to believe that He is just, though of his own free will he 
makes us ... proper subjects for damnation and seems (in the words of Erasmus) 
`to delight in the torments of poor wretches and to be a fitter object for hate 
than love'. If I could by any means understand how this same God ... can yet be 
merciful and just, there would be no need for faith." (pp. 88-89)<BR>23. Rippin 
and Knappert, 1986, p. 133. Islam therefore spares itself the Problem of Evil: 
the insoluble problem, that is to say, of reconciling the actual existence of 
evil and the putative existence of a God who is not only all-powerful but also 
all-good.<BR>24. Ibid, p. 134.<BR>25. For development of such an argument, 
distinguishing evidencing from motivating reasons for belief, see the article 
referenced in Note 15, above.<BR>26. Andrew Rippin, <I>Muslims: Their Religious 
Beliefs and Practices</I>, Routledge, London and New York, 1990, vol. 1, p.
