      <H2>What did Aum Shinrikyo have in mind?</H2>
      <H4>Ian Hacking</H4>
      <P class=revbookdetail><I>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the 
      Japanese Psyche </I>by Haruki Murakami, translated by Alfred Birnbaum and 
      Philip Gabriel.<BR>Harvill, 309 pp., £20, 1 June, 1 86046 757 1</P>
      <P class=BTFO>Every once in a while, something happens to you that makes 
      you realise that the human race is not quite as bad as it so often seems 
      to be. In 1972, I was on the London Underground when a man failed to mind 
      the gap. Not only did he put his foot between the train and the platform, 
      but he did so as the train was starting; he was dragged a short distance 
      before the train was halted, and his leg was pulled downwards. He was in 
      agony, his leg was torn and he could not extricate it from the gap. 
      Someone, a station guard or a commuter, took charge. 'Lean against the 
      carriage and lift it!' he shouted. We did. 'One, two, three - heave.' We 
      heaved and held. It is quite surprising how high you can lift an 
      Underground carriage if the lot of you give it body and soul for a short 
      time. The man was helped out, the emergency services arrived, and we all 
      went our different ways.</P>
      <P class=BT>This story is not peculiar to the calm, stoic, civil Londoners 
      of Blitz legend. It could have taken place in Budapest, San Francisco or 
      Kyoto. The important thing is that everyone involved knew exactly what had 
      happened. A terrorist bomb in Selfridges would make most of us lose our 
      cool, but we would also know roughly what to do. We might be in shock. We 
      might not afterwards be proud of our behaviour - we thought we were more 
      courageous than we are - but at least we would know what had happened.</P>
      <P class=BT>Now suppose that we had all started coughing, that a station 
      guard had picked up a plastic carrier bag, dumped it in a trash container, 
      and fallen down foaming at the mouth, just as you noticed that your vision 
      was failing. Would you have had any idea what to do? Would any collective 
      action have made sense? I was certainly sceptical about lifting the 
      Underground carriage, but the cry of the anonymous leader made sense to 
      everyone in the crowd. What would make sense if your Tube stop was the 
      subject of a sarin gas attack? Haruki Murakami thinks the events in the 
      Tokyo Underground of 20 March 1995 can teach us something about the 
      Japanese psyche. I am not convinced: any more than I would be if someone 
      told me that the rescue of the man who failed to mind the gap said 
      something about the British or the London psyche.</P>
      <P class=BT><I>Underground</I> is a personal quest that prompts more 
      questions than it can answer. Who is Murakami? Is there such a thing as a 
      Japanese psyche, or a French psyche? What was the gas attack on Tokyo: 
      which gas was used, what are its effects? Did the Japanese infrastructure 
      deal competently with the attack, or did it break down? Who were the 
      people who launched the attack? Why did they do it? How did it affect the 
      people who inhaled the gas? How have security systems all over the world 
      adapted to the possibility of such an attack? Is it relevant that this was 
      a nerve gas attack on the Japanese Underground, itself the nerve system of 
      the city? What would you, or I, have done had we been there on the busy 
      morning of 20 March 1995? How would it have tested our character?</P>
      <P class=BT>Murakami has a primary objective. Break down the 'them' and 
      'us', the attitude that holds that we are sane and they (those who 
      launched the attack) are nuts. His book consists of interviews with people 
      who were on the subway that morning, followed by a few interviews with 
      members of Aum Shinrikyo, the secret society that set off the gas attack. 
      (In Japan these two parts were published as separate books.) There are 
      slender conjectures about 'them' and 'us' being part of the same social 
      structure, and sharing the same national psyche. I shall try to address 
      some of the questions, and I shall fail miserably. That, perhaps, is one 
      point of Murakami's book. We all fail miserably. But we do not have to 
      leave it there. There are many facts, to start with. But they have a lot 
      of different dimensions. The substance. The cult. The victims. The 
      author.</P>
      <P class=BT>Let's start with the substance, the nerve gas called sarin. A 
      subclass of chemicals called organophosphorous plays havoc with the 
      signals that pass through the nervous system of pretty much anything that 
      has a nervous system, from people to mites. Sarin was one of the first of 
      these substances to be synthesised and investigated. It is quite a simple 
      chemical, and can be made from cheap materials. It was developed in 
      Germany in 1938. A similar organophosphorous was manufactured there in 
      significant quantities during the war but never used. The German military 
      prudently judged that once the Americans had worked out the formula, they 
      could use the overwhelming superiority of Allied air power to kill every 
      last German - man, woman, child, cow, sheep, dog, cat, flea and mite. Soon 
      after the war, chemists in Britain managed to produce stuff ten times 
      crueller than sarin, and these more lethal substances became the core of 
      the US and British nerve gas arsenal. (The UK seems long to have been a 
      leader in the field.)</P>
      <P class=BT>Perhaps the German high command should not have worried so 
      much. Sarin, cheap to make, is not so easy to 'deliver' - the euphemism 
      for 'to kill people with'. The standard procedure for rich governments is 
      to finish producing a nerve gas only on delivery: that is, you have two 
      non-lethal components that you lob at your enemy, and when they land, a 
      small explosion enables them to interact and produce the deadly stuff. It 
      is widely believed that Iraq used nerve gas when it fought Iran in one of 
      the most horrible wars of the 20th century. The American war against Iraq 
      paid full attention to the possibility of gases, and no one knows for sure 
      whether some nerve gases, perhaps released from bombed factories, caused 
      Gulf War Syndrome - or was it the depleted uranium used to coat American 
      shells, which makes them better at piercing armour, but which gets into 
      the atmosphere after the shells explode?</P>
      <P class=BT>The Tokyo gas attackers settled on a simple delivery system. 
      The gas is volatile. They packaged their product in a plastic bag, wrapped 
      it in newspaper, put it at the exit to a subway carriage, and when the 
      carriage came to a stop, stabbed the bag with the inevitable umbrella, and 
      ran out to a waiting car or taxi. Three Underground lines were almost 
      simultaneously attacked in this way; Murakami distinguishes seven 
      different sites on these lines. It's believed that a total of ten men made 
      the primary deliveries.</P>
      <P class=BT>Sarin is deadly, but its real-life potency is often overstated 
      (as in the first translator's footnote to this book): it is pure sarin 
      that is so lethal and it is not very easy to make it pure. The Tokyo gas 
      attack relied on a fairly impure product. Sarin is almost odourless, but 
      this stuff seems to have smelled like paint thinner. The number of people 
      killed was quite small, a total of 12. Many, many more passengers suffered 
      from complex after-effects. An early official summary stated that 3796 
      people were affected. The more commonly cited number today is about five 
      thousand. A recent study found that around 30 per cent of these people are 
      still affected, many of them by post-traumatic stress disorder.</P>
      <P class=BT>If you were just intent on killing people you could do better 
      with a bomb made of agricultural fertiliser. You could also kill vastly 
      more people using the same impure sarin and a slightly different delivery 
      system. The same plastic bags, deployed differently, and not in the 
      Underground, could have efficiently killed thousands of Japanese. (Forgive 
      me for omitting the details; unfortunately anyone with minimum technical 
      dexterity can figure this out.) One hypothesis would be that the attackers 
      wanted not so much to kill people as to attack the Tokyo Underground 
      system as a symbol of Japan at its technological, organised best. The 
      Underground station most heavily attacked was Kasumigaseki, which is 
      directly under the highest concentration of government offices - read 
      Whitehall - so the targets could be thought of as the top junior people in 
      the Japanese civil service on their way to work.</P>
      <P class=BT>Who is Murakami? An exceptionally successful Japanese novelist 
      whose work figures prominently on the fiction shelves of every Western 
      bookshop I've looked in. I loved the first book of his that I read, 
      <I>Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World</I> (1993), but there is 
      a basic plot-line in almost all his novels that is a bit jading. There is 
      always a Narrator, a loner, who knows several very odd people, one of whom 
      is usually a terminally virginal nymphet, on whom the Narrator has no 
      designs. His relationship to reality, or to alternative realities, is less 
      than secure. There are regular dollops of soft porn involving consenting 
      adults. His refrigerator has a truly amazing capacity for beer and his 
      lady friends of all ages have very audible cigarette lighters. There are 
      some menus, gracefully thrown together, but the Narrator seems to eat more 
      spaghetti than anything else. He slurps it up, in fact, which fits well 
      with the oral passions elsewhere on show. Anybody in Tokyo who is rich 
      enough has an unbelievably expensive European car. For the Narrator, it is 
      second-hand Subarus all the way.</P>
      <P class=BT>The odder the people whom the Narrator knows, the more likely 
      they are to disappear, or cross over into another world. Murakami's most 
      elegant, and truly pure, short story seems, in retrospect, to tell it all: 
      'The Elephant Vanishes'. Everyone in town is looking for a missing 
      elephant; only the Narrator knows that there is a very simple explanation 
      for the inability of the police and the boy scouts to find the elephant: 
      it vanished.</P>
      <P class=BT>The Narrator listens, very knowledgably, to a lot of Western 
      music, jazz, popular and classical. <I>Norwegian Wood</I>, recently 
      released in English, although already translated into many other 
      languages, was Murakami's first great success in Japan.* It is named after 
      the Beatles song and is not unlike <I>The Catcher in the Rye</I> or 
      <I>L'Education sentimentale</I>, or something between the two with a bit 
      of <I>Werther</I> thrown in. High praise, but not higher than it received 
      at home, where it was a stunning bestseller. We are informed by the 
      publishers that a previous English translation was made commercially for 
      Japanese learning English: since they knew the (by no means short) story 
      off by heart, this was a good text to learn from. I found it an 
      interesting place to learn about Japan in 1968, when the story is set. The 
      Narrator makes it through 1968, slightly scathed and amply sucked, but 
      almost everyone else, including his best boy friend and his true-love 
      girlfriend, gets dealt heavy-duty suicide. Even in this story we get an 
      inkling, right at the start, of a passion for living, literally, under 
      ground. (Whoops. Freudian slip there. In <I>Hardboiled Wonderland</I> the 
      underground enemies are translated as 'INKlings'.) In other stories the 
      underground may be moved up to the 16th floor of a supermodern hotel: just 
      once in a while, when you get out at that floor in the middle of the 
      night, you will find yourself in total darkness, there will be a smell of 
      mould, and somewhere down there, at the end of the corridor, one of the 
      Narrator's shuffling old chums, first rediscovered by an innocent young 
      receptionist who got off at the 16th floor at a bad moment, but also known 
      about by a psychic nymphet whom the Narrator has to escort back to Tokyo. 
      Who is the shuffler? The sheep man, shuffle, shuffle, he walks in the 
      scary dark. He has a few wise saws, wears a sheepskin coat, and is working 
      through a somewhat faded manual from Yorkshire, bearing on sheep 
      reproduction.</P>
      <P class=BT>The Narrator who most clearly chooses the underground is in 
      the book that is most admired in translation, <I>The Wind-Up Bird 
      Chronicle</I> (1999). He discovers a dried-up well in a haunted house next 
      to his. An Old Soldier tells him that once, while on a spying mission in 
      Mongolia, he was captured by a mad Soviet colonel who had him tied up and 
      tossed to the bottom of a dry well, and it was there that he had his 
      epiphany. So the Narrator decides to epiphanise in his neighbourhood well, 
      a dangerous undertaking because the neighbourhood nymphet has a nasty 
      habit of pulling up the ladder when he is asleep. Following the advice of 
      the Old Soldier, the Narrator gradually learns how to get into the Other 
      World, where his disappeared wife and/or cat may or may not be, but just 
      as he has figured it out, and has killed (in the Other World) his wife's 
      Evil Brother, and generally purified himself, the well, into which he has 
      crawled, suddenly comes to itself, and fills with water, in which said 
      Narrator is about to drown; luckily he is rescued two chapters later by 
      the brilliant, charming, but also Autistic Son of the woman who has been 
      hiring the Narrator to act as psychic guide to the confused matrons of 
      Tokyo, whose chauffeurs drive those Mercedes with the tinted windows. (She 
      has managed to have sex of a sort with him by licking a bluish spot that 
      grew on his cheek while he was in the well, when he was switching into 
      another reality, maybe. Her father, who worked in Manchuria during one of 
      the sorriest scenes in Japanese history, had an identical mark on his 
      face, which is the reason she hired the Narrator. By what I believe is 
      called dramatic foreshadowing the Autistic Son saves the day by taking the 
      slightly shamed Narrator to a shower, where he can wash and also replace 
      his soiled underpants, new ones being provided by management.) Meanwhile 
      the Narrator's wife, perhaps in this world, cuts off the life-support 
      system of the Evil Brother: a fact of which she informs the Narrator by 
      using the computer wired by the Autistic Son. And the damned spot got 
      removed in the purification scene at the bottom of the well, where the 
      Narrator was (probably) not drowning.</P>
      <P class=BT>I hope you see that Murakami was just the man to examine the 
      Tokyo gas attack: not just because of his fascination with the 
      underground, but also because he takes seriously both alternative 
      realities and the end of the world, possibly a major feature in the 
      thinking of the leaders of Aum Shinrikyo.</P>
      <P class=BT>Murakami decided to interview as many victims of the gas 
      attack as would co-operate. He wanted to find out what it was like to be 
      there. He thinks that Japanese society crashed, and that the attack forces 
      the question 'Where are we Japanese going?' It does not seem like that to 
      me, outsider though I am. I think that many people, indeed the entire 
      system, behaved quite well, even though a great deal of chaos was to be 
      expected. In one Tube train the station guards are heroes, and die. In 
      another an adolescent is assigned to clean up a carriage, and swabs it 
      carelessly, it stinks, and he callously retreats. Surely this is what it 
      is like to live in a great city.</P>
      <P class=BT>The doctor best qualified to advise on treatment for the 
      victims was supposed to be on holiday, but he wasn't, and as soon as he 
      got word of some sort of calamity in the Underground, he understood what 
      had happened and started faxing every hospital in Tokyo with precise 
      directives. Some of the hospitals reacted well. Others didn't. At one 
      hospital a woman walked into the emergency room with the pupils of her 
      eyes vanishing, a major symptom of sarin gas poisoning, and was told to 
      see an eye doctor. Such mismanagement seems to me to be expected. It 
      doesn't reveal anything about the Japanese psyche. It just shows that in a 
      great city in minor crisis some things will work serendipitously (the 
      sarin-expert doctor had not left for his holidays) and other things will 
      not work ('go see an eye-doctor, we can't help you'). I know it sounds 
      heartless to call this a minor crisis when it was experienced as a 
      catastrophe, as a breakdown of the social stability that Japan had come to 
      expect. Many aspects of the event were comparable to the recent explosion 
      in the Pushkin underpass in Moscow, except for the fact I have mentioned: 
      that everyone in Moscow knew pretty much what happened. My daughter missed 
      the Moscow explosion by half an hour, her destination being one of the 
      kiosks almost exactly where the bomb went off: because she was late she 
      saw only the emergency services in action. So when I say 'minor' I do not 
      in any way underestimate the terrible actual or potential grief to the 
      individuals or to the nation.</P>
      <P class=BT>One of Murakami's interviewees said she had lived for a year 
      in the US and she knew that people in New York would have behaved 
      differently. Yes, of course, a little differently, but significantly so? 
      Enough to alter the outcome? Recent letters to the <I>New York Times</I> 
      describe what happens in an airplane when a crisis is announced ('We have 
      just lost our landing gear'). In one such incident the entire passenger 
      cabin became totally silent; nobody did anything except tighten their seat 
      belts. In another the cabin filled with shrieks and cries of terror. An 
      interesting phenomenon: but there is no evidence of any correlation with 
      nations or their psyches.</P>
      <P class=BT>What <I>are</I> you supposed to do when a guard falls down 
      foaming at the mouth and something is going wrong with your breathing and 
      your vision? I understand from Internet browsing that a selfish person 
      would hold his breath, run to the surface, and on to the nearest Boots, 
      where he would grab a bottle of talcum power to sprinkle over all the 
      exposed parts of his body. Even flour is a pretty good idea, or a weak 
      solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium permanganate. But that isn't 
      exactly common knowledge, and it is wholly selfish. Is there a civil and 
      communitarian thing for an ordinary citizen to do, in the event of a gas 
      attack? No one seems to have any suggestions. Go back down there with a 
      case of talcum powder to neutralise the packages of gas? Not advised, 
      unless you really want to be a dead and probably ineffectual hero.</P>
      <P class=BT>Maybe people were just a little too ready to stick to their 
      routines. Many of the interviewees describe in great detail their subway 
      practices. Where they would get on, change, get off, which part of a train 
      they would go to in the hope of getting a seat. It was just an ordinary 
      morning. They started coughing. They should for their own good have left 
      the train at once, which many who were not interviewed apparently did. But 
      some stayed on for a while, following routine. I can't see that as part of 
      the Japanese psyche. I would probably have stayed on the train, because I 
      tend to put up with things; my wife, who refuses to, would probably have 
      got off. I got no sense, from Murakami's interviews, that people behaved 
      very differently from how the crowded throngs that come to work every 
      morning in so many great cities would have done.</P>
      <P class=BT>And what about Aum Shinrikyo? I have no sense, from the 
      interviews, of Aum, although it seems to me to resemble an American 
      Christian apocalyptic survival cult. The English version of Murakami's 
      book could have done with a knowledgable introduction by an expert. What I 
      have to say now would be well known to Japanese readers, but is not 
      available from this book. And I must emphasise that I am not an 
expert.</P>
      <P class=BT>There is a charismatic leader, a tradition of initiation and 
      renunciation, and an other-worldliness. The leader, who gave himself the 
      name of Shoko Asahara, was born in 1955. His new religion was established 
      with a dozen or so disciples in 1986. It is founded on an eclectic mix of 
      variants of Buddhism, especially Tibetan, with bits of esoteric Hindu 
      practices thrown in, as well as elements of Nostradamus and the Book of 
      Revelations. 'Shinrikyo' can be translated as 'teaching of the supreme 
      truth'. One connotation of 'Aum' - the deep breath sound used in some 
      yogic meditation - is 'powers of destruction and creation in the 
      universe'. It may seem strange that I call this group Buddhist, as 
      Buddhists have a pretty good world reputation for pacifism. A brief 
      translator's footnote directs us to Vajrayana Tantra, described as similar 
      to more conventional Buddhism, but offering a fast track to salvation, a 
      track that is held by some to condone murder. The chief god in the Aum 
      pantheon is Shiva, the god of destruction. Aum gained legal status as a 
      religious group in 1989.</P>
      <P class=BT>At first the group was much concerned with nuclear weapons, 
      and behaved like survivalists in the US. They wanted small communes with 
      nuclear shelters, food supplies and their own weaponry. But then they 
      turned their attention to more conventional matters. By 1989, according to 
      court proceedings, they began to murder people, starting with a young 
      lawyer (one of their critics), his wife and his baby. They were very much 
      concerned to make their own destiny, and their own weapons. They 
      established a plant to make a thousand imitation AK47s, plus bullets. They 
      succeeded in making some bad ones. Under the direction of a man with an MA 
      in organic chemistry, they were apparently able to manufacture sarin by 
      late 1993. A trial run was conducted in a small city in central Japan, 
      with the dual purpose of exterminating some judicial and administrative 
      figures who were investigating Aum, and of testing the gas. On 27 June 
      1994, seven people were killed and hundreds injured. Some cult members 
      were also eliminated around the same time. The police seem to have made a 
      hash of investigating the crime. They arrested a scapegoat, a man who used 
      to work for a small chemical firm, and whose hobby was gardening. His 
      potting shed was full of chemicals, probably gleaned from his employer. 
      The police interrogated him for months and he was reviled by the entire 
      country. Much the same happened when the police found bombs in Atlanta at 
      the time of the 1996 Olympic Games. They, too, arrested a scapegoat. On 
      the other hand, when the gardening chemist was finally cleared, the 
      Japanese media publicly apologised to him.</P>
      <P class=BT>Next question: why did this group want to gas the Tokyo 
      subway? The perpetrators, three of whom have been condemned to death, did 
      not talk to Murakami. Not surprising, but what did they think they were 
      doing? I examined other studies of Aum, but I did not find any that was 
      wholly convincing. Here is the closest. They were a millennial cult, who 
      wished for the end of the world, and the rebirth that each would 
      experience in a new world. They could hasten that happy day by leading 
      this world through a path of destruction. They were agents of reform, not 
      political but one might say metaphysical, who wanted to get to another 
      side of reality, and who could speed up the process by causing this side 
      to be destroyed more quickly.</P>
      <P class=BT>Aum is often grouped together with terrorist organisations, 
      but the classification is too coarse. One has to be careful: one cannot 
      say that terrorists have broadly political ambitions, while cultists have 
      spiritual ambitions. Aum did run candidates for Japanese elections a few 
      years before the attack. The difference lies in ultimate this-worldly as 
      opposed to other-worldly (or end-of-the world) ambitions or fantasies. 
      Murakami suggests that the other-worldly fantasy is deep in 'the Japanese 
      psyche'. I do not think he proves his case.</P>
      <P class=BT>Murakami is totally opposed to the them and us attitude taken 
      by the Japanese media: we are sane, Aum is crazy. He says, Aum and 'we' 
      belong to the same society. He offers an analogy. The young people who 
      went off to found the new state of Manchuria in the 1930s were idealists 
      who could create a new world (a subplot of <I>The Wind-Up Bird 
      Chronicle</I>). This is a topic on which Westerners have to reflect a 
      little, for we were brought up to believe that the Japanese assaults on 
      China and the north were unspeakable. They were. Murakami's point is that 
      they began in a high idealism, and a desire to get away from the Japanese 
      homeland to create a purer world. It turned into horror, in part because 
      of a lack of historical sense of what is attainable and what is not. It is 
      quite well known now that the Second World War suicide pilots were the 
      brightest and most idealistic of a cadre of university students. Murakami 
      suggests that the young people who joined Aum made the same type of error 
      as those earlier idealists.</P>
      <P class=BT>I find the comparisons between colonialism and cults somewhat 
      facile. It should not be surprising if the two pursue similar patterns in 
      Japan and the West. Japan decided to become a Western state in 1868, an 
      event in world history whose only close analogy was the decision of Peter 
      the Great to become European. Japan bought into everything, including 
      being a colonial master and having cults. They are not the same thing, 
      however. Exploiting colonies, or making them into idealised worlds, is a 
      perfectly rational strategy, even if the cruelties are deplorable, and the 
      contempt for the colonised despicable. Apocalyptic other-worldly cults, in 
      contrast, are crazy - I say in disagreement with Murakami. (Not that 
      'crazy' explains anything.) Apart from the idea of speeding up the end of 
      the world by mass murder, Aum, with its totally charismatic leader and 
      unhappy young people who become dedicated to the cause, does not look 
      importantly different from cults that horrify us in other parts of the 
      world. For a while, everything goes pretty swimmingly, but various 
      delusions build up in the mind of the leader which he is able to impose on 
      his followers. And then the communes crash in ways that strike the rest of 
      us as insane. This happens regularly. Jonesville. The Quebec-Swiss cult. 
      The recent case in Uganda. Some cults make it: it is sad that some young 
      people became Moonies, but it does not seem the worst thing in the world 
      to be a Moonie. Other cults are the worst thing in the world to join. Aum 
      developed into just such a cult. And yet Aum was different. It was not 
      into suicide; it was into random mass murder, or so it appears, mass 
      murder intended to hasten the end of the old world.</P>
      <P class=BT>Sometimes the cult worked better than one would expect. Like 
      many survivalists it wanted to be self-contained. It made its own guns 
      and, I think, its own bullet-proof vests. We have a report here of a young 
      man who was told to learn how to work as a magazine printer and 
      book-binder. So he worked for a few months in a print shop, and learned 
      his trade. Then he was brought back as an initiate, given truckloads of 
      obsolete and broken machinery and a dozen totally ignorant assistants, and 
      told to start publishing a magazine. The <I>LRB</I> would collapse in a 
      week with this strategy, but Aum pulled it off. So maybe they're not crazy 
      after all?</P>
      <P class=BT>The leader firmly believed he needed to be protected from 
      poison gas, and had many of his acolytes developing air-cleaning machines 
      (they sound like giant vacuum cleaners) which had to accompany him 
      everywhere. He set up a little state with ministries on the British system 
      (there was a ministry of science and technology, for example). Murakami 
      calls the members of Aum the &eacute;lite of Japanese society, but this needs 
      explanation for Westerners. Our word '&eacute;lite' has become incorporated into 
      standard Japanese, but with a shift in nuance. It applies to people who 
      get in to a certain group of top universities, or who work for top 
      corporations - they may in every other aspect of their lives be hopelessly 
      mediocre. There is an absolute hierarchy to Japanese educational 
      institutions, and a student who fails and drops out is (I am informed) 
      still called '&eacute;lite'. Aum deliberately recruited from what a Japanese 
      friend of mine calls 'brand name' establishments. Asahara himself tried 
      repeatedly to get in to one of the brand name universities and failed; 
      then he took up religion. Everyone was asking: 'How come these &eacute;lite 
      individuals joined Aum?' Murakami replies: 'Just because they were &eacute;lite.' 
      My friend suggests that the choice of the Kasumigaseki station as the 
      prime site for the attack suggests that this was an action against true 
      &eacute;lites (in the Western sense) on the part of drop-out &eacute;lites.</P>
      <P class=BT>Aum was made up of reasonably prosperous, reasonably educated 
      and unreasonably lonely young people in an eclectic society. 'Eclectic' 
      may be a key word. It applies to the language of Japan, and to the 
      writing. Perhaps here is something Japanese: you'll hear more Christmas 
      carols in the streets of Tokyo in December than anywhere else in the 
      world; but you can also go to a Shinto shrine the same day and see the new 
      cars being blessed by holy men with feather dusters to drive out evil 
      spirits. And then to spiritual places of every denomination, including 
      those in Kyoto which I think are the most moving on earth.</P>
      <P class=BT>What Westerners will not see is the explosion of eclectic 
      cults since 1950. It began much earlier, perhaps in the 1880s, but after 
      the war innumerable cults came into being and acquired many adherents. Aum 
      was very much a latecomer. From that perspective, it is merely an extreme 
      version of what was happening all over the nation. Perhaps the combination 
      of technological advance, materialism, money, crowds, rapid transit and 
      spirituality makes a cult that combines all those elements more possible 
      in Japan than anywhere else.</P>
      <P class=BT>Can we do anything to deal with apocalyptic cults? We don't 
      have a good record. The obvious thing would be to have the domestic spy 
      system, MI6 or whatever, infiltrate cults and find out what they are up 
      to. Well, maybe there have been endless such successes, and stories never 
      told, but it surely does not look like that. We cannot quite balance 
      democratic and security values. We don't want very odd religious groups 
      systematically spied on, but at the same time we do not want them to gas 
      us or to blow us up in the Tube. Balancing democracy and security was 
      particularly hard in postwar Japan, with its determination to be 
      respectful of its cults, and to count all of them, from an official point 
      of view, as legitimate religious bodies.</P>
      <P class=BT>Undoubtedly Japanese security could have been better. The 
      first sarin attack, in June 1994, took place in a little known town in 
      central Japan. The innocent man arrested by the police was held for a long 
      time; Aum was largely ignored. And even in 1989 at the time of the group's 
      first proven murder, an Aum badge was found at the scene of the crime, but 
      no arrests could be made - partly because the bodies of the three victims 
      had been hidden in different places in the mountains and were not found 
      for six years.</P>
      <P class=BT>We probably should not imagine that we are dealing with an 
      isolated cult whose privacy was overly respected by a not too competent 
      police force. One scenario turns these dark events into something worthy 
      of a Murakami novel. Aum may well be networked with a number of other 
      dastardly forces, including Yakuza - the Japanese Mafia - and some persons 
      in Very High Places. It has been suggested that the murder of the young 
      lawyer and his family was a joint enterprise, the Aum badge planted by 
      Yakuza to keep Aum in its place, while the police were hampered because 
      they were sure that the Very High Places were going to intervene in the 
      case. Maybe this is just the type of paranoid speculation that builds up 
      around a bizarre and terrifying story, but as I kept on looking into these 
      matters, I became convinced that there is a lot more to this grotesque 
      tale than has come out so far. None of these questions arises in 
      Murakami's book, but I thought readers might like a little more background 
      than he provides.</P>
      <P class=BT>To return to <I>Underground</I>: a further striking fact is 
      that despite the earlier sarin attack, only one subway passenger whom 
      Murakami interviewed knew right off what was happening: a woman in her 
      thirties who refused to have her name published in this book. 'This has to 
      be sarin,' she said. 'My pupils are contracted, aren't they?' She had 
      carefully read newspaper reports of the attack in June the previous year. 
      She was also one of the few who was astonished by the absence of panic. 
      'Everyone was so silent. No one uttered a word.' This may be one thing 
      which marks off the events in Tokyo from what might have happened in 
      similar circumstances in other parts of the world. Had there been a sarin 
      gas attack in Northampton, say, and one in London nine months later, many 
      people in London would have had a clearer idea of what was happening than 
      their Japanese counterparts. Murakami may be right to speak of a loss of 
      historical sense - something he has tried to counter in <I>The Wind-Up 
      Bird Chronicle</I> by incorporating bits of 1930-45 narrative. Perhaps 
      there was too much confidence that Japan had put itself back together, a 
      feeling that nothing bad would ever happen again.</P>
      <P class=BT>Perhaps that attitude should have changed after the Tokyo 
      attack, but it did not - and that may be one point Murakami wanted to 
      make. Aum and its members were reviled by the public. Although citizens 
      are constitutionally entitled to live where they choose, local authorities 
      don't allow Aum members to complete residence formalities. Asahara's trial 
      on 17 charges continues (it was in recess during the month of August when 
      I was writing this). Two men were condemned to death for the 1989 murders, 
      and this summer three more were sentenced to be hanged for their share in 
      the sarin attack. The cult must now report the number of its members every 
      three months. The most recent count was 1140 - a loss of ten members since 
      the previous report. About half live in Aum 'facilities', and the rest 
      privately, although often close together because it is so hard to find a 
      landlord who will rent to them. At its height there were some five 
      thousand members. The main Aum website in English continues to proselytise 
      and praise Asahara as if nothing had happened. Technically the 
      organisation is now called 'Aleph' but just type in the letters 'Aum 
      Shinrikyo' and you will find it instantly.</P><!-- #EndEditable -->
