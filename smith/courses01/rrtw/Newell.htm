    <div class="fr_body">MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN about Osama bin Laden's Islamic
 fundamentalism; less about the contribution of European Marxist postmodernism
to  bin Laden's thinking. In fact, the ideology by which al Qaeda justifies
its acts  of terror owes as much to baleful trends in Western thought as
it does to a  perversion of Muslim beliefs. Osama's doctrine of terror is
partly a Western  export. <br>
    <br>
To see this, it is necessary to revisit the intellectual brew  that produced
the ideology of Third World socialism in the 1960s. A key figure  here is
the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), who not only helped
 shape several generations of European leftists and founded postmodernism,
but  also was a leading supporter of the Nazis. Heidegger argued for the
primacy of  "peoples" in contrast with the alienating individualism of "modernity."
In order  to escape the yoke of Western capitalism and the "idle chatter"
of  constitutional democracy, the "people" would have to return to its primordial
 destiny through an act of violent revolutionary "resolve." <br>
    <br>
Heidegger saw  in the Nazis just this return to the blood-and-soil heritage
of the authentic  German people. Paradoxically, the Nazis embraced technology
at its most advanced  to shatter the iron cage of modernity and bring back
the purity of the distant  past. And they embraced terror and violence to
push beyond the modern  present--hence the term "postmodern"--and vault the
people back before  modernity, with its individual liberties and market economy,
to the imagined  collective austerity of the feudal age. <br>
    <br>
This vision of the postmodernist  revolution went straight from Heidegger
into the French postwar Left, especially  the works of Jean-Paul Sartre,
eager apologist for Stalinism and the Cultural  Revolution in China. Sartre's
prot g , the Algerian writer Frantz Fanon,  crystallized the Third World
variant of postmodernist revolution in "The  Wretched of the Earth" (1961).
From there, it entered the world of Middle  Eastern radicals. Many of the
leaders of the Shiite revolution in Iran that  deposed the modernizing shah
and brought the Ayatollah Khomeini to power in 1979  had studied Fanon's
brand of Marxism. Ali Shari'at, the Sorbonne-educated  Iranian sociologist
of religion considered by many the intellectual father of  the Shiite revolution,
translated "The Wretched of the Earth" and Sartre's  "Being and Nothingness
into Persian." The Iranian revolution was a synthesis of  Islamic fundamentalism
and European Third World socialism. <br>
    <br>
In the  postmodernist leftism of these revolutionaries, the "people" supplanted
Marx's  proletariat as the agent of revolution. Following Heidegger and Fanon,
leaders  like Lin Piao, ideologist of the Red Guards in China, and Pol Pot,
student of  leftist philosophy in France before becoming a founder of the
Khmer Rouge,  justified revolution as a therapeutic act by which non-Western
peoples would  regain the dignity they had lost to colonial oppressors and
to American-style  materialism, selfishness, and immorality. A purifying
violence would purge the  people of egoism and hedonism and draw them back
into a primitive collective of  self-sacrifice. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
MANY ELEMENTS in the ideology of al Qaeda--set  forth most clearly in Osama
bin Laden's 1996 "Declaration of War Against  America"--derive from this
same mix. Indeed, in Arab intellectual circles today,  bin Laden is already
being likened to an earlier icon of Third World revolution  who renounced
a life of privilege to head for the mountains and fight the  American oppressor,
Che Guevara. According to Cairo journalist Issandr Elamsani,  Arab leftist
intellectuals still see the world very much in 1960s terms. "They  are all
ex-Sorbonne, old Marxists," he says, "who look at everything through a  postcolonial
prism." <br>
    <br>
Just as Heidegger wanted the German people to  return to a foggy, medieval,
blood-and-soil collectivism purged of the  corruptions of modernity, and
just as Pol Pot wanted Cambodia to return to the  Year Zero, so does Osama
dream of returning his world to the imagined purity of  seventh-century Islam.
And just as Fanon argued that revolution can never  accomplish its goals
through negotiation or peaceful reform, so does Osama  regard terror as good
in itself, a therapeutic act, quite apart from any  concrete aim. The willingness
to kill is proof of one's purity.  <br>
    <br>
According to journalist Robert Worth, writing in the New York Times on  the
intellectual roots of Islamic terror, bin Laden is poorly educated in  Islamic
theology. A wealthy playboy in his youth, he fell under the influence of
 radical Arab intellectuals of the 1960s who blended calls for Marxist revolution
 with calls for a pure Islamic state. <br>
    <br>
Many of these men were imprisoned  and executed for their attacks on Arab
regimes; Sayyid Qutb, for example, a  major figure in the rise of Islamic
fundamentalism, was executed in Egypt in  1965. But their ideas lived on.
Qutb's intellectual progeny included Fathi  Yakan, who likened the coming
Islamic revolution to the French and Russian  revolutions, Abdullah Azzam,
a Palestinian activist killed in a car bombing in  1989, and Safar Al-Hawali,
a Saudi fundamentalist frequently jailed by the Saudi  government. As such
men dreamed of a pure Islamic state, European revolutionary  ideology was
seldom far from their minds. Wrote Fathi Yakan, "The groundwork for  the
French Revolution was laid by Rousseau, Voltaire and Montesquieu; the  Communist
Revolution realized plans set by Marx, Engels and Lenin....The same  holds
true for us as well." <br>
    <br>
The influence of Qutb's "Signposts on the  Road" (1964) is clearly traceable
in pronouncements by Islamic Jihad, the group  that would justify its assassination
of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in 1981  as a step toward ending American
domination of Egypt and ushering in a pure  Islamic order. In the 1990s,
Islamic Jihad would merge with al Qaeda, and  Osama's "Declaration of War
Against America" in turn would show an obvious debt  to the Islamic Jihad
manifesto "The Neglected Duty." <br>
    <br>
It can be argued,  then, that the birthplace of Osama's brand of terrorism
was Paris 1968, when,  amid the student riots and radical teach-ins, the
influence of Sartre, Fanon,  and the new postmodernist Marxist champions
of the "people's destiny" was at its  peak. By the mid '70s, according to
Claire Sterling's "The Terror Network,"  "practically every terrorist and
guerrilla force to speak of was represented in  Paris. . . . The Palestinians
especially were there in force." This was the  heyday of Yasser Arafat's
terrorist organization Al Fatah, whose 1968 tract "The  Revolution and Violence"
has been called "a selective precis of 'The Wretched of  the Earth.'" <br>
    <br>
While Al Fatah occasionally still used the old-fashioned  Leninist language
of class struggle, the increasingly radical groups that  succeeded it perfected
the melding of Islamism and Third World socialism. Their  tracts blended
Heidegger and Fanon with calls to revive a strict Islamic social  order.
"We declare," says the Shiite terrorist group Hezbollah in its "Open  Letter
to the Downtrodden in Lebanon and the World" (1985), "that we are a  nation
that fears only God" and will not accept "humiliation from America and  its
allies and the Zionist entity that has usurped the sacred Islamic land."
The  aim of violent struggle is "giving all our people the opportunity to
determine  their fate." But that fate must follow the prescribed course:
"We do not hide  our commitment to the rule of Islam, . . . which alone guarantees
justice and  dignity for all and prevents any new imperialist attempt to
infiltrate our  country. . . . This Islamic resistance must . . . with God's
help receive from  all Muslims in all parts of the world utter support."
    <br>
    <br>
These 1980s calls  to revolution could have been uttered last week by Osama
bin Laden. Indeed, the  chief doctrinal difference between the radicals of
several decades ago and Osama  only confirms the influence of postmodernist
socialism on the latter: Whereas  Qutb and other early Islamists looked mainly
inward, concentrating on revolution  in Muslim countries, Osama directs his
struggle primarily outward, against  American hegemony. While for the early
revolutionaries, toppling their own  tainted regimes was the principal path
to the purified Islamic state, for Osama,  the chief goal is bringing America
to its knees. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
THE  RELATIONSHIP between postmodernist European leftism and Islamic radicalism
is a  two-way street: Not only have Islamists drawn on the legacy of the
European  Left, but European Marxists have taken heart from Islamic terrorists
who seemed  close to achieving the longed-for revolution against American
hegemony. Consider  Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, two leading avatars
of postmodernism.  Foucault was sent by the Italian daily Corriere della
Sera to observe the  Iranian revolution and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini.
Like Sartre, who had  rhapsodized over the Algerian revolution, Foucault
was enthralled, pronouncing  Khomeini "a kind of mystic saint." The Frenchman
welcomed "Islamic government"  as a new form of "political spirituality"
that could inspire Western radicals to  combat capitalist hegemony. <br>
    <br>
Heavily influenced by Heidegger and Sartre,  Foucault was typical of postmodernist
socialists in having neither concrete  political aims nor the slightest interest
in tangible economic grievances as  motives for revolution. To him, the appeal
of revolution was aesthetic and  voyeuristic: "a violence, an intensity,
an utterly remarkable passion." For  Foucault as for Fanon, Hezbollah, and
the rest down to Osama, the purpose of  violence is not to relieve poverty
or adjust borders. Violence is an end in  itself. Foucault exalts it as "the
craving, the taste, the capacity, the  possibility of an absolute sacrifice."
In this, he is at one with Osama's  followers, who claim to love death while
the Americans "love Coca-Cola."  <br>
    <br>
Derrida, meanwhile, reacted to the collapse of the Soviet Union by  calling
for a "new international." Whereas the old international was made up of  the
economically oppressed, the new one would be a grab bag of the culturally
 alienated, "the dispossessed and the marginalized": students, feminists,
 environmentalists, gays, aboriginals, all uniting to combat American-led
 globalization. Islamic fundamentalists were obvious candidates for inclusion.
 <br>
    <br>
And so it is that in the latest leftist potboiler, "Empire," Michael  Hardt
and Antonio Negri depict the American-dominated global order as today's  version
of the bourgeoisie. Rising up against it is Derrida's "new  international."
Hardt and Negri identify Islamist terrorism as a spearhead of  "the postmodern
revolution" against "the new imperial order." Why? Because of  "its refusal
of modernity as a weapon of Euro-American hegemony."  <br>
    <br>
"Empire" is currently flavor of the month among American postmodernists.
 It is almost eerily appropriate that the book should be the joint production
of  an actual terrorist, currently in jail, and a professor of literature
at Duke,  the university that led postmodernism's conquest of American academia.
In  professorial hands, postmodernism is reduced to a parlor game in which
we  "deconstruct" great works of the past and impose our own meaning on them
without  regard for the authors' intentions or the truth or falsity of our
 interpretations. This has damaged liberal education in America. Still, it
 doesn't kill people--unlike the deadly postmodernism out there in the world.
 Heirs to Heidegger and his leftist devotees, the terrorists don't limit
 themselves to deconstructing texts. They want to deconstruct the West, through
 acts like those we witnessed on September 11. <br>
    <br>
What the terrorists have  in common with our armchair nihilists is a belief
in the primacy of the radical  will, unrestrained by traditional moral teachings
such as the requirements of  prudence, fairness, and reason. The terrorists
seek to put this belief into  action, shattering tradition through acts of
violent revolutionary resolve. That  is how al Qaeda can ignore mainstream
Islam, which prohibits the deliberate  killing of noncombatants, and slaughter
innocents in the name of creating a new  world, the latest in a long line
of grimly punitive collectivist utopias.  <br>
