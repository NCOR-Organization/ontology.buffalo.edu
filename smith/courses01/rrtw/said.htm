  <B>God Has Ninety-Nine Names: Reporting From a Militant Middle East.</B><BR>By 
  Judith Miller.<BR>Simon &amp; Schuster. 574 pp. $30. 
  <HR>

  <P>Judith Miller is a <I>New York Times</I> reporter much in evidence on talk 
  shows and seminars on the Middle East. She trades in "the Islamic threat" -- 
  her particular mission has been to advance the millennial thesis that militant 
  Islam is a danger to the West. The search for a post-Soviet foreign devil has 
  come to rest, as it did beginning in the eighth century for European 
  Christendom, on Islam, a religion whose physical proximity and unstilled 
  challenge to the West seem as diabolical and violent now as they did then. 
  Never mind that most Islamic countries today are too poverty-stricken, 
  tyrannical and hopelessly inept militarily as well as scientifically to be 
  much of a threat to anyone except their own citizens; and never mind that the 
  most powerful of them -- like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Pa kistan -- are 
  totally within the U.S. orbit. What matters to "experts" like Miller, Samuel 
  Huntington, Martin Kramer, Bernard Lewis, Daniel Pipes, Steven Emerson and 
  Barry Rubin, plus a whole battery of Israeli academics, is to make sure that 
  the "threat" is kept before our eyes, the better to excoriate Islam for 
  terror, despotism and violence, while assuring themselves profitable 
  consultancies, frequent TV appearances and book contracts. The Islamic threat 
  is made to seem disproportionately fearsome, lending support to the thesis 
  (which is an interesting parallel to anti-Semitic paranoia) that there is a 
  worldwide conspiracy behind every explosion. 
  <P>Political Islam has generally been a failure wherever it has tried to take 
  state power. Iran is a possible exception, but neither Sudan, already an 
  Islamic state, nor Algeria, riven by the contest between Islamic groups and a 
  brutal soldiery, has done anything but make itself poorer and more marginal on 
  the world stage. Lurking beneath the discourse of Islamic peril in the West 
  is, however, some measure of truth, which is that appeals to Islam among 
  Muslims have fueled resistance (in the style of what Eric Hobsbawm has called 
  primitive, pre-industrial rebellion) to the Pax Americana-Israelica throughout 
  the Middle East. Yet neither Hezbollah nor Hamas has presented a serious 
  obstacle to the ongoing steamroller of the anything-but-peace process. Most 
  Arab Muslims today are too discouraged and humiliated, and also too 
  anesthetized by uncertainty and their incompetent and crude dictatorships, to 
  support anything like a vast Islamic campaign against the West. Besides, the 
  elites are for the most part in cahoots with the regimes, supporting martial 
  law and other extralegal measures against "extremists." So why, then, the 
  accents of alarm and fear in most discussions of Islam? Of course there have 
  been suicide bombings and outrageous acts of terrorism, but have they 
  accomplished anything except to strengthen the hand of Israel and the United 
  States and their client regimes in the Muslim world? 
  <P>The answer, I think, is that books like Miller's are symptomatic because 
  they are weapons in the contest to subordinate, beat down, compel and defeat 
  any Arab or Muslim resistance to U.S.-Israeli dominance. Moreover, by 
  surreptitiously justifying a policy of single-minded obduracy that links 
  Islamism to a strategically important, oil-rich part of the world, the 
  anti-Islam campaign virtually eliminates the possibility of equal dialogue 
  between Islam and the Arabs, and the West or Israel. To demonize and 
  dehumanize a whole culture on the ground that it is (in Lewis's sneering 
  phrase) enraged at modernity is to turn Muslims into the objects of a 
  therapeutic, punitive attention. I do not want to be misunderstood here: The 
  manipulation of Islam, or for that matter Christianity or Judaism, for 
  retrograde political purposes is catastrophically bad and must be opposed, not 
  just in Saudi Arabia, the West Bank and Gaza, Pakistan, Sudan, Algeria and 
  Tunisia but also in Israel, among the right-wing Christians in Lebanon (for 
  whom Miller shows an unseemly sympathy) and wherever theocratic tendencies 
  appear. And I do not at all believe that all the ills of Muslim countries are 
  due to Zionism and imperialism. But this is very far from saying that Israel 
  and the United States, and their intellectual flacks, have not played a 
  combative, even incendiary role in stigmatizing and heaping invidious abuse on 
  an abstraction called "Islam," deliberately in order to stir up feelings of 
  anger and fear about Islam among Americans and Europeans, who are also 
  enjoined to see in Israel a secular, liberal alternative. Miller says 
  unctuously at the beginning of her book that right-wing Judaism in Israel is 
  "the subject of another book." It is actually very much part of the book that 
  she has written, except that she has willfully suppressed it in order to go 
  after "Islam." 
  <P>Writing about any other part of the world, Miller would be considered 
  woefully unqualified. She tells us that she has been involved with the Middle 
  East for twenty-five years, yet she has little knowledge of either Arabic or 
  Persian. It would be impossible to be taken seriously as a reporter or expert 
  on Russia, France, Germany or Latin America, perhaps even China or Japan, 
  without knowing the requisite languages, but for "Islam," linguistic knowledge 
  is unnecessary since what one is dealing with is considered to be a 
  psychological deformation, not a "real" culture or religion. 
  <P>What of her political and historical information? Each of the ten country 
  chapters (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan) begins with an anecdote and moves 
  immediately to a potted history that reflects not much more than the work of a 
  name-dropping college sophomore. Cobbled up out of various, not always 
  reliable authorities (her pages of footnotes are tainted by her ignorance, 
  whether because she can only cite the sources she already knows she wants in 
  English, or because she quotes only authorities whose views correspond to 
  hers, thereby closing out an entire library by Muslims, Arabs and 
  non-Orientalist scholars), these histories are meant principally to display 
  her command of the material, but actually expose her lamentable prejudices and 
  failures of comprehension. In the Saudi Arabia chapter, for instance, she 
  informs us in a note that her "favorite" source on the Prophet Mohammed is the 
  French Orientalist Maxime Rodinson, a redoubtable Marxist scholar whose 
  biography of the Prophet is written with a bracing combination of 
  anti-clerical irony and enormous erudition. What Miller gets from this in her 
  short summary of Mohammed's life and ideas is that there is something 
  inherently risible, if not contemptible, about the man whom Rodinson says was 
  a combination of Charlemagne and Jesus Christ; for whereas Rodinson 
  understands what that means, Miller tells us (irrelevantly) that she is not 
  convinced. For her, Mohammed is the begetter of an anti-Jewish religion, one 
  laced with violence and paranoia. She does not directly quote one Muslim 
  source on Mohammed; just imagine a book published in the United States on 
  Jesus or Moses that makes no use of a single Christian or Judaic authority. 
  <P>Most of Miller's book is made up not of argument and ideas but of endless 
  interviews with what seems to be a slew of pathetic, unconvincing, 
  self-serving scoundrels and their occasional critics. Once past her little 
  histories we are adrift in boring, unstructured meanderings. Here's a typical 
  sentence of insubstantial generalization: "And Syrians, mindful of their 
  country's chaotic history" (of what country on earth is this not also true?) 
  "found the prospect of a return to anarchy or yet another prolonged, bloody 
  power struggle -- " (is this uniquely true of Syria as a postcolonial state, 
  or is it true of a hundred others in Asia, Africa, Latin America?) "and 
  perhaps even the triumph of militant Islam in the most secular" (with what 
  thermometer did she get that reading?) "of all Arab states -- alarming." Leave 
  aside the abominable diction and jaw-shattering jargon of the writing. What 
  you have is not an idea at all but a series of clichés mixed with unverifiable 
  assertions that reflect the "thought" of "Syrians" much less than they do 
  Miller's. 
  <P>Miller gilds her paper-thin descriptions with the phrase "my friend," which 
  she uses to convince her reader that she really knows the people and 
  consequently what she is talking about. I counted 247 uses of the phrase 
  before I stopped about halfway through the book. This technique produces 
  extraordinary distortions in the form of long digressions that testify to an 
  Islamic mindset, even as they obscure or ignore more or at least equally 
  relevant material like local politics, the functioning of secular institutions 
  and the active intellectual contest taking place between Islamists and 
  nationalist opponents. She seems never to have heard of Arkoun, or Jabri, or 
  Tarabishi, or Adonis, or Hanafi or Djeit, whose theses are hotly debated all 
  over the Islamic world. 
  <P>This appalling failure of analysis is especially true in the chapter on 
  Israel (mistitled, since it is all about Palestine), where she ignores the 
  changes caused by the <I>intifada</I> and the prolonged effect of the 
  three-decade Israeli occupation, and conveys no sense of the abominations 
  wrought on the lives of ordinary Palestinians by the Oslo accords and Yasir 
  Arafat's one-man rule. Although Miller is obsessed with Hamas, she is clearly 
  unable to connect it with the sorry state of affairs in territories run 
  brutally by Israel for all these years. She never mentions, for instance, that 
  the only Palestinian university not established with Palestinian funds is 
  Gaza's Islamic (Hamas) University, started by Israel to undermine the P.L.O. 
  during the <I>intifada</I>. She records Mohammed's depredations against the 
  Jews but has little to say about Israeli beliefs, statements and laws against 
  "non-Jews," often rabbinically sanctioned practices of deportation, killing, 
  house demolition, land confiscation, annexation and what Sara Roy has called 
  systematic economic de-development. If in her breathlessly excitable way 
  Miller sprinkles around a few of these facts, nowhere does she accord them the 
  weight and influence as causes of Islamist passion that they undoubtedly have. 

  <P>Maddeningly, she informs us of everyone's religion -- such and so is 
  Christian, or Muslim Sunni, Muslim Shiite, etc. Even so, she is not always 
  accurate, managing to produce some howlers. She speaks of Hisham Sharabi as a 
  friend but misidentifies him as a Christian; he is Sunni Muslim. Badr el Haj 
  is described as Muslim whereas he is Maronite Christian. These lapses wouldn't 
  be so bad were she not bent on revealing her intimacy with so many people. And 
  then there is her bad faith in not identifying her own religious background or 
  political predilections. Are we meant to assume that her religion (which I 
  don't think is Islam or Hinduism) is irrelevant? 
  <P>She is embarrassingly forthcoming, however, about her reactions to people 
  and power and certain events. She is "grief-stricken" when King Hussein of 
  Jordan is diagnosed with cancer, although she scarcely seems to mind that he 
  runs a police state whose many victims have been tortured, unfairly 
  imprisoned, done away with. One realizes of course that what counts here is 
  her hobnobbing with the little King, but some accurate sense of the "modern" 
  kingdom he rules would have been in order. Her eyes "filled with tears -- of 
  rage" as she espies evidence of desecration of a Lebanese Christian mosaic, 
  but she doesn't bother to mention other desecrations in Israel -- for example, 
  of Muslim graveyards -- and hundreds of exterminated villages in Syria, 
  Lebanon, Palestine. Her real contempt and disdain come out in passages like 
  the following, in which she imputes thoughts and wishes to a middle-class 
  Syrian woman whose daughter has just become an Islamist: 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>She would never have any of the things a middle-class Syrian 
    mother yearned for: no grand wedding party and traditional white dress with 
    diamond tiara for her daughter, no silver-framed photos of the happy wedding 
    couple in tuxedo and bridal gown on the coffee table and fireplace mantel, 
    no belly dancers wriggling on a stage and champagne that flowed till dawn. 
    Perhaps Nadine's friends, too, had daughters or sons who had rejected them, 
    who secretly despised them for the compromises they had made to win the 
    favor of Assad's cruel and soulless regime. For if the daughter of such 
    pillars of the Damascene bourgeoisie could succumb to the power of Islam, 
    who was immune?</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Such snide accounts trivialize and cheapen the people whose houses and 
  privacy she has invaded. 
  <P>Given her willingness to undercut even her friendly sources, the most 
  interesting question about Miller's book is why she wrote it at all. Certainly 
  not out of affection. Consider, for instance, that she admits she fears and 
  dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry 
  for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She is 
  relentlessly concerned only with the dangers of organized Islamic militancy, 
  which I would hazard a guess accounts for less than 5 percent of the 
  billion-strong Islamic world. She supports the violent suppression of 
  Islamists (but not torture and other "illegal means" used in that suppression; 
  she misses the contradiction in her position), has no qualms about the absence 
  of democratic practices or legal procedures in Palestine, Egypt or Jordan so 
  long as Islamists are the target and, in one especially nauseating scene, she 
  actually participates in the prison interrogation of an alleged Muslim 
  terrorist by Israeli policemen, whose systematic use of torture and other 
  questionable procedures (undercover assassinations, middle-of-the-night 
  arrests, house demolitions) she politely overlooks as she gets to ask the 
  handcuffed man a few questions of her own. 
  <P>Perhaps Miller's most consistent failing as a journalist is that she only 
  makes connections and offers analyses of matters that suit her thesis about 
  the militant, hateful quality of the Arab world. I have little quarrel with 
  the general view that the Arab world is in a dreadful state, and have said so 
  repeatedly for the past three decades. But she barely registers the existence 
  of a determined anti-Arab and anti-Islamic U.S. policy. She plays fast and 
  loose with fact. Take Lebanon: She refers to Bashir Gemayel's assassination in 
  1982 and gives the impression that he was elected by a popular landslide. She 
  does not even allude to the fact that he was brought to power while the 
  Israeli army was in West Beirut, just before the Sabra and Shatila camp 
  massacres, and that for years, according to Israeli sources like Uri Lubrani, 
  Gemayel was the Mossad's man in Lebanon. That he was a self-proclaimed killer 
  and a thug is also finessed, as is the fact that Lebanon's current power 
  structure is chock-full of people like Elie Hobeika, who was charged directly 
  for the camp massacres. Miller cites instances of Arab anti-Semitism but 
  doesn't even touch on the matter of Israeli leaders like Begin, Shamir, Eitan 
  and, more recently, Ehud Barak (idolized by Amy Wilentz in <I>The New 
  Yorker</I>) referring to Palestinians as two-legged beasts, grasshoppers, 
  cockroaches and mosquitoes. These leaders have used planes and tanks to treat 
  Palestinians accordingly. As for the facts of Israel's wars against civilians 
  -- the protracted, consistent and systematic campaign against prisoners of war 
  and refugee camp dwellers, the village destructions and bombings of hospitals 
  and schools, the deliberate creation of hundreds of thousands of refugees -- 
  all these are buried in reams of prattle. Miller disdains facts; she prefers 
  quoting interminable talk as a way of turning Arabs into deserving victims of 
  Israeli terror and U.S. support of it. She perfectly exemplifies <I>The New 
  York</I> <I>Times</I>'s current Middle East coverage, now at its lowest ebb. 
  <P>In her lame conclusion Miller admits that her scolding may have been a 
  little too harsh. She then puts it all down to her "love" of the region and 
  its people. I cannot honestly think of a thing that she loves: not the 
  conformism of Arab society she talks about, or the ostentatious culinary 
  display she says that the Arabs confuse with hospitality, or the languages she 
  hasn't learned, or the people she makes fun of or the history and culture of a 
  place that to her is one long tale of unintelligible sound and fury. She 
  cannot enter into the life of the place, listen to its conversations directly, 
  read its novels and plays on her own (as opposed to making friends with their 
  authors), enjoy the energy and refinements of its social life or see its 
  landscapes. But this is the price of being a <I>Times</I> reporter in an age 
  of sullen "expertise" and instant position-taking. You wouldn't know from 
  Miller's book that there is any inter-Arab conflict in interpretations and 
  representations of the Middle East and Islam and that, given her choice of 
  sources, she is deeply partisan: an enemy of Arab nationalism, which she 
  declares dead numerous times in the book; a supporter of U.S. policy; and a 
  committed foe of any Palestinian nationalism that doesn't conform to the 
  bantustans being set up according to the Oslo accords. Miller, in short, is a 
  shallow, opinionated journalist whose gigantic book is too long for what it 
  ends up saying, and far too short on reflection, considered analysis, 
  structure and facts. Poor Muslims and Arabs who may have trusted her; they 
  should have known better than to mistake an insinuated guest for a friend.
