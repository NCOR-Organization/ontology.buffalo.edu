I've given this talk the title of Our Universal        Civilization. It is
a rather big title, and I am a little embarrassed by        it. I feel I
should explain how it came about. I have no unifying theory        of things.
To me situations and people are always specific, always of        themselves.
That is why one travels and writes: to find out. To work in        the other
way would be to know the answers before one knew the problems.        That
is a recognized way of working, I know, especially if one is a        political
or religious or racial missionary. But I would have found it        hard. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">That was
why I thought, when this invitation to talk came, that it        would be
better for me to find out what kind of issues members of the        Institute
were interested in. Myron Magnet, a senior fellow of the        Institute,
was in England at the time. We talked on the telephone; and        then,
some days later, he sent me a handwritten list of questions. They       
were very serious questions, very important. Are we&#8212;are communities&#8212;as  
     strong only as our beliefs? Is it enough for beliefs or an ethical view
to        be passionately held? Does the passion give validity to the ethics?
Are        beliefs or ethical views arbitrary, or do they represent something
       essential in the cultures where they flourish?       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">It was
easy to read through to some of the anxieties that lay behind        the
questions. There was a clear worry about certain fanaticisms "out       
there." At the same there was a certain philosophical difference about how
       that anxiety could be expressed, since no one wants to use words or
       concepts that might boomerang on himself. You know how words can be
used:        I am civilized and steadfast; you are barbarian and fanatical;
he is        primitive and blind. Of course, I was on the side of the questioner,
and        understood his drift. But I got to feel, over the next few days,
and        perhaps from my somewhat removed position, that I couldn't share
the        pessimism implied by the questions. I felt that the very pessimism
of the        questions, and their philosophical diffidence, defined the
strength of the        civilization out of which it issued. And so the theme
of my talk, Our        Universal Civilization, was given me.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">I am not
going to attempt to define this civilization. I will only        speak of
it in a personal way. It is the civilization, first of all, which       
gave me the idea of the writing vocation. It is the civilization in which
       I have been able to practise my vocation as a writer. To be a writer,
you        need to start with a certain kind of sensibility. The sensibility
itself        is created, or given direction, by an intellectual atmosphere. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Sometimes
an atmosphere can be too refined, a civilization too        achieves, too
ritualized. Eleven years ago, when I was travelling in Java,        I met
a young man who wanted above everything else to be a poet and to        live
the life of the mind. This ambition had been given him by his modern    
   education; but it was hard for the young man to explain to his mother
       exactly what he was up to. This mother was a person of culture and
       elegance; that should be stressed. She was elegant in visage and dress
and        speech; her manners were like art; they were Javanese court manners. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">So I asked
the young man&#8212;bearing in mind that we were in java, where        ancient
epics live on in the popular art of puppet plays&#8212;"But isn't your        mother
secretly proud that you are a poet?" He said in English&#8212;I mention       
this to give a further measure of his education in his far-off Javanese  
     town&#8212;"She wouldn't have even a sense of what being a poet is."     
 </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
And the poet's friend and mentor, a teacher at the local        university
amplified this. The friend said, "The only way he would have of        making
the mother understand what he is trying to do would be to suggest       
that he is being a poet in the classical tradition. And she would find  
     this absurd. The would reject it as an impossibility." It would be  
     rejected an impossibility, because for the poet's mother the epics of
her        country&#8212;and to her they would have been like sacred texts&#8212;already
existed,        had already been written.       </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
They had only to be learnt or consulted.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">For the
mother, all poetry had already been written. That particular        book,
it might be said, was closed: it was part of the perfection of her      
 culture. To be told by her son, who was 28, not all that young, that he
       was hoping to be a poet would be like a devout mother in another culture
       asking her writer son what he intended to write next, and getting
the        reply, "I am thinking of adding a book to the Bible." Or, to attempt
       another comparison, the young man would be like the character in the
story        by Borges who had taken on himself the task of rewriting Don
Quijote. Not        just retelling the story, or copying out the Cervantes
original; but        seeking, by an extraordinary process of mind-clearing
and recreation, to        arrive&#8212;without copying or falsity, and purely through
original thought&#8212;at        a narrative coinciding word by word with the Cervantes
book.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">I understood
the predicament of the young man in Central Java. His        background,
after all, was not far removed from the Hindu aspect of my own        Trinidad
background. We were an agricultural immigrant community from        India.
The ambition to become a writer, the introduction to writing and        ideas
about writing, had been given me by my father. He was born in 1906,     
  the grandson of someone who had come to Trinidad as a baby. And somehow,
       in spite of all the discouragements of the society of that small  
     agricultural colony, the wish to be a writer had come to my father;
and he        had made himself into a journalist, even with the limited opportunities
       for journalism that existing in that colony.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">We were
a people of ritual and sacred texts. We also had our epics&#8212;and        they
were the very epics of Java; we heard them constantly sung or        chanted.
But it couldn't be said that we were a literary people. Our        literature,
our texts, didn't commit us to an exploration of our world;        rather,
they were cultural markers, giving us a sense of the wholeness of       
our world; and the alienness of what lay outside. I don't believe that, in
       his family, anyone before my father would have thought of original
       literary composition. That idea came to my father in Trinidad with
the        English language; somehow, in spite of the colonial discouragements
of the        place, an idea of the high civilization connected with the
language came        to my father; and he was given some knowledge of literary
forms.        Sensibility is not enough if you are going to be a writer.
You need to        arrive at the forms that can contain or carry your sensibility;
and        literary forms&#8212;whether in poetry or drama, or prose fiction&#8212;are
       artificial, and ever changing.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">This was
a part of what was passed on to me at a very early age. At a        very
early age&#8212;in all the poverty and bareness of Trinidad, far away, with   
    a population of half a million&#8212;I was given the ambition to write books,
       and specifically to write novels, which my father had presented to
me as        the highest form. But books are not created just in the mind.
Books are        physical objects. To write them, you need a certain kind
of sensibility;        you need a language, and a certain gift of language;
and you need to        possess a particular literary form. To get your name
on the spine of the        created physical object, you need a vast apparatus
outside yourself. You        need publishers, editors, designers, printers,
binder; booksellers,        critics, newspapers and magazines and television
where the critics can say        what they think of the book; and, of course,
buyers and readers.       </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
I want to stress this mundane side of things, because it is        easy to
take it for granted; it is easy to think of writing only in its        personal,
romantic aspect. Writing is a private act; but the published        book,
when it starts to live, speakers of the cooperation of a particular     
  kind of society. They society has a certain degree of commercial      
 organization. It also has certain cultural or imaginative needs. It    
   doesn't believe that all poetry has already been written. It needs new
       stimuli, new writing; and it has the means of judging the new things
that        are offered.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">This kind
of society didn't exist in Trinidad. It was necessary,        therefore,
if I was going to be a writer, and live by my books, to travel        out
to that kind of society where the writing life was possible. This       
meant, for me at that time, going to England. I was travelling from the  
     periphery, the margin, to what to me was the center; and it&#8212;was my hope
       that, at the center, room would be made for me. I was asking a lot,
       asking, in fact, more of the center than of my own society. The center,
       after all, had its own interests, its own world-view, its own ideas
of        what it wanted in novels. And it still does. My subjects were far-off:
but        a little room was made for me in the England of the 1950s. I was
able to        become a writer, and to grow in the profession. It took time;
I was        forty&#8212;and had been publishing in England for fifteen years&#8212;before
a book        of mine was seriously published in the United States.     
 </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
But I always recognized, in England in the 1950s, that as        someone
with a writing vocation there was nowhere else for me to go. And        if
I have to describe the universal civilization I would say it is the     
  civilization that both gave the prompting and the idea of the literary
       vocation; and also gave the means to fulfill that prompting; the  
     civilization that enable me to make that journey from the periphery
to the        center; the civilization that links me not only to this audience
but also        that now not-so-young man in Java whose background was as
ritualized as my        own, and on whom&#8212;as on me&#8212;the outer world had worked,
and given the        ambition to write.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">It is easier
today for someone setting out to be a writer from places        like Jave
or Trinidad; subjects once far-off are no longer so. But I have        never
been able to take my career for granted. T 'know that there are        still
large tracts of the world where the cultural or economic conditions     
  I described a while ago do not obtain, and someone like myself would not
       have been able to become a writer. I couldn't have become the kind
of        writer I am in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union or black Africa.
I don't        think I could have taken my gifts even to India.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">You will
understand, then, how important it was to me to know when I        was young
that I could make this journey from the margin to the center,        from
Trinidad to London. The ambition to be a writer assumed that this was   
    possible. So, in fact, I was taking it for granted, in spite of my  
     ancestry and Trinidad background, that with another, equally important
       part of myself I was part of a larger civilization. I suppose the
same        could be said of my father, though lie was closer to the ritual
ways of        our Hindu and Indian past.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">But I never
formulated the idea of the universal civilization until        quite recently&#8212;until
eleven years ago, when I travelled for many months in        a number of
non-Arab Muslim countries to try to understand what had driven        them
to their rage. That Muslim rage was just beginning to be apparent.      
 "Fundamentalism"&#8212;in connection with the Mohammedan world&#8212;was not a word
       often used by the newspapers in 1979; they hadn't yet worked through
to        that concept. What they spoke of more was "the revival of Islam."
And        that, indeed, to anyone contemplating it from a distance, was
a puzzle.        Islam, which had apparently had so little to offer its adherents
in the        last century and in the first half of this&#8212;what did it have
to offer to an        infinitely more educated, infinitely faster, world
in the later years of        the century?       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">The adaptation
of my own family and Trinidad Indian community to the        colonial Trinidad
and, through that, to the twentieth century hadn't been        easy. It had
been painful for us, an Asian people, living instinctive,        ritualized
lives, to awaken to an idea of our history and to learn to live        with
the idea of our political helplessness. There, had been very        difficult
social adjustments as well, For example: in our culture        marriages
had always been arranged; it took some time, and many damaged        lives,
for us to arrive at the other way. All of this went with the        personal
intellectual growth I have described.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">And I thought,
when I began to travel in the Muslim world, that I would        be travelling
among people who would be like the people of my own        community. A large
portion of Indians were Muslims; we had both had a        similar 19th century
imperial or colonial history. I thought that religion        was an accidental
difference. I thought, as people said, that faith was        faith; that
people living at a certain time in history would have felt the        same
urges.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">But it
wasn't like that The Muslims said that their religion was        fundamental
to them. And it was: it made for an immense difference. I have        to
stress that I was travelling in the non-Arab Muslim world. Islam began  
     as an Arab religion; it spread as an Arab empire. In Iran, Pakistan,
       Malaysia, Indonesia&#8212;the countries of my itinerary&#8212;I was travelling,
       therefore among people who had been converted to what was an alien
faith.        I was travelling among people who had had to make a double
adjustment&#8212;an        adjustment to the European empires of the 19th and 20th
century; and an        earlier adjustment to the Arab faith. You might almost
say that I was        among people who had been doubly colonized, doubly
removed from  themselves.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Because
I was soon to discover that no Colonization had been so        thorough as
the colonization that had come with the Arab faith. Colonized        or defeated
peoples can begin to distrust themselves. In the Muslim        countries
I am talking about, this distrust had all the force of religion.        It
was an article of the Arab faith that everything before the faith was   
    wrong, misguided, heretical; there was no room in the heart or mind of
       these believers for their pre-Mohammedan past. So ideas of history
here        were quite different from ideas of history elsewhere; there was
no wish        here to go back as far as possible into the past, and to learn
as much as        possible about the past.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Persia
had a great past; it had been the rival in classical times of        Greece
and Rome. But you wouldn't have believed it in Iran in 1979; for        the
Iranians the glory and the truth had begun with the coming of Islam,    
   Pakistan was a very new Muslim state. But the land was very old. In  
     Pakistan were the ruins of the very old cities of Mohenjo-Daro and  
     Harappa. Fabulous ruins, the discovery of which earlier this century
had        given a new idea of the history of the sub-continent. Not only
pre-Islamic        Ruins; but possibly also Pre-Hindu. There was an archaeological
       department, inherited from British days, which looked after the sites.
But        there was, especially with the growth of fundamentalism, a contrary
       current. This was expressed in a letter to a newspaper while I was
there.        The ruins of the cities, the writer said, should be hung with
quotations        from the Koran, saying that this was what befell unbelievers. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">The faith
abolished the past. And when the past was abolished like        this, more
than an idea of history suffered. Human behavior, and ideals of        good
behavior, could suffer. When I was in Pakistan, the newspapers were     
  running articles to mark the anniversary of the Arab conquest of Sind.
       This was the first part of the Indian sub-continent to be conquered
by the        Arabs. It occurred at the beginning of the eighth century.
The kingdom of        Sind&#8212;an enormous area: the southern half of Afghanistan,
the southern half        of Pakistan&#8212;at that time was a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom.
The brahmins didn't        really understand the outside world; the Buddhists
didn't believe in        taking life. It was a kingdom waiting to be conquered,
you might say. But        it took a long time for Sind to be conquered; it
was very far away from        the Arab heartland, across immense deserts.
Six or seven Arab expeditions        foundered.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">At one
time the third caliph himself, the third successor to the        Prophet,
called one of his lieutenants and said, "O Hakim, have you seen        Hindustan
and learnt all about it?" Hakim said, "Yes, O commander of the        faithful."
The caliph said, "Give us a description of it." and all Hakim's        frustration
and bitterness came out in his reply. "Its water is dark and        dirty,"
Hakim said. "Its fruit is bitter and poisonous. Its land is stony       
and its earth is salt. A small army will soon be annihilated, and large  
     one will soon die of hunger.&#8221;       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">This should
have been enough for the caliph. But, looking still for        some little
encouragement, he asked Hakim, "What about the people? Are        they faithful,
or do they break their word." Clearly, faithful people        would have
been easier to subdue, easier to lighten of their money. But        Hakim
almost spat out his reply. "The people are treacherous and        deceitful,"
Hakim said. And at that the caliph did take fright&#8212;the people        of Sind
sounded quite an enemy&#8212;and he ordered that the conquest of Sind        was
to be attempted no more.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">But Sind
was too tempting. The Arabs tried again and again. The        organization
and the drive and the attitudes of the Arabs, fortified by        their new
faith, in a world still tribal and disorganized, easy to        conquer,
the drive of the Arabs was remarkably like that of the Spaniards        in
the New World 800 years later&#8212;and this was not surprising, since the    
   Spaniards themselves had been conquered and ruled by the Arabs for some
       centuries. Spain, in fact, fell to the Arabs at about the same time
as        Sind did.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">The final
conquest of Sind was set on foot from Iraq, and was        superintended
from the town of Kufa by Hajjaj, the governor of Iraq. The        topicality
is fortuitous, I assure you. The aim of the Arab conquest of        Sind&#8212;and
this conquest had been thought about almost as soon as the faith        had
been established&#8212;the aim of the conquest had always been the acquiring  
     of slaves and plunder, rather than the spreading of the faith. And when
       finally Hajjaj, the governor of Iraq, received the head of the king
of        Sind, together with 60,000 slaves from Sind, and the royal one-fifth
of        the loot of Sind, that one-fifth decreed by the religious law,
he "placed        his forehead on the ground and offered prayers of thanksgiving,
by two        genuflections to God, and praised him, saying: 'Now have I
got all the        treasurers, whether open or buried, as well as other wealth,
and the        kingdom of the world."' There was a famous mosque in the town
of Kufa.        Hajjaj called the people there, and from the pulpit he told
them: "Good        news and good luck to the people of Syria and Arabia,
whom I congratulate        on the conquest of Sind and on the possession
of immense wealth ... which        the great and omnipotent God has kindly
bestowed on them."       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">I am quoting
from a translation of a 13th-century Persian text, the        Chachnama.
It is the main source for the story of the conquest of Sind. It        is
a surprisingly modern piece of writing, a good fast narrative, with     
  catching detail and dialogue. It tells a terrible story of plunder and
       killing&#8212;the Arab army was allowed to kill for days after the fall
of every        town in Sind; and then the plunder was assessed and distributed
to the        soldiers, after the fifth had been set aside for the caliph.
But to the        Persian writer, the story&#8212;written 500 years after the conquest
is only "a        pleasant tale of conquest." It is Arab or Muslim imperial
genre writing.        After 500 years&#8212;and though the Mongols are about to
break through&#8212;the        faith still holds; there is no new moral angle on
the destruction of the        kingdom of Sind.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">This was
the event that was being commemorated by articles in the        newspapers
when I was in Pakistan in 1979. There was an article by a        military
man about the successful Arab general. The article tried to be        fair,
in a military way, to the armies of both sides. It drew a rebuke        from
the chairman of tile National Commission of Historical and Cultural     
  Research.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">This was
what the chairman said:. "Employment of appropriate        phraseology is
necessary when one is projecting the image of a hero.        Expressions
such as 'invader' and 'defenders' and 'the Indian army'        fighting bravely
but not being quick enough to 'fall upon the withdrawing        enemy' loom
large in the article. It is further marred by some imbalanced        statements
such as follows: 'Had Raja Dahar defended the Indus heroically,        and
stopped Qasim from crossing it, the history of this sub-continent       
would have been quite different.' One fail to understand"&#8212;this is the   
    chairman of the Commission of Historical and Cultural Research&#8212;"whether
       the writer is applauding the defeat of the hero or lamenting the defeat
of        his rival." After 1200 years, the holy war is still being fought.
The hero        is the Arab invader, bringer of the faith. The rival whose
defeat is to be        applauded&#8212;and I was reading this in Sind&#8212;is the man
of Sind.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">To possess
the faith was to possess the only truth; and possession of        this truth
set many things on its head. To believe that the time before        the coming
of the faith was a time of error distorted more than an idea of        history.
What lay within the faith was to be judged in one way; what lay        outside
it was to be in another. The faith altered values, ideas of good        behavior,
human judgments.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">So I not
only began to understand what people in Pakistan meant when        they told
me that Islam was a complete way of life, affecting everything;        I
began to understand that&#8212;though it might be said that we had shared a   
    common subcontinental origin&#8212;I had travelled a different way. I began
to        formulate the idea of the universal civilization&#8212;which, growing
up in        Trinidad, I had lived in or been part of without quite knowing
that I did        so.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Starting
with that Hindu background of the instinctive, ritualized        life; growing
up in the unpromising conditions of colonial Trinidad; I        had&#8212;through
the process I have tried to describe earlier&#8212;gone through many        stages
of knowledge and self-knowledge. I had a better idea of Indian        history
and Indian art than my grandparents had. They possessed rituals,        epics,
myth; their identity lay within that light; beyond that light there     
  was darkness, which they wouldn't have been able to penetrate. I didn't
       possess the rituals and the myths; I saw them at a distance. But I
had in        exchange been granted the ideas of inquiry and the tools of
scholarship.        Identity for me was a more complicated matter. Many things
had gone to        make me. But there was no problem for me there. Whole
accumulations of        scholarship were mine, in the sense that I had access
to them. I could        carry four or five or six different cultural ideas
in my head. I knew        about my ancestry and of my ancestral culture;
I knew about the history        India and its political status; I knew where
I was born, and I knew the        history of the place; I had a sense of
the New World. I knew about the        literary forms I was interested in;
and I knew about the journey I would        have to make to the center in
order to exercise the vocation I had given        myself.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Now, travelling
among non-Arab Muslims, I found myself among a        colonized people who
had been stripped by their faith of all that        expanding intellectual
life, all the varied life of the mind and senses,        the expanding cultural
and historical knowledge of the world, that I had        been growing into
on the other side of the world. I was among people whose        identity
was more or less contained in the faith. I was among people who        wished
to be pure.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">In \4alavsla
they were desperate to rid themselves of their past,        desperate to
cleanse their people of tribal or animist practices, all the        subconscious
life, freighted with the past, that links people to the earth        on which
they walk, all the rich folk life that awakened people elsewhere        cultivate
and dredge for its poetry. They wishes, the more earnest of        these
Malay Muslims, to be nothing but their imported Arab faith; I got       
the impression that they would have liked, ideally, to make their minds  
     and souls a blank, an emptiness, so that they could be nothing but their
       faith. Such effort; such self-imposed tyranny. No colonization could
have        been greater than this colonization by the faith.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">While the
faith held, while it appeared to be unchallenged, the world        perhaps
held together. But when there appeared this powerful, encompassing      
 civilization from outside, men didn't know what to do. They could do only
       what they were capable of doing; they could only become more assiduous
in        the faith, more self-wounding, more ready to turn away from what
they        didn't feel they could master.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Muslim
fundamentalism in places like Malaysia and Indonesia seems new.        But
Europe has been in the East for a long time, and there has been Muslim  
     anxiety there for almost all of this time. This anxiety, this meeting
of        the two opposed worlds, the outgoing world of Europe and the closed
world        of the faith, was spotted a hundred years ago by the writer
Joseph Conrad,        who, with his remote Polish background, his wish as
a traveller to render        exactly what he saw, was able at a time of high
imperialism to go far        beyond the imperialistic, surface ways of writing
about the East and        native peoples.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">To Conrad
the world he travelled in was new; he looked hard at it.        There is
a quotation I would like to read from Conrad's second book,        publishes
in 1896, nearly 100 years ago, in which he catches something of        the
Muslim hysteria of that time&#8212;the hysteria which, a hundred years        later,
with greater education and wealth of the native peoples, and the        withdrawing
of empires, was to turn into the fundamentalism we hear about.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">"A half-naked,
betel-chewing pessimist stood upon the bank of the        tropical river,
on the edge of the still and immense forests; a man angry,        powerless,
empty-handed, with a cry of bitter discontent ready on his        lips; a
cry that, had it come out, would have run through the virgin        solitudes
of the woods as true, as great, as profound, as any        philosophical
shriek that ever came from the depths of an easy chair to        disturb
the impure wilderness of chimneys and roofs."       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Philosophical
hysteria&#8212;those were the words I wanted to give to you,        and I think
they still apply. They bring me back to the list of questions        and
issues that the senior fellow of the Institute, Myron Magnet, sent to   
    me when he was in England last summer. Why, he asked, are certain   
    societies or groups content to enjoy the fruits of progress, while  
     affecting to despise the conditions that promote that progress? What
       belief system do they oppose to it? And then, more specifically: why
is        Islam held up in opposition to western values? The answer, I believe,
is        that philosophical hysteria. It is not an easy thing to define
or        understand, and the Muslim spokesmen do not really help. They speak
       cliches, but that might only be because they perhaps have no way of
       expressing what they feel. And some have overriding political causes;
and        others are really religious missionaries rather than scholars. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">But years
ago, while the Shah still ruled, there appeared in the United        States
a small novel by a young Iranian woman that in its subdued,        unpolitical
way foreshadowed the hysteria that was to come. The novel was        called
Foreigner; the author was Nahid Rachlin. Perhaps it was as well        that
the novel appeared while the Shah ruled, and had t o avoid politics;    
   it is just possible that the delicate feeling of this novel might have
       been made trivial or ordinary if it had run into political protest. 
      </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
The central figure of the book is a young Iranian woman who        does research
work in Boston as a biologist. She is married to an        American, and
she might seem to be all right, well adapted. But when she        goes back
on a holiday to Tehran she loses her balance. She has some        trouble
with the bureaucracy. She can't get an exit visa; she begins to        feel
lost. She is disturbed by memories of her crowded, oppressive Iranian   
    childhood, with its prurient sexual intimations; disturbed by what remains
       of her old family life; disturbed by the overgrown, thuggish city,
full of        &#8220;western" buildings. And that is interesting, that use of
"western" rather        than big: it is as though the strangeness of the
outside world has come to        Tehran itself.       </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
Disturbed in this way, the young woman reflects on her time        in the
United States. It is not the time of clarity, as it might have once     
  appeared. She sees it now to be a time of emptiness. She can't say why
she        has lived the American life. Sexually and socially&#8212;in spite of
her        apparent success&#8212;she has never been in control; and she cannot
say,        either, why she has been doing the research work she has been
doing. All        this is very subtly and effectively done; we can see that
the young woman        was not prepared for the movement between civilizations,
the movement out        of the shut-in Iranian world, where the faith was
the complete way, filled        everything, left no spare corner of the mind
or will or soul, to the other        world where it was necessary to be an
individual and responsible; where        people developed vocations, and
were stirred by ambition and achievement,        and believed in perfectibility.
Once we understand or have an intimation        of that, we see, with the
central figure of the novel, what a torment and        emptiness that automatic,
imitative life in Boston has been for her.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Now, in
her distress, she falls ill. She goes to a hospital. The doctor        there
understands her unhappiness. He too has spent some time in the        United
States; when he came back, he said, he soothed himself by visiting      
 mosques and shrines for a month. He tells the young woman that her pain
       comes from an old ulcer. "What you have," he says, in his melancholy,
       seductive way, is a western disease." And the research biologist  
     eventually arrived at a decision. She will give up that Boston-imposed
       life of the intellect and meaningless work; she will turn back on
the        American emptiness; she will stay in Iran and put on the veil.
She will do        as the doctor did; she will visit shrines and mosques.
Having decided        that, she becomes happier than she has ever been. 
     </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Immensely
satisfying, that renunciation. But it is intellectually        flawed: it
assumes that there will continue to be people striving out        there,
in the stressed world, making drugs and medical equipment, to keep      
 the Iranian doctor's hospital going.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Again and
again, on my Islamic journey in 1979, 1 found a similar        unconscious
contradiction in people's attitudes. I remember especially a        newspaper
editor in Tehran. His paper had been at the heart of the        revolution.
In the middle of 1979 it was busy, in a state of glory. Seven        months
later, when I went back to Tehran, it had lost its heart; the once      
 busy main room was empty; all but two of the staff had disappeared. The
       American embassy had been seized; a financial crisis had followed;
many        foreign firms had closed down; advertising had dried up; the
newspaper        editor could hardly see his way ahead; every issue of the
paper lost        money; waiting for the crisis to end, the editor, it might
be said, had        become as much a hostage as the diplomats. He also, as
I now learned, had        two sons of university age. One was studying in
the United States; the        other had applied for a visa, but then the
hostage crisis had occurred.        This was news to me that the United States
should have been so important        to the sons of one of the spokesmen
of the Islamic revolution. I told the        editor I was surprised. He said,
speaking especially of the son waiting        for the visa, "It's his future." 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Emotional
satisfaction on one hand; thought for the future on the        other. The
editor was as divided as nearly everyone else. One, of Joseph        Conrad's
earliest stories of the East Indies, from the 1890s, was about a        local
raja or chieftain, a murderous man, a Muslim (though it is never        explicitly
said), who, in a crisis, having lost h1is Magical counsellor,        swims
out one night to one of the English merchant ships in the harbor to     
  ask the sailors, representatives of the immense power that had come from
       the other end of the world, for an amulet, a magical charm. The sailors
       are at a loss; but then someone among them gives the raja a British
coin,        a sixpence commemorating Queen Victoria's jubilee; and the raja
is well        pleased. Conrad didn't treat the story as a joke; lie loaded
it with        philosophical implications for both sides, and I feel now
that he saw        truly.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">In the
100 years since that story, the wealth of the world has grown,        power
has grown, education has spread; the disturbance, the philosophical     
  shriek, has been amplified. The division in the revolutionary editor's
       spirit, and the renunciation of the fictional biologist, both contain
a        tribute unacknowledged, but all the more profound to the universal
       civilization. Simple charms alone cannot be acquired from it; other,
       difficult things come with it as well: ambition, endeavor, individuality.

      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
The universal civilization has been a long time in the        making. It
wasn't always universal; it wasn't always as attractive as it        is today.
The expansion of Europe gave it for at least three centuries a        racial
taint, which still causes pain. In Trinidad I grew up in the last       
days of that kind of racialism. And that, perhaps, has given me a greater
       appreciation of the immense changes that have taken place since the
end of        the war, the extraordinary attempt of this civilization to
accommodate the        rest of the world, and all the currents of that world's
thought.       </font></p>
      <p align="Left"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">
I come back now to the first questions Myron Magnet put to        me earlier
this year. Are we only as strong as our beliefs? Is it        sufficiently
merely to hold a worldview, an ethical view, intensely? You        will understand
the anxieties behind the questions. "The questions, of        course, for
all their apparent pessimism, are loaded; they contain their        own answers.
But they are also genuinely double-aged. For that reason they        can
also be seen as a reaching out to a far-off and sometimes hostile       
system of fixed belief; they can be seen as an aspect of the universality
       of our civilization at this period. Philosophical diffidence meets
       philosophical hysteria; and the diffident man is, at the end, the
more in        control.       </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">Because
my movement within this civilization has been from the        periphery to
the center, I may have seen or felt certain things more        freshly than
people to whom those things were everyday. One such thing was        my discovery,
as a child, a child worried about pain and cruelty, my        discovery of
the Christian precept, Do unto others as you would have        others do
unto you. There was no such human consolation in the Hinduism I        grew
up with, and though I have never had any religious faith&#8212;the simple     
  idea was, and is, dazzling to me, perfect as a guide to human behavior. 
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT" size="-1">A later
realization&#8212;I suppose I have sensed it most of my life, but I        have
understood it philosophically only during the preparation of this       
talk&#8212;has been the beauty of the idea of the pursuit of happiness. Familiar
       words, easy to take for granted; easy to misconstrue. This idea of
the        pursuit of happiness is at the heart of the attractiveness of
the        civilization to so many outside it or on its periphery. I find
it        marvelous to contemplate to what an extent, after two centuries,
and after        the terrible history of the earlier part of this century,
the idea has        come to a kind of fruition. It is an elastic idea; it
fits all men. It        implies a certain kind of society, a certain kind
of awakened spirit. I        don't imagine my father's parents would have
been able to understand the        idea. So much is contained in it: the
idea of the individual,        responsibility, choice, the life of the intellect,
the idea of vocation        and perfectibility and achievement. It is an
immense human idea. It cannot        be reduced to a fixed system. It cannot
generate fanaticism. But it is        known to exist; and because of that,
other more rigid systems in the end        blow away.       </font></p>
