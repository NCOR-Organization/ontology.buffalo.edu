      the "war against terrorism" already? You'll need to get used to it because 
      it could last years or decades. Not because that's the time it will take 
      to completely eradicate terrorism, as some politicians and pundits have 
      asserted, but rather because we're losing this war a little bit more 
      everyday and because it risks becoming a permanent war, just like the 
      so-called "war on drugs". Like that one, it will be a purely statist 
      invention which will provide for the maintenance of a whole bureaucratic 
      and police apparatus of repression whose main purpose will be to protect 
      its turf and advance its own interest while guzzling taxpayers 
      money.</FONT></FONT></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER><FONT

      seen these police inspectors explaining that they "dismantled another 
      important network of contraband, thus dealing a hard blow to drug 
      trafficking", while proudly displaying for the cameras their latest 
      harvest of plastic bags filled with cocaine and machine guns and 
      revolvers. Of course, the chief inspector invariably informs us, if the 
      police had a bigger budget and greater powers, they could fight more 
      effectively and catch all the other smugglers and we would get rid of this 
      social problem once and for all.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR><FONT

      size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practically 
      everybody gulps down these stupidities without disputing them, beginning 
      with our complacent media. In fact, in the fight against drugs the state 
      is only winning a few battles, never the war itself. This is impossible as 
      long as there is a demand for drugs. On the contrary, the war on drugs is 
      only making this business more profitable and appealing for one cohort 
      after another of potential criminals by causing the price of drugs to 
      rise. The war on drugs is a closed system disconnected from reality, which 
      goes on shielded from any rational argument that could question it, 
      because an extensive clique of parasites (politicians, bureaucrats and 
      policemen) find it in their interest to pursue it, and also because "we've 
      got to do something to protect our children". Instead of facing reality 
      and attacking the problem at its roots to try to manage it more 
      effectively, we charge ahead with repressive methods. And the headlines 
      remain the same, year after year, decade after 
      decade.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT

      is coming one only has to read and listen to the irrational arguments of 
      those who, since September 11th, have been sermonizing us on the need to 
      "do something" and "to take a clear stand for or against Evil" &ndash; meaning 
      for or against a military solution. They assure us that bombing 
      Afghanistan as the American army has been doing for three weeks now is a 
      step in the right direction. Then we'll only need to catch bin Laden and 
      his accomplices, maybe pursue a couple more terrorists in some mop-up 
      operations in the other Muslim countries where they hide, and that will be 
      it.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT

      information or analysis which could contradict this scenario is struck out 
      of their neural pathways, or declared immoral and odious because "to 
      discuss what could have motivated the terrorists is akin to finding 
      justifications for the 9-11 massacre". Just like the hotheads of the war 
      on drugs close their eyes on some unavoidable facts that should lead them 
      to reconsider its effectiveness, the hysterical supporters of the war<B> 
      </B>against terrorism don't even want to understand why so many fanatics 
      are willing to die in suicide attacks against Westerners and why their 
      cause, if not their means, enjoys such a wide support within the Arabic 
      and Moslem populations. There's nothing to understand, they say. And 
      what's more, to dispute the morality or the efficiency of bombardments is 
      to give evidence of a lack of patriotism. In any case, did the spokesman 
      of the State Department not declare just yesterday that the military 
      operations in Afghanistan had been a complete success so 
      far?</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

      that goes by, Afghan civilians are being killed in this stupid war. For 
      the past three weeks, the American army has worked unceasingly to destroy 
      any infrastructure that remains in this ravaged country, although one 
      would be forgiven for not seeing the link between the fight against 
      terrorism and the destruction of an airport in Kandahar or that of a 
      bridge and a road in the suburb of Kabul. The country has been suffering 
      from a drought for some years, and this follows two decades of war against 
      the Russians and civil war. Hundreds of refugees are being added every day 
      to the 3,5 millions that have already fled the country. This destruction 
      is only worsening an already critical situation. This winter, they will be 
      dying of famine and disease by the thousands in the refugee

      clever moralists, whose eyes are full of sand anyway, have no reproach to 
      make here. Their selective indignation is awakened by the gripping images

      Palestinians by Israel, supported by a 3-billion dollar yearly 
      contribution of the United States. They see that the Gulf War still 
      continues after ten years, with weekly bombardments and an embargo which 
      affects only the population and not the regime, a war which has already 
      caused hundreds of thousand of deaths in Iraq. And they see that the U.S. 
      continues to support corrupt regimes which violate their rights and keep 
      them in poverty, all this for "strategic" 
      considerations.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR><FONT

      which the massacre of American civilians becomes an absolute crime the

      West is not at all a preordained reality. On the contrary it is fed by our 
      actions, more specifically by the U.S. foreign policy. Not only is nothing 
      being done to eliminate the causes of this resentment ("We shouldn't show 
      any sign of weakness by responding to the terrorists' demands!", warn the 
      warmongers), we're doing everything now to fan the flames by killing 
      innocent civilians who have nothing to do with bin Laden. Let me repeat 
      the libertarian creed here, for all those who don't know or remember it, 
      including many who call themselves libertarians: collective responsibility 
      is a monstrous collectivist notion and killing innocent civilians in the

      also, every murder of a "Palestinian terrorist leader" and every measure 
      of reprisals by the Israeli army in the occupied territories provokes a 
      revolt and more slaughters, with the sole effect of encouraging other 
      young Palestinians to join the guerrilla warfare. Meanwhile, instead of 
      trying to implement a permanent solution to the problem, the Israeli 
      government continues to colonize the West Bank and Gaza Strip (about 
      200,000 Jewish settlers already live there) and to proceed with the ethnic 
      cleansing of the Palestinian population. Israel has in consequence become 
      a police state where insecurity is a part of everyday 
      life.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR><FONT

      place that lead millions of Arabs and Moslems to see us as their 
      oppressors and enemies. And in a few years, if this pessimistic scenario 
      comes true, we shall doubtless regularly see on our TV screens generals 
      announcing that the army "has destroyed another important terrorist cell, 
      thus dealing a hard blow to the enemies of our free and democratic 
      society". That is, of what will remain of our freedom and our 
      democracy.</FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
