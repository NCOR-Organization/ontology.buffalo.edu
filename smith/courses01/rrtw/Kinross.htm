      align=left> o millions of men and women the war has been as a book of 
      Revelation. What did so many of us, coming out of the West, know about our 
      dusky brethren of the East? Less than nothing; for were we not cursed with 
      that 'little knowledge' which is far more dangerous than a perfect 
      ignorance? We had, perhaps, read Burton, and even Burckhardt, and 
      Marmaduke Pickthall, and Kipling. Pickthall, by the way, is easily first, 
      where it comes to English-written fiction dealing with Mohammedans. Then 
      there is Doughty, whose <I>Wanderings</I>, however, are confined to 
      Arabia. I, like so many others, had read all these, and I dare say more to 
      the same effect: Moltlke's <I>Reisebriefe</I>, for instance, Loti, 
      Vamb&eacute;ry, Russian and Polish stories of the Turk and Tartar. One was 
      chock-full of this shadow-show, which revealed so little; which awaited 
      the fertilizing stroke of actual contact and a practical experience. Well, 
      I have had four years of it, and six months of leisure for digestive 
      purposes. Now Islam, to me, is a living thing, instead of a mystery 
      concocted of forlorn warfare, domes and minarets, veiled women, and sacks 
      of gold, and prayers, ablutions, and prostrations.<BR><BR>I would like the 
      reader at this juncture to attempt a serious definition of Christianity 
      and its exemplars. At only one point, so far as I can discover, is the 
      normal Christian in complete accord with other Christians. He attempts to 
      practise monogamy. He does not always succeed in this attempt; in fact, 
      his failures are a constant source of mirth and comfort to the Unbeliever. 
      But monogamy and all that it implies in the way of home and children is 
      his ideal, and more often than not he achieves it. In most other respects 
      the Christians of this world achieve variety. In the Levant, for instance, 
      the typical Christian is an accomplished liar, an abject coward, and a 
      noxious parasite, pimp, and pander. One may explain and, perhaps, pardon 
      these aberrations, and even admit that there are numerous exceptions to a 
      general rule. In Great Britain, I am thankful to say, the Christian is, 
      generally speaking, a brave and honest man, who respects women and 
      children and whose ruling passion is a desire for fair play. The North 
      American Christian, I believe, is not dissimilar. In France the Christian 
      displays a more sanguine and, at the same time, a less reflective 
      temperament; in Prussia he becomes a braggart or a servile knave; in 
      Russia he is rather a simpleton; in Serbia he is a lion for courage and 
      endurance; in Australia his exterior is rough and his heart is that of a 
      little child.<BR><BR>One might go on for a week, enumerating the varied 
      species that inhabit this particular field of natural history; but in the 
      main one must agree with Buckle and that noble torso which enriches and 
      adorns our vast heritage of British thought.<BR><BR>As with the Christian, 
      so with our Moslem brother. Climate, environment, and heredity have 
      conspired to make him a person of infinite variety. Courageous, simple, 
      and brave in a state of innocence,&mdash;I allude, say, to the Turkish peasant 
      or the <I>fellaheen</I> of the Sudan,&mdash;in Egypt he becomes a coward and a 
      prevaricator; in Palestine and Syria a weakling; in the Desert a sportsman 
      and a gentleman; in Afghanistan a bloody-minded fanatic; in Northern India 
      a soldier or a peaceful cultivator; in the Malayan islands a secretive and 
      remote survival. And as the Christians of the world are united by a common 
      impulse toward monogamy and the family, so the Moslems of the world 
      achieve at one point a unity by subjecting their women to polygamy and a 
      system wherein the tribe or clan replaces our smaller and more intimate 
      unit. The Moslem civilization is, beyond all other things, masculine; the 
      Christian civilization is of both sexes and has in the main, I believe, 
      been preserved and guarded by its women.<BR><BR>Islam, I sometimes think, 
      is being destroyed by its men. The downfall of the Turkish Empire may 
      certainly be ascribed to such an exclusively masculine and emasculated 
      domination.<BR><BR>Life, and even religious life, is a perpetual warfare. 
      We may disguise this fact and cover it up with catchwords, as Progress and 
      Reform, Evolution and Revolution. But warfare it remains. Islam was all 
      these things. It was a better faith than the 'Christianity' which it 
      supplanted in the East, a 'Christianity' chiefly notable for feud, 
      faction, greed, persecution, sectarianism; for anything and everything but 
      the application of the Christian doctrine. It was a better faith than the 
      image-worship which it destroyed and supplanted. It even made the 
      attempt&mdash;vitiated by its own puerilities and inherent animalism&mdash;to combine 
      in one faith the beauties and the truths revealed by Moses and by Christ. 
      If the world had stood still, moving neither forward nor backward from, 
      say, 1000 A.D., and had remained so standing forever, Islam would have 
      been as good a religion as any other. But the world has not stood still. 
      The Christian faith, energized by its dynamics and the temperate climates 
      wherein it found expansion and gathered forces at once magnificent and 
      irresistible, has moved the world; has transformed it beyond any vision or 
      dream permitted to the Prophet of the Arabian God.<BR><BR>Had Islam 
      conquered the world, there would have been no printing press, no 
      Renaissance, and no Americas. The Western Hemisphere would still be 
      undiscovered. It is an almost incredible supposition, but, envisage it as 
      one may, it is indisputable. All the mechanical and adventurous aspects of 
      the human Saga are primarily of Greece and Rome and the Christian heirs of 
      these two civilizations. Arabian culture died an early death, sterilized 
      by too great a reverence for the letter of the Koran and the savage 
      irruptions of those Central Asiatic hordes whom, to-day, we call the Turk. 
      Never a very vigorous plant, the culture of the Arabic theologians, 
      mathematicians, astronomers, architects, historians, craftsmen, poets, had 
      run its appointed course, and had, moreover, received the wound from which 
      it has only recently, thanks to Allenby, Lawrence, and Feisal, made some 
      sort of a recovery. The Turk took charge of the religion of his victim, 
      and with more or less success imposed his will upon Islam. And, 
      incidentally, he also enslaved such Christian communities as came under 
      his hand&mdash;Greeks, Armenians, Copts, and Syrians, to name the but most 
      familiar, and to omit those liberated by Pole and Russian, Austrian and 
      Spaniard, Venetian, French and British, in the more recent

      align=left> y own first contact with Islam occurred in Macedonia. The Turk 
      had ruled here and had made a wilderness. At every step one took, one 
      thanked the Lord that he had been kicked out. The Greek could not be worse 
      and might be better. All that remained now of Islam was cemetery after 
      cemetery falling to ruin, falling back into the wildness and the savagery 
      of those deserted moors. There had been forests here; the Turk had 
      destroyed them. There had been aqueducts and water and good roads; the 
      Turk had let them fall to ruin. His business was war; in the pursuits of 
      peace he had proved contemptible. He could neither govern nor administer, 
      nor organize, nor do anything but suck the blood of this fair province. 
      Greek, Jew, and Bulgar did their best under his exactions, till at last 
      Greek and Bulgar, grown tired of fighting with one another, turned on the 
      common enemy and kicked him out. A furtive remnant lingers on in the city 
      of Salonica, but it is moribund and powerless. You and me it despises, as 
      it has been taught to do in its mosques and in its schools; but it is 
      extremely glad to take our money. We are still unclean and we are still 
      the Infidel; but at the same time we are the Conquerors, and must 
      therefore be obeyed, until Allah, in his own good time, decrees our 
      overthrow. Doubtless he has some good reason for our present elevation, 
      temporary and disgusting though it be.<BR><BR>Thus, more or less, argue 
      the learned Mussulmans of Macedonia. The unlearned and the simple, 
      however, are not so severe. I am quite unrepentant where, perhaps, I ought 
      to be ashamed. To me, as to most other Englishmen, the unlearned Turk is 
      infinitely preferable to the Levantine, be he Jew or Gentile, Zionist or 
      Greek. I put the Cretan in the place of honor; the Cretan Christian is the 
      finest thing in the near East. But after him I would place the Christians 
      of places like Bethlehem and Ramallah, and, after these, the unlearned 
      Turk.<BR><BR>Though I spent two years in Macedonia, never a Greek or Jew 
      came near me but to sell me, at three times its value, something I did not 
      want; or he might have been a pimp, or a vendor of damnable liquor, 
      adulterated from dregs to label. There are numerous exceptions to this 
      general rule&mdash;of that I have no doubt; but such was my own experience, and 
      that of practically every Frenchman, Canadian, Serb, or British private 
      and officer of the Salonica army.<BR><BR>The Moslem, however, won often 
      our respect and even our affection. For the educated of that faith I had 
      little use. Those I met, and they were fairly representative, were mainly 
      political refugees and assassins who had fallen out with Enver and the 
      Committee of Union and Progress. Ridiculous title of a more than 
      ridiculous society! And yet for several years this group of adventurers, 
      murderers, and dupes won the support and confidence of all 'liberals' and 
      'humanitarians' of enlightened West!<BR><BR>O&mdash;&mdash; Bey was quite a good 
      sample of the educated Turk. He had been in diplomatic service, but had 
      lost his job through a characteristic and typical misfortune. Appointed to 
      a position of some consequence in a Protestant country, he had failed to 
      respect the sexual prejudices of the Infidel. In Sodom or Gomorrah, or 
      even in Cairo or Teheran, he might have served his country with 
      distinction; but in the less imaginative North he was <I>de trop</I>. I 
      used to talk politics and play chess with him.<BR><BR>The bey's politics 
      amounted to this: why did British diplomacy allow German diplomacy to lead 
      poor Turkey by the nose? He presupposed, firstly, that the Turk could do 
      no wrong, and, secondly, that the Turk was an irresponible and charming 
      child whom it was duty of the Great Powers to pet and spoil. To my 
      unregenerate mind, a good hiding would have been more salutary. As a 
      chess-player, the bey was equally unconvincing. He would begin well, and 
      then lose patience and make an ass of himself. At first I thought these 
      wild moves had some deep and hidden significance; but after a game or two 
      it was plain that my friend had lost his self-control and was heading 
      straight away for ruin.<BR><BR>The same psychology applied to politics 
      will explain a deal that puzzles us about the conduct of the Turk, be it 
      the massacre of Armenians or his pathetic attempts at government, 
      beginning with himself. O&mdash;&mdash; Bey died suddenly. My own impression is that 
      he was poisoned; for of such is the kingdom of politics in the Near 
      East.<BR><BR>Our illiterate and untraveled Turkish friends were of quite a 
      different stamp. Every time I came into Salonica from the wilderness, 
      Achmet the barber would welcome me as if he were the hound of Ulysses. He 
      did not care a button for my money; he would have paid me to enter his 
      shop; he would have fed me and sheltered me and found me a bride. I am not 
      deluding myself; I am stating a fact. And in the Turkish villages 
      up-country were men of the same stamp&mdash;simple, loyal, industrious, and 
      clean. I lay peculiar stress upon their cleanliness. The Greek Christians, 
      who likewise had their villages, were the reverse of clean. My friend 
      Adossides, who governed this country under direction of <I>his</I> friend, 
      Venizelos, was wise enough to see that the Turkish peasant was, more or 
      less, its greatest asset.<BR><BR>These simple men, enjoying for the first 
      time in their lives a stable and honest administration, and free from 
      incubus of perpetual and futile wars, were citizens of whom any country 
      might be proud. The more I saw of them, the more I admired them. They had 
      dignity and a perfect courtesy, added to these were honesty, truthfulness, 
      sobriety, and an interest in their work which made them independent of the 
      merchants and middle-men. They made one understand those travelers who 
      report that the Turk is the only gentleman in the Near East.<BR><BR>Once 
      only&mdash;and that by accident&mdash;did I have the opportunity of holding converse 
      with a maiden of this simpler class. It is rather a ridiculous story, as 
      any story of the kind must be in the East, where a man is permitted to see 
      the faces of only his wife or wives and such near relatives as the law 
      allows.<BR><BR>One summer afternoon I came to a walled garden, the door of 
      which stood wide open. In the centre was a flagged space, with a stone 
      well and a tree bearing some strange fruit. I have grown many kinds of 
      fruit, but this kind I could not recognize; so in I stepped to 
      investigate. A young girl, unveiled and dressed in black, came up and 
      joined me. She must have been about sixteen, and she was quite the most 
      charming thing I had seen for months. I asked her about the tree that had 
      so puzzled me. It was a pomegranate, heavy with fruit, and the first I had 
      ever seen. The girl spoke French,&mdash;France has long supported a very noble 
      series of schools in the Near East,&mdash;and soon we were the best of friends. 
      We sat in the stone circle that ringed the well, and talked away for quite 
      a while. It was just like talking to a very bright and questioning 
      school-girl at home; and so we sat, chatting and laughing together, till 
      an old woman&mdash;I suppose she was old&mdash;came out to us, all veils and fury, and 
      chased my little friend indoors. What happened to her afterward I was 
      never able to discover; but I can assure the reader that she was no young 
      woman out of a Pierre Loti novel, but just a happy, healthy kid such as 
      you may find by the dozen in Europe, and, for all I know, in America as 
      well.<BR><BR>Such were the first Moslem ladies I had the luck to 
      encounter: the duenna, obviously of the orthodox old school; the young 
      one, less concerned with the properties, and trustful as a terrier pup 
      that has never met unkindness. In a higher class&mdash;the class of my defunct 
      companion, O&mdash;&mdash; Bey&mdash;I encountered absurd young women who raved about Enver. 
      These were hopeless. Neither European nor Moslem, they seemed purely a 
      destructive species; and it is to be hoped that by now they are safely 
      under lock and key and thrice guarded by officers of the harem.<BR><BR>The 
      next time I met the Turk, it was in Palestine, and he an open enemy and 
      very much mixed up and muddled with his friend the Hun. Almost one felt 
      sorry for the Hun. And one felt quite sorry for the common Turkish 
      soldier. The common Turkish soldier had been lied to more than any of us. 
      In war and peace the Moslem has one sure advantage over the Christian. He 
      can always raise the devils of religious fanaticism and hate, which we of 
      the West have long since outgrown. As a Turk said to me one day, over a 
      meal we shared in Jerusalem, 'You Protestants seem to have no religion.' 
      In his sense of the word, we have none; for we had neither murdered nor 
      enslaved our beaten foe, nor had we dishonored his women. Nor had Allenby, 
      like his Turkish opposite, Djemal, established a harem of two hundred 
      selected ladies of the country; nor had he robbed his soldiers of their 
      pay, sold their rations and equipment, and let them starve and go 
      naked.<BR><BR>Saladin, by the way, was a finer gentleman than any of his 
      Crusading opposites. By so much has Islam degenerated and Christianity 
      ascended since the twelfth century; though the great majority of our 
      politicians, so I am told, can still give points and a beating to any 
      knight or bishop who wore the Cross.<BR><BR>Another Moslem country with 
      which I am familiar is Egypt, truly the most mirth-provoking land on this 
      planet. Macedonia is sinister and tragic; Syria and Palestine and Sinai 
      and Libya are charged with drama and the tears of things; but modern Egypt 
      is pure classic comedy from end to end. As my friend Judge X&mdash;&mdash; once said 
      to me, and he had known the place with a judicial thoroughness for twenty 
      years, 'Everybody out here is a bit <I>magnoon</I>.' Magnoon means 
      'touched,' or agreeably insane. Hamlet, for instance, was magnoon; and so, 
      I fancy, are many of the home-keeping Irish. The tedium engendered by 
      great heats and a monotony of sunlight may account for this perversity. 
      Whenever I think of Egypt and the Egyptian, I have to laugh. Otherwise, 
      one might weep over him. England has given him two great men, Cromer and 
      Kitchener. The rest have been nonentities, though Allenby may prove to be 
      a third.<BR><BR>It is interesting to talk with an Egyptian about Cromer 
      and Kitchener. The first he respects, the second he loves. Cromer was a 
      great English gentleman, without much Arabic, immersed in difficult 
      affairs, and something of a scholar and a recluse, as any study of his 
      writings will more than testify. Kitchener was more Egyptian than the 
      Egyptians, a rare speaker of their tongue, a man who had read other men 
      more than books; and he was power&mdash;which means devoted service&mdash;incarnate. 
      Ardent Nationalists have spoken to me about Kitchener as Verlaine speaks 
      of that imaginary mistress who 'm'aime et me comprend,' and whose 'regard 
      est pareil au regard des statues.' When there was riot and murder in Egypt 
      during the first half of 1919, similar Nationalists repeated, 'If only 
      Kitchener had lived!' And they meant it, too! The Oriental adores a master 
      who says, 'Yes,' or who says 'No'; and Kitchener not only was such a 
      master, but he had the means and strength to enforce his decisions. With 
      that, he ever treated the Egyptian as a man and a brother. In his heart, 
      no doubt, he preferred the brave and devoted Sudanese, unspoiled by the 
      contact with the West, who had fought his battles, and whose battles he 
      too had fought; but he never showed this preference, and to all men and 
      women, and especially to the poor, the learned, and the unfortunate, he 
      was alike. Allenby has this same perfection of courtesy combined with 
      firmness, a similar prestige and aura of great deeds and and famous 
      victories; but as yet he lacks his precursor's intimacy with the people 
      and their language, and years of makeshift government have made his task 
      no easier.<BR><BR>

      align=left> n dealing with the East, it is necessary to have the patience 
      of fifty camels, and, furthermore, one must avoid being too censorious. 
      One's own standards of truth, honesty, self-control, and especially of 
      sexual morality, need not be laid aside; but one must accept the fact that 
      the East views most of these matters in a totally different light. The 
      East lives by its senses, the West attempts to follow its ideals; in the 
      one world, matter is more dominant than spirit; in the other, climate, 
      religion, light, and sanitation have reversed this position. Nor were we 
      always the chastened heroes of to-day. Read, for instance, the story of 
      the Oddi and the Baglioni of Perugia, as recovered by John Addington 
      Symonds; read the Restoration dramatists or the minor Elizabethan 
      playwrights; or Rabelais or Boccaccio; or the filth that was written and 
      printed in Paris before the war, and read throughout Europe and America. 
      We are very far from being immaculate, and it is only of recent years, as 
      history goes, that the Highland clansman has ceased to murder and rob his 
      neighbor, the French serf to lie and accept forced labor, the Virginian to 
      own slaves, and the English Catholic or Protestant to burn his fellow 
      Christian at the stake. I really dare not say that Islam is much worse 
      than we have been; and, more than anybody, it is we who have set its 
      present face toward revolt.<BR><BR>I am told that, if President Wilson's 
      views upon self-determination were applied to the state of Florida or 
      Mississippi, where the negro population exceeds the white by many 
      thousands, there could be but one outcome to such an application, which I 
      sincerely hope and trust will never be permitted. In some such light one 
      is forced to view what is called the Egyptian Question, where a 
      numerically inferior Christian population is asked to accept the rule of 
      an Islamic or pseudo-Islamic majority, calling itself for political 
      purposes the Egyptian Nation, but in reality being neither a nation nor 
      markedly Egyptian.<BR><BR>In the light of historic truth, as well as in 
      the light of factual experience, one has to admit that Egyptian 
      nationality ceased to exist a good many years before the birth of Christ; 
      that it has never recovered from this overthrow; and that there is neither 
      Egyptian language, literature, nor art. Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, and 
      Turk have held Egypt by the sword; Mameluke and Frenchman and Albanian 
      have been its master; and to-day, failing the support of France and Italy, 
      to whom a joint guardianship was offered, the British are in charge. No 
      native-born Egyptian has governed in the Nile valley for well over two 
      thousand years.<BR><BR>Nor is there any race of people in that country 
      which may be regarded in the way one regards the Frenchman of France, the 
      Englishman of England or, say, the Dane of Denmark. A native of Egypt may 
      be anything, from a woolly-haired negro to an ivory-colored landowner or 
      government official. The practice of polygamy has made a hotch-potch of 
      the race and destroyed its identity. Patriotism, in the Western sense of 
      that much-abused word, democracy, and those liberal institutions which are 
      at once the glory and the stigmata of the Christian world, do not exist in 
      Egypt or in any other Moslem province. The East is well content to do 
      without them.<BR><BR>My soldier-servant, Ibrahim, put the whole political 
      situation in a nutshell, when, before we were separated by order of the 
      higher authorities, he asked me to get him a new job.<BR><BR>'Why don't 
      you go to one of your own people?' I replied. 'I am only an Unbeliever and 
      an Englishman.'<BR><BR>We were excellent friends and understood one 
      another perfectly, and so I could permit myself these candors.<BR><BR>'If 
      I go to an Egyptian, he say, "Bring me money, or bring me a girl, and then 
      I find you a job." If you send me to an Englishman, he say, "What can you 
      do?" and he give me so much pay.' Thus Ibrahim.<BR><BR>'Where would you 
      find a girl?' I asked next.<BR><BR>Ibrahim shrugged his shoulders and 
      said, 'My sister.'<BR><BR>The Egyptian Nationalist politician, invariably 
      a lawyer, journalist, priest, or some other windy individual, wishes to 
      get hold of Ibrahim's money and Ibrahim's little sister. In Europe and 
      America, gullible Intellectuals and Labor people, of both sexes or none at 
      all, applaud and sympathize with the noble periods and mendacities which 
      come as easy to the Oriental as tumbling off a log. What, however, he is 
      really after is Ibrahim's money and Ibrahim's little sister.<BR><BR>

      align=left> he white man is in Egypt, India, and elsewhere, primarily to 
      protect Ibrahim's money and Ibrahim's little sister.<BR><BR>We of the West 
      have managed to set some bounds to the rascality of our priests and 
      politicians; we have created a Public Opinion which they fear as the Devil 
      fears the Cross. In the Moslem world it is different, just as in our own 
      world it was different before the Reformation and the major 
      revolutions.<BR><BR>Fundamentally, there is not much difference between 
      the Islam and the Christian world of the Middle Ages. The trouble with 
      Islam is that it is tied fast by the Koran and the intense individualism 
      of the normal Mohammedan. In the modern world man must cooperate or go 
      under. A religion that ignores the personal existence of an entire sex; 
      that forbids the lending of money, and therefore places its followers 
      outside that whole system of loans and credit upon which, for good or for 
      evil, our modern civilization is based; a religion that is so full of 
      exclusions as to make the murder or robbery of an Unbeliever a matter of 
      little or no account, can hardly hope to survive outside the dark places 
      of the earth. In its own way it is honest, and in that it is pathetic; but 
      the world needs the cotton of the Egyptian, the barley of Palestine, the 
      silks and spices, the oils and minerals, the fruits and tobacco, and all 
      the other produce and raw material that God has placed in the countries 
      which are at present occupied by the followers of the Prophet. And it 
      seems to me that if the Mohammedan cannot irrigate and sow and dig and 
      cultivate and mine and bore, under the direction of men of his own faith, 
      then he will have to accept the direction and, with that, the political 
      ascendancy of the despised Christian.<BR><BR>The French and Dutch, in 
      their colonial administration, have accepted this point of view quite 
      frankly and with a quite admirable logic. They are firm, but tolerant. 
      They do not trouble to force their own national ideals on this unready 
      soil, and they are spared, in Tunis and Algeria, in Java and Sumatra, all 
      those ridiculous events and manifestations which must occur when an 
      Oriental people is led, <I>nolens volens</I>, into a blind alley. The 
      Anglo-Saxon, inevitably perhaps, has preached Milton and Mill, and at the 
      same time denied an immediate practical application of their theories. In 
      this, Great Britain and America are much alike. Liberty, Equality, and 
      Fraternity, however, though fine words to write upon a banner, are the 
      most misleading of symbols. Man has to be ready for these ultimate gifts 
      before he is fit to be intrusted with their dangers and felicities. The 
      Christian world has only in spots arrived at such a consummation; the 
      Moslem world is quite unready.<BR><BR>During the four years that I lived 
      among Mohammedans I never fell in with an original thinker or a mind that 
      could be regarded as in any way important. And, indeed, Islam has 
      contributed little or nothing to the sum of human knowledge. An English 
      friend of mine, a well-known educationalist, once said to me, "I have 
      given ten years to the study of Arabic; I read it and write it; but there 
      is next to nothing to read, and there is no audience to which an original 
      writer can appeal.'<BR><BR>This is perfectly true, as I discovered for 
      myself when I looked for an Arabic version of Cromer's <I>Modern 
      Egypt</I>. There is no such version. Let us assume that Cromwell or George 
      Washington or Abraham Lincoln had been able to write a great book, giving 
      a clear and convincing account of the events which he moulded, of the 
      faith which upheld him, and of the people he led out of the wilderness. 
      Such a book is Cromer's <I>Modern Egypt</I>; and yet so incurious and so 
      illiterate is the Moslem world, that, for all it cares, this masterpiece 
      might have remained unwritten.<BR><BR>Islam is a faith of inhibitions. It 
      says, 'You must not,' a hundred times for every once that it says, 'You 
      must.' A people cannot live by negation and denial. The West affirms, and 
      in so doing saves itself. Every Mohammedan I have met who could stand up 
      to and hold his own with the English or the French was a Mohammedan only 
      by courtesy. S&mdash;&mdash; Pacha, for instance, had but a single wife, and was 
      rather henpecked; he drank good wine and enjoyed it; and in religion he 
      was agnostic, with a sentimental attachment to Islam. His social outlook 
      was that of a feudal baron; he was hospitable and generous to a degree 
      scarce known outside the East; and with that he was fat, self-indulgent, 
      and the reverse of war-like. There are dozens like him in the East&mdash;capable 
      men in their own way, honest, industrious, afraid of the major 
      responsibilities, lacking in initiative, and full of a conversation which 
      is pleasantly superficial, and, in its larger moments, inclined to 
      platitude.<BR><BR>The Indian Moslem, being farther from Mecca and with a 
      good many years of decent government behind him, rather resembles those 
      Catholics who live a good many miles from Rome. My own information about 
      Mecca, by the way, is mainly derived from Hurgronje, a Dutch Orientalist, 
      who had the unique experience of a six-months' residence in the Holy City, 
      and of whose work there is no English translation. Some enterprising 
      publisher should remedy this omission. The Indian Moslem&mdash;some not very 
      convincing specimens are at present touring the world in the Turkish 
      interest, and for fine, confused thinking would be hard to beat&mdash;is about 
      the finest of the lot. One can, however, easily exaggerate his importance. 
      The total population of India is 317,000,000. Out of this immense 
      reservoir, scarcely a million men could be found who were fit to serve in 
      the late war; and of this million only a fraction were Mohammedans. The 
      bulk of the 66,000,000 Moslems of India are peaceful merchants, lawyers, 
      teachers, craftsmen, and peasants, with a sprinkling of fighting men on 
      the frontier who have little respect for their brethren of the Plains. In 
      thinking of these warlike tribes and the similarly constituted Afghan 
      across the border, one recalls Sir Pertab Singh's convincing reply to the 
      Indian Nationalist: 'If India were given self-government, there would not 
      be a virgin or a gold-piece between Peshawur and Calcutta.'<BR><BR>Here 
      one comes to the arch-difficulty about Islam&mdash;and all the semi-civilized 
      peoples, be they professing Christians or professing Mohammedans. Islam, 
      however, is almost entirely semi-civilized; which means that its leading 
      notion of political action is to murder and mutilate the men of the 
      opposing party and to violate their women. One cannot get round this fact. 
      I have lived, revolver on hip, in the midst of it, and I have known less 
      fortunate soldiers who were caught unarmed, clubbed to death by a mob of 
      savages, their bodies divided and cast out to the elements. For obvious 
      reasons the story of our women remains untold. Against such a factor no 
      league of nations can prevail, unless it be backed by force, by the 
      courage of its convictions, and by an undivided purpose. Islam then can 
      accept its decisions or break itself against a wall of steel. Islam would 
      accept such a league, and, in the long run, be spiritually by so much the 
      richer and the wiser.<BR><BR>

      align=left> aving envisaged this problem as a general idea, rather than as 
      one which very much concerns the British Empire, may I be permitted to 
      approach it on the narrower basis? There are some 100,000,000 Moslems 
      within the British Empire. Generally speaking, they are among the most 
      loyal and contented of its subjects. We respect their religion and their 
      code of law&mdash;the two are inextricably combined; they have been spared or 
      reclaimed from the despotisms, the futile wars, massacres, fanaticisms, 
      and savageries which are the constant and never-changing marks of the 
      self-governed peoples of Islam.<BR><BR>Europe, down to the end of the 
      Thirty Years' War, was similarly accursed; and it is with the European of 
      an even earlier age than that that one may best compare our Moslem fellow 
      citizens. Therefore the words Democracy, Parliamentary Government, and 
      Constitutionalism have no real meaning to the ordinary Mohammedan, who 
      regards all government as a thing outside himself, wherein he has no 
      voice. It is the business of a government to govern; and it is his 
      business to be led. That is his way of looking at it. He does not want to 
      vote or waste his time attending meetings; he recognizes that Allah has 
      made certain men whose destiny it is to be Masters, and myriads of other 
      men whose destiny it is to work at their handicraft or to cultivate the 
      soil. The whole thing rests with Allah. If he be ruled by Christians, he 
      does not much mind; and if he be ruled by Moslems, so much the better. He 
      is not a political animal; he has other excitements, spiritual and 
      sensual, which, in his opinion, we Occidentals undervalue. He likes his 
      rulers to be just, and, when injustice becomes unendurable, he rises in 
      his wrath, if he be strong enough, and slays them. A good liar, in the 
      shape of a priest or a political agitator, let us say, can usually 
      convince him of anything, and therefore his own rulers have invariably 
      lopped off the heads of such orators. This simple remedy is far-sighted, 
      in that it usually saves the killing of a hundred, or even a thousand, 
      dupes.<BR><BR>Our own methods of government, however, do not admit of 
      these solutions. Our object is to get good men and send them to the East, 
      there to maintain law and order and blaze a trail for Western knowledge. 
      We have not always been wise in these appointments, and of late years they 
      have been too much dictated by interest,&mdash;political interest and class 
      interest,&mdash;and by the desire to find some 'nice young man an easy job. A 
      cad in the East, or a tomfool, be he never so blue-blooded or meticulously 
      intellectual, can do infinite harm. The Oriental is a student of men and 
      not of books, and he is quick and unerring in his estimates. The war has 
      handicapped us greatly; we have lost so many of our best men, and many 
      others have been temporarily withdrawn, serving in the army, the navy, or 
      wherever a place could be found for them.<BR><BR>Unless he be their 
      superior in character and breeding, the white man has no earthly business 
      to impose his will upon the less developed races. The difference between 
      the two, as between our own masses and our own classes, is mainly one of 
      self-control. Sheer intellectuality does not matter; indeed, more often 
      than not it is a hindrance, leading to doubts and prevarications.<BR><BR>A 
      wise Egyptian of the educated class once said to me, 'The English are 
      fools; but they are honest fools. We do not want to be ruled by clever 
      people; we are clever enough ourselves; we are far too clever. Where we 
      fail is in honesty.'<BR><BR>He, at least, was honest; but the English 
      administrator need not be a fool; far from it; and my Anglophile friend is 
      not to be taken too literally.<BR><BR>An ideal solution for the 
      recruitment of our Imperial Civil Service would be to employ a somewhat 
      similar method to that employed in our navy. Our future Nelsons are caught 
      young; they are the inheritors of a great tradition; the service is, in 
      many of its aspects, a lay priesthood. Personal selection by a board of 
      veteran officers is the main principle of this method; so that character 
      and early training, a genuine vocation, are sought for, rather than any 
      kind of special knowledge which answers to the limited tests of a written 
      examination. The whole thing is more a dedication than a profession, and 
      its rewards are paid in honor as much as in current coin. To-day the 
      service has been reorganized on a basis which opens the higher ranks to 
      whosoever is fit to enter them, and officers and men are often 'a band of 
      brothers.' Sailoring, incidentally, once an art or craft, has now become 
      one of the learned occupations. Our Imperial Civil Service might fitly be 
      a rival to our Naval Service; and even, if a more or less general 
      disarmament is to entail the reduction of the two senior services, then 
      such a Civil Service might well replace and carry on the great traditions 
      of our oldtime fleets and armies.<BR><BR>In the East, where money, and the 
      prestige which goes with money, count for so much, the pay should be 
      adequate, and more than adequate, to the responsibility. Nor should any 
      young man be allowed to occupy a position of consequence&mdash;and the lowest 
      position is one of consequence where the white man is the observed of all 
      observers&mdash;unless he can write and speak one language of the country, and 
      prove himself something of an expert in its psychology, religion, history, 
      and ethnology. Nor is a man of much use in the East unless he become a 
      lover of horses, dogs, and children. The rest will come to him easily 
      enough if he can master these. The above conditions are only theoretically 
      fulfilled under our present systems of administration.<BR><BR>In the war, 
      the conclusions and inconclusions of which are still distressing the 
      world's peace-makers, one was constantly finding food for merriment, and 
      more often for disgust, in the official attitude toward such men as 
      Lawrence, Firth, or Edmund Candler&mdash;I name but those whose names come most 
      readily. There were a round dozen of such men on every Oriental front, and 
      every effort that could be made to stultify or minimize their abilities 
      was duly made. Lawrence, thanks largely to the enthusiasm of an American 
      admirer, is now revealed to the whole world; but a system which cannot 
      extend spontaneous welcome to such a man stands self-condemned. In 
      addition to the regular imperial civil servant, a place ought to be left 
      for the irregular whose undeniable qualifications can only enrich and 
      broaden the none too remarkable reservoirs of human power now 
      extant.<BR><BR>The old stagers will laugh at me when I make a yet more 
      singular suggestion. Being bored and unoccupied in the depot at Kantara, I 
      applied one day for a civil post in Palestine or Syria. By an early mail a 
      form was sent me, asking me to state where and how I had been educated, 
      the occupation and rank of my father, and a dozen other equally fatuous 
      questions. Naturally, I tore this document across; for I have known men, 
      educated at Harrow and Oxford, let us say, and the sons of impeccable 
      fathers, who were totally unfit to be trusted with a five-pound note. And, 
      absurd as it may appear to the official mind, I have found perhaps an even 
      greater proportion of youngsters and grown men, with the qualities that 
      make for courageous and honest administration, among those connected with 
      the Boy Scout movement than in any such general reservoir as has been 
      indicated. And I will even go so far as to say that from this particular 
      source might be drawn a goodly number of potential 
      administrators.<BR><BR>The undeniable mental and moral deterioration which 
      is often induced by too long a sojourn under Eastern skies is a factor 
      that no determined survey of the situation can overlook. Long leaves and 
      plenty of outdoor sport and recreation are the surest preventives; but 
      where these fail, there is only one alternative. The white official who 
      has gone rotten must be removed. It has ceased to be a personal question; 
      It is a matter that touches the honor, the worth or unworth, of a whole 
      race.<BR><BR>And now, reviewing this whole subject in an English light, 
      one must inevitably arrive at certain conclusions. If our domination over 
      Islam, or over any other of the more primitive peoples, means one thing 
      more than another, it means that we are trying to fit them for 
      self-government. Success, for us, means, therefore, a renunciation. If we 
      succeed and teach the Indian and Egyptian and the peoples of Palestine and 
      Mesopotamia to 'run their own show,' then we will have done what we set 
      out to do. There can be but one logical end to such a mission. It will 
      mean that many white men will be cut off from pleasant and interesting 
      jobs; it will mean that some of these will cry aloud and turn prophet. The 
      air will be filled with evil tidings. We are, however, quite definitely 
      committed to the Christian point of view; and, moreover, it is so deeply 
      bitten into our nature that, try as we may, we cannot escape from 
      it.<BR><BR>And, accepting this argument, the peoples who are so fitted for 
      self-government in the modern world will no longer be the peoples of 
      Islam. Call themselves what they may, they will have accepted our ideals, 
      and with them our gods. A remnant may continue in the deserts of Arabia 
      and Africa, or in the mountains of Central Asia; and their sport, their 
      business, their politics, will still be war. Well, we were ever a sporting 
      nation. But Islam of the plains, the valleys, and the cities will have 
      ceased to be Islam; just as the Christianity of to-day has ceased to be 
      the Christianity of the Crusades, the stake, the conquistadors, and the 
      Inquisition.<BR><BR>On the other hand,&mdash;and there is a good deal of 
      evidence in favor of this supposition,&mdash;it may be that the primitive races 
      are incapable of responding to the demands and pressure of the modern 
      world, and that it is the ungrateful destiny of the white race to function 
      as a ruler. The late Mr. Roosevelt, admirably indiscreet, has said the 
      last word on this subject.<BR><BR>Or one may contemplate a third solution, 
      disgusting and abominable, and yet, under our present dispensations, not 
      altogether impossible. The Christian world may destroy itself,&mdash;it has 
      done, and is doing its uttermost in this direction,&mdash;and leave the more 
      primitive peoples in possession. These&mdash;cheap, fertile, and nearer to the 
      earth&mdash;may be our heirs; and amid these, Islam, patient, shrewd, observant, 
      is watching our antics and hoping for best.<BR><BR><!--ARTICLE CONTENT ENDS--><!--endclickprintinclude--><!--CONTINUED--><!--POST & RIPOSTE-->
