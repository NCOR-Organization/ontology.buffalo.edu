      <DIV class=headbold>The Longest War</DIV><BR>
      <DIV class=headreg>The fight we&rsquo;re in didn&rsquo;t begin on September 11; it 
      started thousands of years ago. It&rsquo;s the struggle between East and West, 
      and history can both encourage and help us—if we read it 
      properly.</DIV><BR>
      <DIV class=headitalic>by Victor Davis Hanson</DIV><BR><PRE>
</PRE>
      <P>About as many americans were killed in the terrorist attacks of 
      September 11 as at Lexington and Concord, at the Alamo, at Fort Sumter, on 
      the <I>Lusitania,</I> and at Pearl Harbor combined, all of which 
      precipitated Americans&rsquo; entry into major wars. Where else can we turn but 
      to history to make sense of such carnage? Yet many facile comparisons that 
      are being made with the past are fraught with error. They tell more of our 
      own popular perceptions of culture than of the real lessons of history, 
      and they misinform us about every element of the situation, from its 
      underlying politics to the nature of the terrorism involved, the proper 
      role of the military in our nation&rsquo;s survival, the broader cultural 
      context, and the true philosophy of war itself.</P>
      <P></P>
      <P></P>
      <P><B>I. Politics</B></P>
      <P>Many Americans, gazing in horror at passenger jets crashing into the 
      World Trade Center and the Pentagon, asked themselves what the nation had 
      done to deserve such hatred, forgetting that history teaches us that wars 
      often break out over professed rather than authentic grievances. In a 
      famous passage in Thucydides&rsquo; history <I>The Peloponnesian War,</I> the 
      Athenians say that the source of conflict hinges on a state&rsquo;s perceived 
      sense of &ldquo;honor, fear, and self-interest.&rdquo; </P>
      <P>In this classical way of thinking, irrational statesmen (Hitler, 
      Mussolini, Tojo) often provoke conflicts over perfectly rational goals 
      (more land, natural resources, subject peoples), by inflaming their 
      audiences with appeals to rectify past injuries that are, in fact, 
      nonexistent. The Japanese and Germans were <I>not</I> starving in 1941, 
      but rather were proud peoples who wanted those whom they deemed inferior 
      to serve them.</P>
      <P>In truth, Osama bin Laden and the Taliban have very few legitimate 
      grievances against the United States. We intervened in the Muslim world 
      during the last two decades in part for our own interests, but we also 
      saved the Afghanis from communism, the Kuwaitis from the Iraqis, Shiites 
      and Kurds from Saddam Hussein, Somalians from hunger, and Bosnians and 
      Kosovars from Christian Serbians. Millions of Muslims have been butchered 
      on battlefields over the past 30 years, but their killers have been 
      Islamic Iranians, Iraqis, Jordanians, Lebanese, and Afghanis. If 
      Thucydides&rsquo; exegesis on war&rsquo;s causes is still relevant, bin Laden is more 
      correctly seen as an inherently evil man who hates and envies us for our 
      clout and our influence. He may rightly understand that America is the 
      chief obstacle to his wish to lord over a medieval caliphate spanning a 
      united Middle East, under a brand of thirteenth-century Islam that makes 
      decadent Westerners cower in fear. That simple explanation seems to offer 
      more consistent logic than do all the neo-Marxist or Freudian-inspired 
      critiques of our foreign policy, or all the reasons bin Laden himself has 
      proffered for his hatred of America: our military protection of Saudi oil, 
      Israelis on Palestinian land, the hateful modernism of global democracy 
      and capitalism, Jewish American women walking in the land of Mecca, and so 
      on.</P>
      <P>What does the past teach us about bin Laden&rsquo;s undeniable appeal to his 
      followers? Is his magnetism the harvest of real oppression brought on by 
      years of American colonialism and imperialism? Our own history argues 
      against it. Millions in Mexico and Africa are poorer than the hijackers 
      and their followers, but they have not rallied to the cause of an 
      international terrorist. The Ottomans, another Muslim state, ran much of 
      the Middle East from the fifteenth to the early twentieth century, far 
      longer and with a much heavier hand than the British or the French ever 
      did, and Americans had no real foreign role in the Muslim world before 
      World War II.</P>
      <P>Have American economic policies more recently impoverished the Arab 
      masses, giving bin Laden a receptive audience? Far more forcefully than 
      either Asia or South America, the Muslim world has rejected the twin 
      forces of global capitalism and democracy. In fact, there is not a single 
      Arab consensual government in existence, and in most countries the state 
      has a near stranglehold on utilities, the media, banks, and industry, 
      ensuring a bloated and ineffective public work force and a complete 
      absence of either foreign or domestic competition. Failure to emulate 
      Western market economies and constitutional governments is probably the 
      chief reason why living standards in the Middle East, despite extravagant 
      oil and natural gas deposits, lag so far behind those of other continents. 
      Revolutionary Islamic movements, which promise Muslim utopias based on 
      strict adherence to the Koran and the exclusion of foreign ideas, have, in 
      fact, ruined their countries.</P>
      <P>What, then, is the allure that millions of Muslims find in bin Laden&rsquo;s 
      hatred? We know he is a multimillionaire who can hire thousands and reach 
      tens of thousands more through media and public relations. Like a 
      blackmailing Mafia don, he has also received substantial help from 
      governments in Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Egypt, Syria, and, of course, 
      Iraq—all regimes with tightly controlled presses, whose records of 
      bringing freedom, prosperity, and happiness to their populations are 
      dismal. Most of them are terrified of Islamic fundamentalism. </P>
      <P>Rather than allow real constitutional change that might lead to 
      democracy, such Arab rulers have instead either quietly paid bin Laden 
      bribe money (the Gulf states) or allowed their censored presses to vent 
      popular anger only against America and Israel (Egypt and Palestine). Here 
      our policy of not intervening to insist on gradual democratization has 
      been understandable, because of our worry over world oil supplies, but it 
      is nevertheless objectionable, most notably when we reinstalled the 
      monarchy in a liberated Kuwait rather than insist on free elections. In an 
      irony of history, the promotion of democratic movements in Afghanistan, 
      Iran, and Iraq may be our best way to oppose Islamic fundamentalism, even 
      while showing our anger at the often duplicitous policies of our so-called 
      allies and friends like Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of America&rsquo;s support for Israel, especially in bin 
      Laden&rsquo;s own pronouncements and in the scenes of Palestinian crowds 
      cheering news of the World Trade Center slaughter. Yet, like Saddam 
      Hussein, bin Laden embraced the Palestinian cause only when his own future 
      turned bleak. Despite his accusations, our sympathies are not attributable 
      to some mythical Jewish lobby, CIA plot to put down Islam, or worldwide 
      conspiracy of Zionist Mossad agents. Most Americans support Israel because 
      it is the single Middle Eastern state most like us in its commitment to a 
      free society based on the rule of law and the consent of the governed.</P><!--table for pullquote-->

            <DIV class=headboldgray>We are told we have entered a &ldquo;new&rdquo; age of 
            terror.</DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><!--end table for pullquole-->
      <P>The ultimate solution to that quagmire will be the creation of a 
      Palestinian state, with the security of Israel guaranteed by a formal 
      American treaty along with some concessions from both sides. But we should 
      remember that earlier wars waged against Israel had as their goal nothing 
      less than the destruction of the Jewish state, and that if both Israel and 
      the United States were to disappear tomorrow, bin Laden or his successors 
      would nevertheless continue to be agents of terror.</P>
      <P></P>
      <P></P>
      <P><B>II. Terror</B></P>
      <P>We are repeatedly told that we have entered a &ldquo;new&rdquo; age of terror, in 
      which a handful of willing fanatics with a few thousand dollars can negate 
      sophisticated power and the investment of billions of dollars. Yet neither 
      bin Laden nor terrorism is new, and so the solutions to their threats are 
      not only known but time-honored. Our steep initial losses—$100 billion in 
      property, a trillion in capital stock, and of course the dead—resulted far 
      less from any intrinsic weaknesses than from the laxity and naivet&eacute; that 
      characterize free democratic societies during times of peace. And we 
      should remember that aroused consensual societies usually find ways to 
      thwart unconventional challenges of terror, be they from Stuka 
      dive-bombers, kamikazes, V-2 rockets, or the burning of oil wells, and 
      that those societies annihilate rather than merely defeat their 
      enemies.</P>
      <P>Bin Laden is not a figure of national liberation such as Vercingetorix, 
      Crazy Horse, or Mao. Rather, he is more one of the marginal fanatics of 
      history, the B-team, who, long after their countries were exposed to 
      Western culture, their heritage and future forever altered, have sought to 
      employ terror and mysticism to rally the disaffected around a messianic 
      figure. His ancestors are the Zealots, or Sicarii (&ldquo;cutters&rdquo; or 
      &ldquo;assassins&rdquo;), who, after the Roman occupation of Judea, tried to murder 
      legionaries before flocking behind Eleazar ben Yair to commit mass suicide 
      on Masada. Similarly, Muhammad Ahmad, the Mahdi, the &ldquo;Expected Guide,&rdquo; 
      wreaked havoc in Egypt and the Sudan between 1881 and 1885, after it was 
      too late. For a brief moment, his followers enjoyed loose hegemony over a 
      million square miles, and they killed or scattered more than 40,000 
      troops. Like bin Laden, Muhammad Ahmad had traveled widely, knew something 
      of Westerners, and devised a clever propaganda campaign of fundamentalist 
      jihad based on opposition to Westernized Arabs who worked under the 
      British. He met his end in 1885, and his followers were wiped out some 
      years later at the Battle of Omdurman, where there were 27,000 Mahdist 
      casualties and 48 British dead.</P>
      <P>In the same manner, the Ghost Dancers of 1890, who were Native American 
      mystics, promised their followers divine invulnerability from enemy 
      bullets and even immortality in a final attempt to expel settlers from the 
      Great Plains and reclaim ancestral lands. They were crushed. Likewise, in 
      the early 1930s, Gen. Isamu Cho led a group of fanatical Japanese officers 
      who aimed to assassinate elected Japanese politicians, start a war against 
      Russia in Manchuria, and spread Bushido, the code of the samurai, through 
      the imperial army. He gleaned his rantings from samurai tradition and 
      promised success against Western devils through mystical Japanese courage. 
      The careers of all these insurrectionists, whatever the legitimacy of 
      their grievances, are instructive about bin Laden&rsquo;s fate. All were both 
      attracted and repelled by Western cultural largess, all sought reactionary 
      remedies for their own fears of shrinking power, all concocted strange 
      brews of religious fanaticism and myth, and all perished before the power 
      of the West, whether that be Roman siegecraft, the U.S. cavalry, Victorian 
      Maxim guns, or the M-1&rsquo;s of the Marines on Okinawa.</P>
      <P>Not merely terrorist leaders but terror itself has been met and trumped 
      in the past. At Okinawa, in 1945, American GI&rsquo;s faced tens of thousands of 
      Japanese diehards (backed by suicide bombers in planes and on boats) 
      concealed in coral caves and often emerging in banzai charges with 
      explosives strapped to their bodies. Despite 2,000 kamikaze attacks, 34 
      ships sunk and 368 damaged, more than 12,000 American dead and 38,000 more 
      wounded, and 100,000 Japanese killed, plus another 100,000 civilian 
      casualties, the Americans took Okinawa in less than three months, albeit 
      at such a cost that similar attacks planned on the mainland were shelved 
      in favor of atomic weapons. Moreover, after the first 2,000 kamikaze 
      sorties, the Japanese air force had real difficulty finding volunteers, 
      <I>kichigai</I> (madmen), for the squadrons of the &ldquo;Divine Wind.&rdquo; They had 
      to begin forcibly conscripting pilots, many of whom often sought to divert 
      their planes and return home.</P>
      <P>In short, throughout history, the opponents of Western civilization who 
      have lacked its discipline and firepower have turned to terror and suicide 
      in their struggles to even the odds. They have caused great loss of life 
      and spread fear through European and American societies, which themselves 
      have no traditions of suicidal corps, but without exception they have been 
      beaten by the greater terror of discipline, resolve, vigilance, new 
      tactics, and the firepower of industrial weaponry.</P>
      <P>As we acclimate ourselves to the reappearance of terrorists, we should 
      remember that they are not, and have never been, completely secretive in 
      their operations. They need bases, banks, transportation, and lodging, and 
      therefore they must have friendly host governments that can be cajoled, 
      threatened, or destroyed if they offer sanctuary. Pakistan&rsquo;s sudden 
      reversal in sentiment and Libya&rsquo;s gestures of help are indications not of 
      inherent goodwill or moral conversion but rather of fear of the appearance 
      of American warships on the horizon.</P>
      <P></P>
      <P></P>
      <P><B>III. Military</B></P>
      <P>Americans heard horror stories of a landlocked and rugged Afghanistan, 
      the quagmire that had purportedly swallowed Alexander the Great, 
      nineteenth-century British colonialists, and Soviet communists alike. Yet 
      Alexander, in fact, first overran Afghanistan, and with fewer than 30,000 
      troops, despite factional rivalries in his army and his self-destructive 
      murdering of his own top lieutenants. Britain withdrew after the First 
      Afghanistan War because of errors of arrogance, logistics, and tactical 
      incompetence but returned to pacify the country by 1878 and went on to run 
      it from India without incident until 1919. The Soviets lost largely 
      because the United States gave billions in aid and weapons to their 
      enemies, while they made a foolhardy and evil attempt to wipe out Islam. 
      The Russian army in the last decade of communism was inadequately 
      supplied, and demoralized, clearly not of the caliber of the one that had 
      stopped Hitler in the far more difficult street fighting at Stalingrad. 
      Yet before the arrival of countless American Stinger antiaircraft missiles 
      and sophisticated Chinese machine guns, it was approaching victory.</P>
      <P>The past wars in Afghanistan offer clear caveats. Attempts to create a 
      satrapy through the destruction of local religions and tribal affinities 
      while introducing foreign customs usually fail, as do large conventional 
      land armies forced to be stationary while they impose colonial rule. Yet 
      the country offers little vegetation and is ideal for air operations; as 
      in Vietnam, indigenous forces on the ground, backed by special-operations 
      troops and American airpower, have already shown that they can destroy the 
      morale of the Taliban without suffering crippling losses. Also, unlike 
      prior invaders, Americans have been prepared to strike with no illusions 
      about the ease of their task and with no wish for conquest, lucre, or 
      obeisance. Our generals are neither arrogant nor naive, and we have no 
      interest in occupying the country or in turning its people from medieval 
      Islam to preferring the benefits of popular American culture. </P>
      <P>Comparisons are often made between the present conflict and Vietnam. 
      Again, few recent wars are more misunderstood. In the 1960s and early 
      1970s, we were fighting a distant battle against foes supplied by our two 
      chief nuclear rivals, China and the Soviet Union, both of which had sent 
      thousands of active advisers and combatants there. Our list of permitted 
      targets in the North was small, and it often shrank. We defined our goal 
      as creating an enlightened democratic culture in South Vietnam, where none 
      had ever existed. The draft ensured that our youth in universities would 
      take to the streets. Even with all that, our forces fought superbly. At 
      the so-called debacle at Hue, the Marines lost fewer than 150, killed some 
      5,000, and freed the city in the worst street fighting since the Korean 
      War. The siege of Khe Sanh was an enemy failure that resulted in more than 
      1,600 communist dead for 250 Americans lost. In the horrific Tet 
      offensive, a surprised American military inflicted 40,000 fatalities on 
      the attackers while losing fewer than 2,500. </P>
      <P>Vietnam was a military defeat, but that was because of the poor tactics 
      of our generals, who were hobbled by the larger geopolitical situation of 
      the time. Today, America&rsquo;s political landscape is hardly beset by civil 
      unrest. Instead, there is unity and recognition that our home soil has 
      been attacked. Nor is the country likely to see an overseas war as a nexus 
      of domestic racial, sexual, and cultural unrest. Our present Secretary of 
      State and national security adviser are African-American, our military is 
      coed, and its officer corps is fully integrated and diversely represented. 
      Criticism of the current war therefore will not be couched in the lexicon 
      of Vietnam, especially when those most likely to die in the war are 
      American civilians at home and highly trained and professional pilots 
      rather than reluctant adolescent draftees.</P>
      <P>During the initial phases of the American bombing campaign in 
      Afghanistan, impatient critics raised false analogies with the past in 
      attempts to dismiss the effectiveness of airpower. It is true that bombing 
      has been greatly misunderstood, partly because of the inflated promises of 
      early Air Force advocates and partly on moral grounds, recalling the 
      horrendous civilian losses inflicted on Dresden, Hamburg, and Tokyo. The 
      U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, undertaken after World War II, suggested 
      that strategic bombing hadn&rsquo;t greatly altered the war&rsquo;s outcome since 
      German industrial production had stayed the same or even increased after 
      1944. But most historians now concede that the methodology of the study 
      was severely flawed, and its conclusions cannot be trusted. The survey 
      sought to weigh damage to industrial production against the staggering 
      losses in Allied aircraft, without asking critical questions about the 
      toll taken on the German economy by the forced relocation of plants and 
      distortions in weapons production.</P>
      <P>For instance, Germany retooled after sustained American and British 
      bombing to produce 10,000 antiaircraft guns, expending resources that 
      could have been better used against advancing Russian and American armor. 
      Thousands of German aircraft were lost in the sky and on airfields in 
      homeland defense, and fatal decisions were made to retaliate against 
      incendiary attacks with rocketry and jet bombers when the precious 
      industrial capacity that provided them should have been allotted to 
      ammunition, tanks, and fighter planes. And B-17s and B-24s used 
      tactically—to disrupt transportation in France before the Normandy 
      campaign, to bomb German armor in preparation for the American 
      breakout—were deadly.</P>
      <P>The fire raids by B-29s on Japanese cities are highly controversial in 
      terms of their brutality, but not in terms of their effectiveness. 
      Essentially, Gen. Curtis LeMay incinerated the main urban centers of Japan 
      in a matter of weeks, mined its major harbors, and drastically curtailed 
      even widely dispersed industrial production among residential 
      neighborhoods, ensuring that naval and air resistance by mid-1945 would be 
      minimal and that large land forces, such as those at Okinawa, could not be 
      supplied from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Bombing since World War II is equally misunderstood. Despite 
      restrictions on targets, devastating air attacks by B-29s during the 
      Korean War restored equilibrium and, with help from American artillery, 
      devastated the Chinese army. Many of China&rsquo;s purported one million dead in 
      Korea were annihilated by tactical bombing, which explains why the nation 
      was not eager to enter the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the record is more 
      checkered; it worsened as ever more dramatic results were demanded from 
      airpower on its own. Carpet attacks on rural areas in the South proved 
      ineffective and inhumane, in sharp contrast with the more limited raids on 
      Haiphong and Hanoi, especially during the last months of the war, when 
      first-generation smart bombs brought the communist leadership back to the 
      peace table. Airpower alone could not have won the Vietnam War, but the 
      freedom to strike continuously and unrestrictedly at command and control 
      in the North in the mid-1970s might well have brought the hostilities to a 
      standstill.</P>
      <P>The last decade has witnessed a revolution in bombing, as the old banes 
      of airpower—ineffectiveness, collateral damage, and aircraft losses—have 
      been vastly reduced through technological breakthroughs. What was once 
      seen as a very costly and often inhumane method of attack has now been 
      transmogrified into a relatively precise, tolerable, and safe tactic of 
      retaliation, permitting the houses and offices of the enemy, rather than 
      merely a country&rsquo;s industrial and military assets, to be singled out for 
      selective demolition. In that regard, the quickness of the land war in the 
      Persian Gulf was due largely to weeks of preliminary bombardment. The 
      attacks in Kosovo proved to be exclusively an air campaign, and the 
      Serbian leadership gave in without a single American fatality.</P>
      <P>The lesson, then, is not that airpower can alone win wars. It cannot. 
      Rather, with new generations of complex ordnance and sophisticated 
      technology, bombers can increase their already prominent role to match the 
      importance of conventional ground forces, shorten the war, and thus save 
      lives on both sides. </P>

      <P>The fighting in the Middle East must also be seen in the context of the 
      long tradition of the Western way of war itself. Across some 2,500 years, 
      the real danger for a Western power has always been another Western power. 
      More Greeks died in a single battle of the Peloponnesian War than in all 
      the fighting against the Persians; Alexander killed more Greeks in a day 
      than did Darius III in three years. The Boers killed more Britons in a 
      week than the Zulus did in a year. More Americans died at Antietam than in 
      50 years of frontier fighting. We can draw assurance from the fact that 
      America is not fighting Britain, Germany, or Japan, or even a 
      semi-Westernized China or India, nations that desperately seek to emulate 
      our military organization, training, and armament.</P><!--table for pullquote-->

      <P>Western nations from the Greeks to the present are not weak at war but 
      enormously lethal, far out of proportion to their sometimes relatively 
      small populations and territories. This is not an accident of geography or 
      a matter of natural resources or genes. The climate of Egypt of the 
      Pharaohs did not change under the Ptolemies, but the two were still quite 
      different societies. The Mycenaeans (1600 to 1200 b.c.) spoke Greek and 
      raised olives, but they were a world away from the citizens of the 
      city-state (700 to 300 b.c.) that arose amid their ruins.</P>
      <P>Nor is our power merely an accident of superior technology; rather, it 
      is founded on our very ideas and values. The underpinnings of Western 
      culture—freedom, civic militarism, capitalism, individualism, 
      constitutional government, secular rationalism, and natural inquiry 
      relatively immune from political audit and religious backlash—have always 
      brought carnage to adversaries when applied on the battlefield. Setbacks 
      from Cannae to the Little Bighorn have led not to capitulation but rather 
      to study, debate, analysis—and, finally, devastating reprisals. Too few 
      men too far away, a bad day, terrible weather, silly generals like Custer, 
      or enemy geniuses such as Hannibal, all can usually be trumped in the long 
      run by the systematic approach to war that is emblematic of our culture. 
      The terrible protocols of the West at war have already made themselves 
      known to the terrorists we are fighting, who had no idea what they were 
      arousing. Instead of parading pictures of bin Laden in the streets, the 
      Taliban would have done better to study the history of the names of the 
      American ships off their shores: <I>USS Peleliu, Enterprise,</I> and 
      <I>Roosevelt.</I></P>
      <P>Indeed, our Western ideals revealed themselves even during and right 
      after the terrorist attacks: doomed airline passengers voting to storm the 
      hijackers to prevent further carnage to their countrymen; Congress freely 
      voting to find vast sums of capital for military operations; bizarre 
      military hardware and frightening weapons of death flashing on our 
      television screens as they headed eastward; media critics and pundits 
      openly lauding and criticizing U.S. actions past, present, and future, and 
      thereby helping us define the nature of both the threat and our response; 
      individual rescue workers, aided by huge and sophisticated machines, 
      devising on their own initiative ad hoc methods of saving victims and 
      calming a devastated city. The Taliban and their supporters in the Middle 
      East, like the Ottomans of old, are, to put it plainly, parasitic on 
      Western civilization. A bin Laden can kill Americans only through terror, 
      stealth, Western technology, and familiarity with American culture. Cell 
      phones, the Internet, frequent-flier miles, and Boeing 767 pilot lessons 
      are not indigenous to the Middle East.</P><!--table for picture/caption-->

      <P>Neither the genius of Mithridates nor the wasting diseases of the 
      tropics or the fanaticism of the Mahdists have stopped the heroes, 
      idealists, megalomaniacs, and imperialists of past Western armies, whose 
      occasional lapses have led not to capitulation but to follow-ups far more 
      deadly than their enemies&rsquo; temporary victories. This is a question not of 
      morality per se but of military capacity. It would have been less hurtful 
      for all involved had the thug Pizarro stayed put in Spain or the 
      sanctimonious Lord Chelmsford kept out of Zululand.</P>
      <P>In our peace and affluence, we Americans of a complacent era have 
      forgotten the lethal superiority of the Western way of war: the Greeks 
      losing only 192 at Marathon, Alexander the Great destroying an empire of 
      70 million with an army of 40,000, Cort&eacute;s wrecking an imperial people of 2 
      million in less than two years, or a small band of British redcoats ending 
      the power of Cetshwayo and his Zulus for good in less than a year. We have 
      forgotten that the arsenal of tiny sixteenth-century Venice—a republic 
      based on principles of market capitalism and audit surrounded by a West 
      torn by Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism—launched far better and 
      more numerous galleys than those of the entire Ottoman navy. After the 
      Battle of Lepanto, in 1571, the salvage crews collected the Ottomans&rsquo; 
      cannon—themselves copied on Venetian and German designs—for scrap, so 
      inferior were they to their European models. At Midway, the American 
      code-breakers, products of free universities and nursed on egalitarianism 
      and the right to inquire without political and religious censure, helped 
      win the battle before it even began. The Japanese military had nothing 
      like them. In today&rsquo;s climate of cultural relativism, we are not supposed 
      to say such things, but they are true, and they give us pause for 
      reflection on the prognosis of the present military situation. </P>
      <P>Greece&rsquo;s hoplites, like all Western armies, defined discipline not in 
      terms of swordplay, captive taking, or individual bravado but in terms of 
      keeping in rank, marching in time, drilling, and attacking in unison. And 
      so at the Battle of Cunaxa, in 401, they slaughtered their Persian 
      opponents while incurring not a single fatality. Roman legions, Spanish 
      harquebusiers, and British squares followed in the same tradition and left 
      corpses all over the globe. After the disaster at Cannae, where Hannibal&rsquo;s 
      genius killed 600 legionaries a minute, the Roman legions still grew, 
      while Carthage&rsquo;s mercenary armies shrank. Such civic militarism is a 
      trademark of Western armies, whose soldiers are not serfs or tribesmen but 
      fight as citizens with rights and responsibilities. The last radio 
      transmissions of doomed New York City firefighters reveal not just 
      professionalism but a true sense of egalitarianism and democratic 
      affinity.</P>
      <P>In the months to come, American ground and air forces, with better 
      weapons, better supplies, better discipline, and more imaginative 
      commanders, audited constantly by an elected Congress and President and 
      scrutinized by a free press, will in fact destroy the very foundations of 
      radical Islamic fundamentalism. Indeed, virtually the only check on the 
      terrifying power of Western armies, other than other Western armies, is 
      not enemy spears or bullets but the voices of our own internal dissent: a 
      Bernardino de Sahagún aghast at his people&rsquo;s cruelty in Mexico, a Bishop 
      Colenso remonstrating against the British government about the needless 
      destruction of Zululand, a Jane Fonda going to Hanoi to protest the war in 
      Vietnam, or a CNN broadcasting unverifiable reports of civilian deaths. 
      The Taliban and the hosts of murderers with bases in Pakistan, Iraq, and 
      Syria may find solace in the words of Western clergy and academics, but 
      they will not find it in the American military.</P>
      <P>America is not only the inheritor of the European military tradition 
      but in many ways its most potent incarnation. Our multiracial and 
      radically egalitarian society has taken the concepts of freedom and market 
      capitalism to their theoretical limits, to the great worry of critics on 
      both the left and the right. While it is easy to ridicule the crassness of 
      our culture and the collective amnesia of our masses, we must not 
      underestimate the lethal military dynamism that such an energetic and 
      restless citizenry accrues. Right now, background means little in 
      comparison with our present ambition, drive, and ingenuity. For all the 
      talk of a cultural mosaic, we are still a nation and a melting pot, as the 
      composition of our military and its resulting effectiveness show.</P><!--table for pullquote-->

      <P>Look at a sampling of the names of dead firefighters in New York: 
      Weinberg, Mojica, Brown, Angelini, Schrang, Amato, Hanley, Gullickson, 
      Guadalupe. These rescuers were united not by hue or accent but, like those 
      in the legions, by a shared professionalism and desire for action. So our 
      creed is not class, race, breeding, or propriety, but unchecked energy, as 
      so often expressed in our machines, our competitiveness, and our unabashed 
      audacity. These are powerful assets when we turn from the arts of 
      production to those of destruction.</P>
      <P></P>
      <P></P>
      <P><B>V. Philosophy</B></P>
      <P>If we are so strong, then, why have so many Americans been doubtful 
      about the future and poorly acquainted with their past? Certainly the 
      devastation of the first two world wars, the threat of nuclear 
      annihilation, and the fiasco of Vietnam predisposed them to see history in 
      therapeutic rather than tragic terms. Out of those horrors of the 
      twentieth century, social sciences emerged to prove that war itself—rather 
      than particular unjust and unnecessary wars—was always evil and therefore 
      preventable. Indeed, during the International Year of Peace, 1986, a 
      global commission of experts concluded that war was unnatural and humans 
      themselves unwarlike. </P>
      <P>Consequently, we now tend to believe that war always results from 
      concrete, rather than professed, injustice, especially poverty brought 
      about by colonialism, imperialism, racism, sexism, and so on. As a result, 
      dialogue and mediation have been elevated to the grand science of 
      conflict-resolution theory, a sort of divorce counseling on the 
      international level. And such naivet&eacute; and relativism have affected the 
      very way we look at our current conflict, when we imagine that bin Laden 
      is either ignorant, insane, or partly justified, rather than purely evil, 
      and that his followers can be counseled, instead of annihilated like the 
      fascists of Germany and Japan.</P>
      <P>Moral equivalence has often trumped the idea of the just war in the 
      media coverage of our bombing campaign in Afghanistan. We have listened to 
      suggestions that we are &ldquo;killing babies.&rdquo; In fact, we do know that 
      thousands of innocent civilians were murdered on September 11, but we do 
      not have sure knowledge of how many Afghani citizens have been killed from 
      the air by misplaced American bombs, Taliban shells falling back among 
      their citizens, or Taliban executions and terrorism against their own 
      people. We do know that it was the deliberate policy of the Taliban to put 
      their combatants among mosques, hospitals, and schools to ensure their 
      survival out of the expectation that Americans, unlike them, would not 
      deliberately kill civilians. If our enemies know that moral difference, 
      why do not our own citizens? </P>
      <P>The dead, of course, are the dead, and their loss is tragic. But there 
      is a difference, a very moral difference, between deliberately targeting 
      civilians in peace and deliberately trying not to in war. Moreover, not 
      even the most just war has been waged with moral perfection. Rather, just 
      civilizations have warred, as America did against Germany and Japan, with 
      the full knowledge that innocents may have to die if mass murder by evil 
      governments is to be stopped.</P>
      <P>The civilians of Afghanistan are in large part noncombatants, but they 
      are not all completely innocent, in the sense that many expressed 
      gratification, even glee, as did many in Pakistan too, over the deaths of 
      thousands of Americans. Like those who shouted <I>banzai</I>en masse in 
      Tokyo after the capture of Nanking and the bombing of Pearl Harbor, or 
      those who toasted the Führer when he invaded Poland, they must be taught 
      where the logic of their misplaced fury leads—at a minimum in lives and 
      treasure, but taught nonetheless the wages of what Sherman called &ldquo;hard 
      war.&rdquo; Our goal is not only to replace the Taliban and dismantle terrorist 
      networks but also, by the annihilation of the Afghanistan government, to 
      teach the misguided and misled in the region that when they let slip the 
      dogs of war against America, it can be a dangerous thing indeed. Only that 
      way will they be vigilant in the future against firebrands who want to 
      take their countries down the same disastrous path as did the Taliban.</P>
      <P>Many today, certainly many in the academy, fail to see the carnage of 
      the twentieth century in terms of the classical exegesis of the need for 
      armed preparedness (the Roman military theorist Vegetius&rsquo; &ldquo;He who wishes 
      peace must prepare for war&rdquo;). We have forgotten that the nightmare of the 
      First World War could have been prevented by stern resistance to Prussian 
      militarism in 1913, that the Holocaust of the Nazis could have been 
      stopped by a firm stand against Hitler in the late 1930s, that millions 
      were saved from the carnage of the gulag and the firing squads of the 
      Russians and Chinese—two regimes that killed more in peace than died in 
      all of World Wars I and II—only through the sacrifice of the Cold War and 
      the threat of nuclear weapons. </P>
      <P>Real morality does not permit hesitating out of fear of injuring the 
      innocent or suffering casualties but rather can require enduring that and 
      more to ensure that thousands now and millions later will not grow up to 
      be murdered under terror and fascism, whose fruits we know so well from 
      the sordid history of the past century. Lincoln called such sacrifices 
      &ldquo;the terrible arithmetic.&rdquo; Sherman said of destroying enemy property, 
      &ldquo;This may seem a hard species of warfare, but it brings the sad realities 
      of war home to those who have been directly or indirectly instrumental in 
      involving us in its attendant calamities.&rdquo; In the end, Lincoln, Grant, and 
      Sherman saw that slavery was ended and the Union reunited, despite all the 
      vows from their brave, brilliant, and fiery opponents to fight to the 
      bitter end.</P>
      <P>In that regard, it is hard to learn from war, which Thucydides called 
      &ldquo;the harsh schoolmaster.&rdquo; It shatters our modernist assumption that we can 
      change the nature of man and eliminate the Neanderthal need to resort to 
      arms. America at the beginning of the millennium, awash in wealth, luxury, 
      and learning, was convinced that our enemies were either ignorant, 
      misinformed, or temporarily insane—not evil, and certainly not rationally 
      evil. And so in place of strong military preparation and the swift 
      responses to aggression that had been the wisdom of the ages, we wanted 
      lawyers to handle war as a criminal matter, or we thought we could avoid 
      it through conciliation and mediation, or by buying off our enemies with 
      money, kindness, education, apologies, or, as a last resort, the 
      occasional Tomahawk missile. It didn&rsquo;t work with bin Laden. He, after a 
      career of bombing Americans around the world, reckoned that we were 
      decadent and soft and would continue to tolerate the killing of our 
      people.</P>
      <P>Much of the relativist and therapeutic thinking in America that allowed 
      such men to flourish is generational. The upper middle classes schooled 
      during Vietnam are now in positions of power. Unlike their fathers, who 
      came of age in the Great Depression, or their children, who have not yet 
      shown a moral earnestness about righting the wrongs of the world—or 
      else!—they went into the universities, media, the arts, government, and 
      foundations convinced that they could reinvent the very nature of American 
      society just as they had stopped the war in Vietnam. </P>
      <P>Those of the professional elite now between the ages of 40 and 60 have, 
      in the last few years, often been protected through sinecures, tenure, 
      safe suburbs, select schools, and good money from the traditional checks 
      on utopianism: the unemployment, scant disposable income, muscular work, 
      and physical danger that daily confront members of the working class. In 
      that regard, it is not surprising that the actor Richard Gere was booed 
      off the stage at Madison Square Garden by the relatives and friends of 
      dead New York police and firefighters, after he lectured them on the folly 
      of armed retribution.</P><!--table for pullquote-->

            <P>In September 1898, Winston Churchill took part in the last true 
            cavalry charge in history. It was at the Battle of Omdurman, in the 
            Sudan. The 23-year-old went to the Sudan as both a soldier and a war 
            correspondent, and after he returned home, the man who would lead 
            Britain through World War II wrote the first of his many large-scale 
            historical works, The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the 
            Sudan. In this narrative of a struggle between radical Islamic 
            fanatics and the European infidels they wanted out of their land, he 
            described the Muslim cause in words that still speak to us today (if 
            with what can seem now an extreme nineteenth-century cultural 
            severity).</P>
            <P>The Sudan had been part of Egypt to the north, which was 
            nominally ruled by a khedive but really administered by the British 
            consul. In the 1880s, a Sudanese named Mohammed Ahmed named himself 
            the successor to the founder of Islam, raised an army, and launched 
            a war to drive out the infidels. After he defeated a series of 
            expeditions against him, the British withdrew until a Conservative 
            government decided to take back the Sudan in 1895.</P>
            <P>Drawing on his own experience and his study of the entire 
            three-year campaign, Churchill wrote: &ldquo;How dreadful are the curses 
            which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical 
            frenzy … there is this fearful fatalistic apathy… . Improvident 
            habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of 
            commerce… .&rdquo; (He added that &ldquo;individual Moslems may show splendid 
            qualities.&rdquo;) &ldquo;The influence of the religion paralyzes the social 
            development of those who follow it.&rdquo; Yet, &ldquo;far from being moribund, 
            Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already 
            spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every 
            step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong 
            arms of science—the science against which it has vainly 
            struggled—the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the 
            civilization of ancient Rome.&rdquo;</P>
            <P>Where were the crusaders of Islam finding their strength? In 
            Western countries, Churchill wrote, education and open thought led 
            to pride in tradition, sympathy for the downtrodden, and a 
            recognition of the dignity of the species. &ldquo;Ignorance deprives 
            savage nations of such incentives. Yet in the marvelous economy of 
            nature this very ignorance is a source of greater strength. It 
            affords them the mighty stimulus of fanaticism… . It gives men 
            something which they think is sublime to fight for, and this serves 
            them as an excuse for wars which it is desirable to begin for 
            different reasons. Fanaticism is not a cause of war. It is the means 
            which helps savage peoples to fight.&rdquo;</P>
            <P>He had high praise for the men against whom he himself had ridden 
            into battle at Omdurman, the turning point that won the war for 
            Britain: &ldquo;The valour of their deed has been discounted by those who 
            have told their tale. &lsquo;Mad fanaticism&rsquo; is the depreciating comment 
            of their conquerors. I hold this to be a cruel injustice… . Why 
            should we regard as madness in the savage what would be sublime in 
            civilised men?&rdquo;</P>
            <P>Still, the response to such ferocity had had to be absolute: &ldquo;No 
            terms but fight or death were offered. No reparation or apology 
            could be made… . Civilization—elsewhere sympathetic, merciful, 
            tolerant, ready to discuss or to argue, eager to avoid violence, to 
            submit to law, to effect a compromise—here advanced with an 
            expression of inexorable sternness, and, rejecting all other 
            courses, offered only the arbitrament of the sword.&rdquo;</P>
            <P>Uncannily imagining Britain itself someday facing such an 
            unreasoning aggressor, the man who would rouse his land to defy that 
            aggressor declared, &ldquo;I hope that if evil days should come upon our 
            own country, and the last army which a collapsing Empire could 
            interpose between London and the invader were dissolving in rout and 
            ruin, that there would be some—even in these modern days—who would 
            not care to accustom themselves to a new order of things and tamely 
            survive the disaster.&rdquo;</P>
            <P>The River War, a confident and authoritative telling of a 
            thrilling tale, is available in a new paperback abridgment by 
            Carroll &amp; Graf. </P>
