                  THAT EVERYONE AGREES we are at "war," it is time to think 
                  seriously about what that means. <BR><BR>The usual voices—from 
                  the European Union and its various agents of influence in 
                  America—warn us about the importance of "international 
                  cooperation." Americans who are eager to fight back may be 
                  tempted, on the other hand, to dismiss all talk about the 
                  rights of sovereign states. But now, more than ever, clear 
                  thinking about sovereignty is vital. <BR><BR>The first point 
                  to grasp is that, if we take words seriously, there is no such 
                  thing as "war" against abstractions like "terror"—or "drugs" 
                  or "poverty." War is a relation between sovereign states. The 
                  rest is merely policing—or empty rhetoric. <BR><BR>When armed 
                  men are shooting back, of course, "policing" may have little 
                  to do with lawyerly notions of due process. It can involve any 
                  force required to abate the violence. <BR><BR>Can we police 
                  outside our borders? In the classical conceptions of 
                  international law, sovereign states can deny outside powers 
                  the right to interfere in their own territory: That&rsquo;s what 
                  sovereignty means. But this privilege comes with a price. A 
                  sovereign state is obligated to ensure that its territory is 
                  not used as a launching pad for attacks on the territory of 
                  other states. If the host state won&rsquo;t take action, the victim 
                  state is entitled to do so. <BR><BR>This is not a doctrine 
                  invented in recent times by a starry-eyed U.N. conference. It 
                  follows from the basic idea of sovereignty. One state can only 
                  be expected to respect the territorial integrity of another 
                  when it is safe for it to do so. <BR><BR>So, for example, in 
                  1842, British forces entered American territory from Canada to 
                  seize and destroy a ship loaded with arms for anti-British 
                  rebels in Canada. One American was killed in the resulting 
                  scuffle. Secretary of State Daniel Webster protested that the 
                  British action was precipitate. But he did not deny the 
                  principle that a state is authorized to protect itself when a 
                  neighboring state fails to repress such threats from across 
                  the border. Shortly after our Civil War, Irish nationalists 
                  tried to strike at the British Empire by launching a raid into 
                  Canada from American territory. The United States promptly 
                  apologized, cooperated in rounding up Fenians in New York, and 
                  offered compensation to Britain. <BR><BR>The principle remains 
                  very sound. When a state fails to suppress international 
                  terrorist networks, operating on its own territory, it is 
                  answerable to the countries targeted by the terrorists. A 
                  victim state is then justified when it acts in self-defense 
                  against the host state, even if the host state has indulged 
                  terror networks by negligence or fear rather than deliberate 
                  malice. There can be reasonable dispute about the timing and 
                  degree of defensive action, but not about the principle. 
                  <BR><BR>In planning our responses, we should not expect a 
                  great deal of military assistance from Europe or perhaps from 
                  many other countries. But we should certainly strive to get as 
                  much cooperation from other countries as we can. At minimum, 
                  we will need a lot of cooperation in gathering intelligence 
                  and closing escape routes for terrorist networks. That means 
                  it is much in our interest to keep the focus on terrorism—that 
                  is, on basic security—and not let ourselves get distracted by 
                  pompous rhetoric about democracy, liberty, or human rights. 
                  <BR><BR>China and Pakistan, for example, may prove valuable 
                  partners in some of our efforts. They have reasons of their 
                  own to be fearful of Islamist extremism and international 
                  terror networks. They cannot be expected to join a campaign 
                  for democracy, however, and it is no credit to democracy to 
                  enlist China and Pakistan under its banner. Right now it is 
                  our business to fight international terrorism, not any and all 
                  things of which we may disapprove. In the campaign against 
                  terrorism, pledging respect for the national sovereignty of 
                  our partners can be an asset and should not be seen as a 
                  reluctant concession. <BR><BR>When we do take military action, 
                  however, we must judge for ourselves the appropriateness of 
                  our measures. One thing we must therefore ask of our "allies" 
                  in Europe is that they at least put aside their fantasies of 
                  an international criminal court which would judge the legality 
                  of American actions. <BR><BR>This sort of thing is more than a 
                  distraction. It is a challenge to our own national rights. No 
                  international court can protect us against outside attack. No 
                  international court has any means to seize terrorists or to 
                  force harboring states to surrender them. Now that we have 
                  been attacked, no international court should presume to judge 
                  how we react in defending ourselves. If Europeans want to be 
                  neutral in the coming war, they should at least be told to 
                  respect the classic duty of neutrals—which is to refrain from 
                  judging the belligerents. <BR><BR>To those who regard all this 
                  as anachronistic, we should be more forthright. The terror 
                  menace has reached the scale it now has because too many 
                  countries—including our own—have been too willing to replace 
                  the historic claims of sovereign states with ineffectual and 
                  hypocritical international "understandings." <BR><BR>So the 
                  Palestinian Authority, which is not recognized as a sovereign 
                  state (and does not even claim to be one), is allowed to send 
                  delegates to international forums as if it were. Israel is 
                  told that it cannot interfere in "Palestinian territory," but 
                  the Palestinian Authority is not responsible for terrorist 
                  actions launched from that territory. <BR><BR>What is true for 
                  "Palestine" is true, in greater or lesser degree, for Syria, 
                  Libya, Iraq, and other sponsors of terror. We do not hold them 
                  to the standard of sovereign states. We have allowed them to 
                  connive with international terror, so long as they keep it 
                  below a certain acceptable level—and target it away from 
                  Europe or North America. Now it may be that states that have 
                  sponsored terror at a deniable distance have lost control of 
                  the most fanatic terrorist cells. <BR><BR>But the principle 
                  remains: If states do not suppress international terrorist 
                  operations on their own territory, they are failing in their 
                  most basic obligations. The victims of this failure are 
                  entitled to take up necessary policing duties on their own. Or 
                  they are entitled to regard host state failings as 
                  justification for war—against the sponsoring or negligent 
                  states. The United States now stands in the front rank of the 
                  victim states. And in war, toppling the other side&rsquo;s 
                  government is a time-honored tactic. Let this be clear. 
                  <BR><BR>We may not replace the dictatorships of Saddam Hussein 
                  or Bashar al-Assad with a western-style democracy. But we can 
                  hope to see them replaced with regimes that know the price of 
                  their independence is reliable cooperation in suppressing 
                  terror attacks on outsiders. That is the duty of sovereign 
                  states. That&rsquo;s what we should be fighting for. It is more than 
                  enough. <BR><BR><BR>Jeremy Rabkin teaches international law at
