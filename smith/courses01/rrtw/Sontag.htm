<P align=center>Observations by Susan Sontag</P></FONT></B><FONT face=Arial

<P>The disconnect between last Tuesday's monstrous dose of reality and the 
self-righteous drivel and outright deceptions being peddled by public figures 
and TV commentators is startling, depressing. The voices licensed to follow the 
event seem to have joined together in a campaign to infantilize the public. 
Where is the acknowledgment that this was not a "cowardly" attack on 
"civilization" or "liberty" or "humanity" or "the free world" but an attack on 
the world's self-proclaimed superpower, undertaken as a consequence of specific 
American alliances and actions?&nbsp; How many citizens are aware of the ongoing 
American bombing of Iraq? And if the word "cowardly" is to be used, it might be 
more aptly applied to those who kill from beyond the range of retaliation, high 
in the sky, than to those willing to die themselves in order to kill others. In 
the matter of courage (a morally neutral virtue): whatever may be said of the 
perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.</P>
<P>Our leaders are bent on convincing us that everything is O.K. America is not 
afraid. Our spirit is unbroken, although this was a day that will live in infamy 
and America is now at war. But everything is not O.K. And this was not 
Pearl&nbsp; Harbor. We have a robotic President who assures us that America 
still stands tall. A wide spectrum of public figures, in and out of office, who 
are strongly opposed to the policies being pursued abroad by this Administration 
apparently feel free to say nothing more than that they stand united behind 
President Bush. A lot of thinking needs to be done, and perhaps is being done in 
Washington and elsewhere, about the ineptitude of American intelligence and 
counter-intelligence, about options available to American foreign policy, 
particularly in the Middle East, and about what constitutes a smart program of 
military defense. But the public is not being asked to bear much of the burden 
of reality. The unanimously applauded, self-congratulatory bromides of a Soviet 
Party Congress seemed contemptible. The unanimity of the sanctimonious, 
reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by American officials and media commentators 
in recent days seems, well, unworthy of a mature democracy.</P>
<P>Those in public office have let us know that they consider their task to be a 
manipulative one: confidence-building and grief management. Politics, the 
politics of a democracy—which entails disagreement, which promotes candor—has 
been replaced by psychotherapy. Let's by all means grieve</FONT><FONT size=2> 
</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>together. But let's not be stupid together. A few 
shreds of historical&nbsp;awareness might help us understand what has just 
happened, and what may continue to happen. "Our country is strong," we are told 
again and again. I for one don't find this entirely consoling. Who doubts that 
America is</FONT><FONT size=2> </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>strong? But that's 
not all America has to be.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
