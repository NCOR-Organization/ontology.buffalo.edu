<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%"><I><B>The Evil of Terrorism</B></I></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">The first thing to say about terrorism, and to say 
with all the firmness that one can command, is that it is an evil, a heinous 
crime, an attack on civilized life and on peace. I say this because there has 
been a tendency in some parts of the media and among some commentators, 
including not a few philosophers, to excuse the terrorists who attacked the US 
on September 11<SUP>th</SUP> on the grounds that the US brought these attacks on 
itself by its own foreign policy, and in particular by its policy in the Middle 
East. But however plausible these claims may be (a point I shall return to), we 
should not let them blind us to clear and manifest truths. We must state the 
truth and state it clearly and without hesitation. The attacks on the US were 
evil deeds and those who planned and carried them out were evil men. So much is 
elementary. To doubt this, as some who ought to know better have done, is to 
betray a certain confusion if not corruption of mind. Surely we all know, surely 
we have all known from our earliest youth, that two wrongs do not make a right. 
Let it be, if you will, that the terrorists had grievances, even legitimate 
grievances, against the US. These grievances could never justify their deeds. An 
evil deed can never be justified. An evil deed is precisely that, an evil deed. 
No grievance or pretext, however strong, can ever make it not to be an evil 
deed. Mr. Bin Laden, however, who if not behind the attacks on September 
11<SUP>th</SUP> certainly applauds them, is able to give no other excuse for 
them than random accusations against US policy. But Mr. Bin Laden clearly has a 
corrupt mind. We should not expect better from him.</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I do not mean by these remarks that we should pay no attention to the grievances 
alleged by Mr. Bin Laden and others. Nor do I mean that, because the evil of 
their deeds is so obvious, we should not discuss or explain the evil or say in 
what it consists. On the contrary we should do both, and I will endeavor to do 
both in what follows. What I mean is that, whatever else we say or discuss, at 
no point should we say, or allow others to say without challenge, that 
terrorists attacks are not evil. Their evil is the first and most undeniable 
fact about them. If we are to have any hope of understanding the phenomenon of 
terrorism or of how to deal with it, we must all start there. It is the 
beginning of wisdom. Thankfully, this is not a point on which our political 
leaders have any doubt. For them it is as clear as day that terrorism is an evil 
and an evil of great wickedness. Commentators in the media and some philosophers 
may hesitate and even doubt. But our leaders at least have not lost their grip 
on such basic common sense. As evidence I can do no better in the present 
context than quote the words of the Chinese permanent representative to the 
United Nations: &ldquo;Terrorism, which endangers innocent lives, causes losses of 
social wealth and jeopardizes state security, constitutes a serious challenge to 
human civilization and dignity as well as a serious threat to international 
peace and security&rdquo; (<I>China Daily</I>, Friday, October 5, 2001).</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">But grasping this truth, vital though it be, is 
only the beginning. We must, for the sake of clarity of understanding, carry our 
reflections further. The first step to take in this regard would seem to be to 
lay down some basic definition of terrorism so that we know in universal terms, 
and not just with reference to particular and manifest cases, what it is we are 
talking about. One problem, however, that arises here and that has, I think, 
caused no little confusion, is what has been called state terrorism. Those who 
use this term typically have in mind acts of violence used by governments and 
government forces against parts of their own people or against other peoples. 
The attacks by Israeli forces, for instance, against segments of the Palestinian 
population have sometimes been described as state terrorism, and so have some of 
the actions of the US in Central and South America. Indeed the Taliban have 
themselves described the recent US and British attacks on terrorist camps and 
government buildings in Afghanistan as acts of terrorism.</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I will not comment at present on the justice or injustice of any of these 
attacks. I will only say that, if one wishes to condemn them as wrong, 
understanding is ill served by using the word terrorism to do so. We have other 
words to describe the unjust assaults of governments, among which are tyranny, 
despotism, imperialist aggression, police brutality, and the like. Terrorism, 
however, at least in its primary and typical use (and certainly in its use in 
the phrase &ldquo;the war on terrorism&rdquo;), refers to acts of private individuals or 
groups of private individuals and not to governments, even if these individuals 
receive support and succor from governments. I think we should also distinguish 
terrorism in this its primary sense from the acts, often destructive and 
sometimes wicked too, of rebels and revolutionaries against existing governments 
and peoples. By rebels and revolutionaries we mean typically people who belong 
to the country whose government they are attacking and whose aim is to overthrow 
that government and to replace it with another. As such rebels and 
revolutionaries are not so much a grouping of private individuals as a rival 
government in waiting. But terrorists as typically understood are not a rival 
government nor are they seeking to overthrow the existing government, even if 
they would not be sorry if that happened. The terrorists who attacked the US on 
September 11<SUP>th</SUP>, for instance, were not Americans seeking to overthrow 
the US government and replace it with another one.</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There is something else also that needs to be noted about terrorism if we are to 
be clear about what it is. For the violence of terrorists is typically directed 
at civilians and civilian institutions, albeit civilians of the country against 
which the terrorists have a grievance, and is and is meant to be indiscriminate. 
It is from this feature, indeed, that terrorism gets its name. For such 
indiscriminate and violent acts are designed to cause terror among the people at 
large, and it is by means of such terror that terrorists seek to attain their 
goals and force the hand of governments. Such indiscriminate violence can also 
be a feature of the acts of certain government officials and of certain rebel 
groups. Members of the police force in some parts of the world engage in random 
acts of violence against the civilian population as part of a policy of 
terrorizing the people into subservience. I think in particular of Guatemala. 
Again, some rebel groups, devoted to overthrowing the existing government, may 
also engage in similar acts of random violence against the civilian population. 
I think here of the Basque group ETA and the IRA. Such groups have also, of 
course, engaged in attacks on military installations and personnel, including 
assassination. I would nevertheless want to call these acts of police force and 
rebels acts of terrorism. The members of police forces who engage in random acts 
of violence are doing so clandestinely and when off duty, as it were, even if 
with the connivance and encouragement of their superiors. Were they to do so 
openly and in their capacity as police officers I would say their acts were acts 
of tyranny and government oppression. Again, in the case of ETA and the IRA, I 
would say that their attacks on military installations and government agencies 
could be acts of rebellion (though they need not be) while their attacks on 
civilians would have to be acts of terrorism. This is because attacks on 
civilians cannot be construed as attacks on the existing government so as to 
overthrow it, and hence cannot be construed as attacks by a would-be rival 
government in its capacity as a would-be rival government. They can only be 
construed as attacks by certain persons, who may indeed belong to a group that 
wishes to overthrow the government, but who in this case are operating as 
individuals to sow terror among the population at large. And I would say the 
same was true of attacks on military personnel if the aim here too was to sow 
terror and was not part of an act of defense against or an attack on an armed 
force that was hostile and threatening (so the attack on the USS Cole, for 
instance, would be terrorism and not rebellion).</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But perhaps I need not insist on all these distinctions for my present purposes. 
Let it be sufficient then if we characterize terrorism as acts of violence 
committed by private individuals or groups of individuals, having no political 
authority or pretense of political authority, and directed indiscriminately 
against civilian or at least non-hostile populations and institutions so as to 
spread fear and terror there in order to achieve some limited goal short of the 
immediate overthrow of the existing government. This definition may need some 
further clarification and correction, but I think we are more likely, with its 
help, to get a clearer grasp of the phenomenon of terrorism as we ordinarily 
speak of terrorism, and certainly as we are speaking of terrorism in the present 
context of the war on terrorism. [Other phenomena, which may be close to it but 
are not really part of it, such as what is called state terrorism, can thus be 
set aside&mdash;not indeed so as to be ignored, but so as to be dealt with more 
clearly in their own place and in their own terms.]</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
At all events, with this definition of terrorism, we can see at once why 
terrorism is and must be evil and unjust. Note first that the evil and injustice 
of terrorism is not part of the definition of terrorism. I have not defined 
terrorism as unjust or evil acts of violence. I have defined it by reference to 
certain acts of violence, to be sure, but without mention of good or bad. The 
injustice of terrorism does, nevertheless, immediately follow from this 
definition when we add to it the further proposition that deliberate and 
intentional attacks on the innocent are unjust. That it is unjust to attack the 
innocent is something of a self-evident proposition. Justice is fundamentally a 
matter of giving each their due, but the deliberate infliction of harm or injury 
is not due to the innocent who, precisely as innocent, are owed peace and 
protection, not violence. That civilian populations and also non-hostile 
military personnel, who are the objects of terrorist attacks, are innocent in 
this sense is also obvious. This is not to say that all those who suffer in 
terrorist attacks are innocent of every crime whatever. Some might indeed happen 
to be criminals. But it is to say that they are innocent in the precise respect 
in which they are attacked. For they are attacked simply in their capacity as 
civilians or non-hostile military going about their ordinary tasks (a warship in 
a friendly port, for instance, is not a hostile presence about to inflict death 
or injury). Such tasks are not attacks or threats against anyone, least of all 
against the terrorists. They cannot, taken precisely as such, be construed as in 
any way deserving of attack or injury or death. They are innocent tasks. But it 
is against people engaged in such innocent tasks that terrorists launch their 
attacks. Terrorist attacks are therefore attacks on innocents and so cannot be 
anything but evil and unjust.</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It matters not here what grievances the terrorists may have or what accusations 
they level against those countries whose people they attack. An evil deed is an 
evil deed and nothing can make it to be a good deed. Not even religion, not even 
the Muslim religion, can make it to be a good deed. Those who say it can, or who 
claim the support of Islam for their terrorist attacks (as we know from private 
letters that the hijackers did on September 11<SUP>th</SUP>), are simply abusing 
religion and Islam. Do not take my argument alone for this. Take rather the 
words of one of the Taliban themselves, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, who 
said of the attack on the US: &ldquo;This action is terrorist action. We know this was 
not Islamic and was a very dangerous action, and we condemn that&rdquo; (<I>China 
Daily</I>, Thursday, October 4, 2001). Mr. Bin Laden has, of course, said the 
exact opposite. He has praised the attacks on the US and on civilians, and said 
that Islam expressly requires Muslims to engage in such attacks. But if even the 
Taliban deny that this is what Islam teaches, one wonders what sort of Islam Mr. 
Bin Laden is following or whether he is really following Islam at all rather 
than his own corrupt inventions. At all events decent Muslims have good reason 
to repudiate, and to repudiate openly and loudly, the Islam preached by Mr. Bin 
Laden. We can be grateful, therefore, to those Islamic countries that have done 
so, among whom Saudi Arabia should be mentioned. Saudi Arabia severed relations 
with the Taliban on the grounds that the Taliban had brought Islam into 
disrepute which, with their support for Mr. Bin Laden, must, even by the 
Taliban&rsquo;s own admission, be true.</P>

</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%"><I><B>Responding to the Evil of 
Terrorism</B></I></P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Terrorism then is an evil, and an evil of a 
particularly vicious kind which constitutes, as the Chinese permanent 
representative to the UN said, &ldquo;a serious challenge to human civilization and 
dignity as well as a serious threat to international peace and security.&rdquo; Those 
countries, therefore, which love peace and care for the good of mankind must do 
something to rid the world of this evil. Not to do so would be a dereliction of 
duty. It is everyone&rsquo;s duty to do good (pursuing good and avoiding evil is an 
elementary injunction of reason), and among the good things to be done is the 
removal of evils, especially grave evils&mdash;to the extent, at any rate, that this 
is possible. Here, however, we must be careful, for in opposing evil it is all 
too easy to fall into evil oneself. We are all doubtless aware, even from our 
youth, of how easy it is, when someone has injured or insulted us, to respond 
with hatred and fury and to inflict, or try to inflict, worse injury than we 
first suffered. We may in this way satisfy our lust for revenge but we do not in 
this way remove evil or make the world a better place. On the contrary we simply 
add to the evil in the world, for we add our own evil to the evil of the other. 
One cannot defeat evil with evil. That is simply contradictory. To use evil 
against evil is not to defeat evil but to be defeated by it and to become evil, 
or even more evil, in one&rsquo;s own turn. This is a truth that Mr. Bin Laden has 
altogether failed to grasp. But we, who profess to be opposing Mr. Bin Laden and 
his ilk, must not sink to his level. We must not become terrorists and mass 
murderers ourselves. For we cannot on the one hand condemn terrorism and set out 
to destroy it, while on the other hand commit acts of terrorism of our own. As I 
have already said, two wrongs do not make a right and evil cannot be defeated by 
evil. Only right can make a right, and only good can defeat evil.</P>
<P 
style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Now it is a striking fact that in all the build-up to the war on terrorism, 
beginning from President Bush&rsquo;s first declaration immediately after September 
11<SUP>th</SUP>, there have been repeated and persistent declarations from all 
sides that the war should be conducted with great prudence and caution, that it 
should only target the guilty, that it should not result in collateral damage or 
as little such damage as possible, and so forth. These declarations came first 
from the American Government itself. They were then repeated by almost all 
countries round the world, whether friendly or hostile to the US. The hostile 
countries, among which we should particularly mention Taliban-controlled 
Afghanistan, made these declarations with a certain indignation and even with 
fear (springing, perhaps, from secret guilt). But it is a tribute to the US that 
they made these declarations at all. The declarations were an admission that it 
made sense to appeal to justice when talking to the US; that one could 
reasonably expect the US to be sensitive to the claims of justice when deciding 
what to do; that one had some hope, indeed, of getting the US to change its mind 
if its policies could be shown not to accord with justice. I do not mean to 
imply by this that the US always acts with justice, that none of its policies 
has been unjust, or that none of its officers has behaved unjustly. That would 
be too much to expect of any country or government. We are human, all too human. 
We make mistakes, sometimes deliberately. We regret only after the event and not 
before. But at least we can regret; at least we can acknowledge the claims of 
justice against us; at least we can be restrained by appeals to what is good. 
Certainly the world, including the Taliban, think that is true of the US, for 
otherwise why make appeals to justice? </P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">But consider the contrast here. Has the world 
thought it worth appealing to justice with the Taliban or with Mr. Bin Laden? 
Has the world beaten a path to Mr. Bin Laden&rsquo;s door appealing to him to follow 
justice and prudence in his decisions of who and what to attack? Has the world 
appealed to him, in the name of justice, to give himself up to a court of law to 
prove his innocence or to admit his guilt? Some appeal was indeed made to the 
Taliban in the name of justice to hand Mr. Bin Laden over, but we know how 
little regard they paid to that appeal. Again, to change focus slightly, has 
anyone appealed to Mr. Saddam Hussein in the name of justice to stop the tyranny 
and oppression of his people, to abide by UN resolutions, to apologize and make 
reparation for his aggression against Iran and Kuwait? To my knowledge this has 
not happened, at least not on the same scale as appeals to justice have been 
made in the case of the US and the war on terrorism. But why the difference? 
Surely because no one believes that Mr. Bin Laden, the Taliban, Mr. Saddam 
Hussein have a sufficient sense of justice to make such appeals worthwhile. We 
have all learned that these people are too far gone in evil to be sensitive to 
the principles of good. Only force could bring home to them the error of their 
ways and there is no guarantee of success even then. Let us, therefore, give 
tribute and blame where tribute and blame are due: tribute to the US because we 
all see that the US has not lost its sensitivity to justice, blame to Mr. Bin 
Laden and the Taliban and Mr. Saddam Hussein because we all see that they 
have.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Let it be agreed then that we must resist evil and 
resist it with good. Our particular question, however, concerns the evil of 
terrorism and how to resist it with good. The short answer is that we should 
resist it with all the good at our command. In all our actions, in all our 
lives, we should be doing the most good we can and encouraging our neighbors to 
do the same. For the evil of terrorism springs from many sources, and in 
particular it springs from the injustices, real or apparent, committed by others 
against what the terrorists hold dear. Such injustices give no excuse, of 
course, to the evil deeds of terrorists as I have already several times 
remarked, but if we can, each in our own way and in our own place, reduce the 
injustice around us, we will be doing our part to reduce the emergence of more 
terrorists in the future, as well as making the world a better place in general. 
But such an answer, while vital and in need of frequent repetition, is not 
enough. Our concern is the more specific question of whether force, in 
particular the force of war, is a just response to terrorism. If it is not we 
ought not to engage in it; but if it is we need to know what sort of force, 
under what conditions, subject to what limits, and so forth.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">The first thing to note here is that force is a 
neutral term. It does not by itself connote something either good or bad. The 
same is true, for instance, of tolerance. That too connotes something neither 
good nor bad in itself. Everything depends on what is tolerated and why. 
Tolerating the murder of infants would clearly be bad; tolerating the expression 
of different opinions in the course of philosophical debate would clearly be 
good. That is why those who praise tolerance as a virtue are speaking too 
simply. Tolerance as such is not a virtue, nor is intolerance as such a vice. We 
need to know tolerance or intolerance of what, by whom, when, how. That is also 
why those who condemn force as a vice, such as pacifists, are speaking too 
simply as well. Is all use of force always and everywhere wrong? Is the force 
used by parents to discipline children wrong? Is the force used by police forces 
to arrest criminals wrong? Is the force used to defend oneself against attackers 
wrong? It seems patent that to answer yes to all these questions is absurd. Some 
uses of force are clearly right and just. The only interesting question to ask 
is which uses are so.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Since force is in itself neutral, it can only be 
just or unjust according to the way it is used, that is say for what goals or 
ends, in what amount or kind, against and by whom, when and where, with what 
likely consequences, and so forth. Of these several features, the goal or end of 
force would seem to be the first and most important. No amount of force, used by 
anyone on any occasion, could be just if the end aimed at were not just. So what 
are the just aims for which force may be used? Well ultimately, since we are 
talking of the use of force by men against men, the goals must be the good of 
men. Only if force has as its goal the promotion of the human good could it be 
good. The human good is clearly a complex whole consisting of many parts, from 
material and physical goods, to external goods, to cultural, educational, and 
spiritual goods. There is no need to spell these out in detail or explain their 
connections and relative subordination to each other. It is enough to note them 
in their general outline. For our concern is less about what the human good is 
than about what uses of force are justified with relation to it. In particular, 
since the war on terrorism is directed against resisting an evil, the evil of 
attacks on innocent life and limb, on habitations and property, on economic and 
social structures, the question is what determines the legitimate use of force 
in resistance to evil.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">The operative idea here is clearly that of 
self-defense. Since the human good is the object of pursuit, whatever attacks 
that good or hinders that pursuit may be resisted and repulsed sufficiently to 
make the pursuit of the good possible again. Suppose, however, that force is the 
only, or only reasonable, way to preserve and promote the good. Are we justified 
in having recourse to it? The answer would seem to be an unambiguous yes in the 
case of ordinary criminals who threaten us from within our own communities. One 
could hardly conceive of a community, at least a decent community, that did not 
protect itself and its members, using force if need be, against such criminal 
activities. Since such activities serve to undermine any community and threaten 
its viability, and the more so the more they are left to grow unchecked, a 
community that does not undertake to defend itself against them has, to all 
intents and purposes, given up the desire to survive as a community at all. By 
parity of reasoning, the same should hold in the case of enemies and terrorists 
who attack the community from without and in more violent and destructive ways. 
In other words, the justification for armies and wars is of the same sort as the 
justification for policemen and prisons.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">There is, however, a paradox here, a paradox that 
lends considerable support to the case of pacifists. For any use of force seems 
always to be an attack on the good as well as a defense of it. Policemen have 
sometimes lost their lives in the attempt to arrest criminals by force and their 
families and friends have suffered all the grief of bereavement as a result. If 
such harm arises in these cases, how much more does it do so in time of war? Not 
only are more people maimed and killed in war (and in more awful ways), and more 
families tortured with grief, but the potential loss of civilian life, the 
destruction of property, the suspension of peacetime activities, the disruption 
of the economy and so forth make the damage to the human good so great as to 
render war unacceptable.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">This paradox admits of an answer and an answer that 
points to the true place of force in human affairs, namely that it is a last 
resort, to be undertaken reluctantly and only because no other reasonable course 
of action is available. A situation where force is necessary is something 
regrettable, which one would avoid if possible, because it is a situation where 
one is unable to preserve all the goods one would wish to preserve. Some have to 
be sacrificed for the sake of others more important. That it is right to 
sacrifice some goods for the sake of others when harsh fate compels such a 
choice would be conceded by most of us, because it is conceded by most of us in 
many other cases besides war and the use of force. We consider it right to 
amputate a diseased limb to save the whole body or to cast overboard precious 
cargo to save the ship from sinking. One must look at the war on terrorism in 
the same way. Regrettable though it is, it is yet the only sensible way forward 
in some circumstances.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Force, then, is necessary for the pursuit of the 
good, but only as a last resort and only as long as force is necessary. As soon 
as it becomes possible to pursue the good again without recourse to the use of 
force we should do so. Now it is clear that in the case of the current war 
against terrorism the US and its allies are following the logic of this 
argument. Before any force was used as many appeals were made as possible and 
through as many channels as possible to get the Taliban to give up the 
terrorists within their midst and to close down the camps where these terrorists 
trained. The Taliban have refused and since the terrorists have also refused to 
give themselves up voluntarily both groups have effectively declared themselves 
at war with the civilized world. For any part of the civilized world is a 
potential object of their attacks. The civilized world, therefore, has been 
driven by them into the last resort of using force against them. </P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">A clarification is needed at this point, however, 
because of certain confusions that have appeared in the media. The use of force 
is sanctioned under the idea of self-defense. It is because the pursuit of the 
good requires us to defend ourselves against attack that we are permitted, in 
extreme cases and as a last resort, to use force. But acts of self-defense, even 
acts that are themselves attacks on offending countries, are not as such acts of 
retaliation or revenge (contrary to what some of the media have implied). In 
fact, self-defense cannot and does not justify retaliation or revenge. It 
justifies only self-defense. Once sufficient force has been used to secure such 
defense there can be no justification for further use of force. To continue 
force beyond that point would be to engage in unjust aggression oneself and so 
to become guilty of&nbsp; the injustice that one was condemning in one&rsquo;s enemy. 
As has been said before, one cannot defeat evil with evil. Retaliation and 
revenge, however, clearly go beyond the requirements of self-defense and even 
if, in a given case, they do not, they cannot be justified by appeal to the 
human good. Retaliation and revenge are the infliction on another of suffering 
and loss because he has first inflicted suffering and loss on us. Such 
retaliation and revenge may simply consist in making the other suffer as much as 
he made us suffer, but more often than not the lust for revenge makes us inflict 
more suffering than we suffered. But how does the infliction of such suffering 
help us to defend ourselves against attack or help us to continue the pursuit of 
the good without fear and in peace? Take the concrete case of the attacks on New 
York. Over 6,000 people were killed in those attacks and billions of dollars 
worth of damage was caused. Are we to continue attacks on terrorists in 
Afghanistan until we have killed over 6,000 of them and until we have inflicted 
on them billions of dollars worth of damage? The very thought is ridiculous. 
Apart from the fact that there are probably not 6,000 terrorists in Afghanistan 
and that the country is too desperately poor to have assets totaling billions of 
dollars, the idea that inflicting such damage is the only way to defend 
ourselves against terrorist attacks only needs to be stated to be dismissed.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">No, the war on terrorism cannot be about revenge; 
it is about self-defense. This point has been made very clear by the US and 
allied governments, and indeed by civilized governments all over the world, 
including China. Indeed the way the war is being talked about, the way everyone 
has insisted that only the guilty be pursued and only those countries that 
support them attacked, that collateral damage be kept to an absolute minimum, 
all demonstrate this fact. Of course, we must all remain vigilant that this goal 
is not in any way perverted. But such vigilance has been made all the easier by 
the fact that the US and its allies have tried to get the whole civilized world 
behind the war on terrorism. We may be sure that many countries will be watching 
the war with care and will not be slow to protest if it oversteps its stated 
limits. At the present time Pakistan is clearly exercising such vigilance and we 
can be fairly confident that the concerns of Pakistan are being carefully 
listened to and that they are having their effect on the conduct of attacks on 
Afghanistan. If the attacks have to be extended further afield we can be equally 
sure that other countries will exercise similar vigilance.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">This vigilance must concern not only the aim of the 
war&mdash;defense against terrorist attacks&mdash;but the means used to achieve it and their 
likely effects. For clearly the means must be measured by the goal and must not 
exceed it. Once defense has been secured, say by destruction of terrorist 
training camps and safe havens, and once the power of the Taliban in particular 
to support and foster terrorism has been destroyed, there is no need to continue 
the attacks. Any such continuation would not fall under the needs of defense but 
under revenge or retaliation or something of the sort and so would clearly be 
unjust. Further, if the attacks, despite not fully achieving their aim, start 
becoming counterproductive and cause more damage, especially collateral damage, 
than they are meant to cure, then they should cease. The war is justified by 
self defense which is justified by the human good. But if the war starts causing 
more damage to that good than it could possibly remove, it has itself become an 
attack on the good and not a defense of it.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">So much should, I think, be sufficient to show the 
basic justice of the war on terrorism and what its goals are and what its limits 
should be. There remains only the question of whether and to what extent the US 
may have brought terrorist attacks on itself by its own misguided policies. The 
policies in question, if we go by the remarks of Mr. Bin Laden himself, are the 
keeping of US troops in Saudi Arabia and US support for Israel. As regards the 
former, one can hardly see what the problem is, especially since US forces are 
there at the invitation and pleasure of the Saudis. If Mr. Bin Laden wants the 
US forces gone then he only has to persuade the Saudis to withdraw the 
invitation. Why has he not done that or why has he not taken his complaint, and 
his terrorism, to Saudi Arabia? Actually Mr. Bin Laden wants the US forces gone 
because they are infidels in the land of the Prophet. But why do the Saudis, who 
are the protectors of that land and of the holy places of Islam, not agree with 
him? Is Mr. Bin Laden the only true interpreter of what is and is not tolerable 
to Islam? Must all Muslims bow to Mr. Bin Laden&rsquo;s authority or else face his 
terrorist wrath? It is beginning to look as if Mr. Bin Laden is more your 
typical tyrant than your typical Muslim. At all events we may dismiss this 
complaint of his as frivolous. The presence of US forces in Saudi Arabia is not 
unjust and not un-Islamic, whatever Mr. Bin Laden may say.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">As regards the other complaint, US support of 
Israel, it is again difficult to see what the problem is. That Israel has the 
right to exist, and therefore also the right of self-defense, is conceded by the 
whole civilized world, including the Arab world, and is expressly guaranteed by 
UN resolutions. Even the Palestinians under Mr. Arafat concede this. Now some 
Arabs of course do not concede it, including the terrorist organization Hamas 
and including Mr. Bin Laden. But then Mr. Bin Laden has set himself, not only 
against the whole civilized world, but against the whole Arab world. Must the 
Arab world again bow down to him and follow only his judgment about what Muslims 
should believe and do about the state of Israel? Is Mr. Bin Laden the new 
prophet, the new voice of God?</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">We may dismiss this complaint then as frivolous 
too. US support for the existence and defense of the state of Israel is only 
what the whole civilized world concedes. We may, however, raise another point 
which no doubt lies behind Mr. Bin Laden&rsquo;s anger as it also lies behind the 
worries of many Arabs and Arab states. I mean, not the right of Israel to exist 
and defend itself, but the particular acts that Israel carries out in the name 
of self-defense. I have in mind the periodic incursions of Israeli military into 
Palestinian areas, the destruction of property, the resulting deaths of 
Palestinian protesters, the targeted killings, or assassinations, of specific 
individuals. The first thing to note here is that the US has itself been at the 
forefront of those criticizing and condemning Israel for these kinds of attacks. 
Israel certainly has the right to defend itself, particularly against the 
frequent terrorist attacks within Israeli territory, but not the right to go 
beyond that. I am inclined to think, in fact, that Israel has fallen into the 
error of confusing retaliation with self-defense. As I said earlier, the two are 
not the same and the second does not justify the first. Yet Israel typically 
describes its incursions into Palestinian areas as reprisals and these 
incursions also typically come after some terrorist attack. Such incursions 
cannot be justified, or they cannot be justified like this. They, or some of 
them, could, however, be justified as acts of self-defense, but only if they 
take that form. For instance, the terrorist attacks on Israel are planned and 
carried out by terrorist groups, such as Hamas, that deny the right of Israel to 
exist. They do not come from the PLO, the organization headed by Mr. Arafat. 
What Israel may legitimately do, therefore, is to go after Hamas, arrest their 
personnel and destroy their training camps and weapons (not unlike, indeed, what 
the US is trying to do in Afghanistan). This might require incursions into 
Palestinian territory of a greater nature than Israel currently undertakes for 
acts of reprisal. Moreover such acts could be done in concert with the PLO. 
Indeed the PLO is itself partly to blame here. It should be their responsibility 
to suppress terrorism within their territory, as Israel has often and 
legitimately complained. But the PLO are seemingly incapable of doing so. Since 
the PLO agree that Israel has a right to exist, that Hamas and similar 
organizations are wrong and engaged in acts of terrorism, why do they not call 
upon Israeli help to rid Palestine of such people? Israeli fire power and PLO 
intelligence should together be enough to do the job. Palestine is not a big 
place. There are not many places for terrorists to hide.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">Well, that is one suggestion. Perhaps it is a good 
one, perhaps it is not. I do not know enough, I&rsquo;m afraid, to be able to judge. 
But what I can and will say is that the US cannot in any sense be blamed for its 
policy in the Middle East. The US is upholding, in a way that few other 
countries have been willing to do, the basic right of Israel to exist. That is 
an important, necessary, and fundamentally just act. The US has nevertheless 
recognized the right of the Palestinians to a homeland and to a peaceful 
homeland. Indeed the US has recently recognized the desirability of there being 
an independent Palestinian state. The US has also condemned many Israeli acts of 
reprisal, particularly the targeted killings or assassinations. Moreover the US 
has tried time out of number to broker a workable peace in Israel. The Camp 
David accords, which secured the basic peace between Israel and her Arab 
neighbors, go back to the presidency of Jimmy Carter in the late 70s. Every 
president since has tried to build on those accords and bring final peace to a 
troubled land. That success has still not been reached cannot, I think, be put 
down to lack of will on the part of the US. I don&rsquo;t think, therefore, that US 
policy in the Middle East can be blamed in any fundamental way. Perhaps mistakes 
have been made, but if so they are the mistakes to which human nature is only 
too prone. They do not spring from malice, or hatred of Islam, or indifference 
to Palestinian rights. In short, a fair minded assessment of US policy cannot, I 
think, accuse it of being a cause of terrorist attacks. Terrorists may allege US 
policy as a cause but then it is they who are at fault for having an unjust 
approach to the Israeli question in the first place. They want Israel to cease 
to exist and that can in no way be conceded to them, as the whole civilized 
world, including the Arab world, agrees.</P>
<P style="LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">In short, whatever were the motives that drove the 
terrorists to their attacks on the US, the blame cannot be put on the US. The 
terrorists and they alone must bear the responsibility for their 
deeds.</P></BODY></HTML>
