            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The 
            events of 11 September elicited responses of surprise, shock and 
            horror, and, as those who planned them hoped, of terror. 
            Momentarily, these responses blotted out judgment. But very quickly 
            those in government and the people at large in the United States 
            made a judgment about what happened. When they did, their judgment 
            tended to be automatic or intuitive in nature. What happened was 
            felt to be so obviously wrong that little or no thought was 
            required. Wrong is wrong, and that is the end of the matter. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>But 
            there are reasons for going beyond our intuitions when making moral 
            judgments. The first is that intuitive judgments aren't always 
            trustworthy. What seems wrong right away might turn out to be less 
            wrong or perhaps more wrong, or not wrong at all, upon reflection. 
            The second reason is that although you and I might be convinced 
            intuitively that what happened on 11 September is very wrong, others 
            might not be. Many in Europe, Asia and Africa did not respond to the 
            attacks in the negative way most Americans did. Some reflection 
            might, then, be useful by way of helping others better understand 
            the significance of what happened. Third, reflection on 11 September 
            can also be useful in suggesting how the US and its allies should 
            respond to these events. Reflection might very well suggest that one 
            way of responding is more or less appropriate than another. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>But 
            how should the process of reflection proceed? Fortunately, there is 
            a tradition of thinking about war and war-like events that can help. 
            It is called Just War Theory. This theory evolved in various 
            cultures throughout the world, including Islam, to guide people in 
            their thinking about the horrors of war. Although the theory is not 
            universally accepted, it is recognised widely enough to have 
            credibility as a tool for helping rulers and citizens alike to think 
            more clearly about the ethics of war. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The 
            theory has two parts. The first deals with the right and wrong of 
            getting involved in war (i.e., the justice of the war or <I>jus ad 
            bellum</I>) and the second with the right and wrong of actually 
            fighting in a war once it starts (justice in war or <I>jus in 
            bello</I>). Both parts of the theory establish standards of conduct 
            that must be reached in order to be involved in war justly. These 
            standards can be thought of as hurdles over which a nation or some 
            group must jump before it can say that it is rightly involved in 
            war. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>There 
            are six hurdles on the justice-of-the-war side. The most important 
            is called the Just Cause Principle. This principle says that there 
            must be a good reason for going to war. One such reason is that a 
            nation or group is, or has recently been, under attack by an 
            aggressor. Another is that a friendly nation is, or has recently 
            been, under attack. Still another is that a large number of people 
            are being slaughtered. A related reason is that some catastrophe 
            such as a famine has befallen a people, and the government in charge 
            is incapable of doing anything about it. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The 
            second hurdle or standard to be met is the Legitimate Authority 
            Principle. To be just, a war must be started by those leaders in 
            government or the group who are authorised to do so, and not by some 
            maverick general, wild-eyed politician, some private association or 
            group, etc. The third hurdle is the Good Intentions Principle. This 
            can mean many things but recently it has come to mean that the 
            nation or group contemplating war will act on the basis of the Just 
            Cause Principle. Thus if a nation goes to war to help an ally, it 
            should act accordingly and not take advantage of the situation by 
            occupying or exploiting the ally. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The 
            fourth hurdle is the Likelihood of Success Principle. This principle 
            simply says that if there is little or no likelihood of succeeding 
            in a military venture, war should not be started. If no good can 
            come from war, it should not be chosen because war is such a 
            horrible option. A related principle is called Proportionality. This 
            principle says that if there is a strong likelihood that going to 
            war will do much more harm than good, then entering war is wrong. 
            The sixth principle is called Last Resort. This principle makes the 
            reasonable assumption that war brings so much pain and suffering to 
            many people that nations or groups should not enter into it quickly. 
            Instead, all means short of war should be tried before war or some 
            war-like activity is chosen. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The 
            second part of Just War Theory usually takes the form of two 
            principles. The first is Proportionality, once again, only now the 
            principle is taken as applying not to the whole of war but to 
            individual battles or campaigns within war. There are difficulties 
            when it comes to applying this principle. But, roughly, it tells a 
            commander not to choose those options that are likely to cause 
            excessive casualties (to any and all the participants). For example, 
            when taking a hill, a less costly indirect assault might very well 
            be preferred over a direct one. The second principle is called 
            Discrimination. This principle tells those in charge to aim at 
            certain people and objects (such as soldiers, airports and military 
            supply trains) and not other people and objects (such as civilians, 
            hospitals and schools). </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>One of 
            the key ideas in applying Just War Theory is that each and every 
            Justice-of-the-War principle has to be satisfied before a nation or 
            group can be said to be justly involved in war. A nation could claim 
            that it is justified in going to war since Just Cause, Proper 
            Authorization, Good Intentions, Likelihood of Success and the 
            Proportionality Principle are all on its side. Still, if it entered 
            the war as a first resort, its claim to acting justly fails. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
            size=-1>Another key idea in applying the theory is that the two 
            parts must be judged separately. Thus even if a group satisfied all 
            the Justice-of-the-War principles, it would still be acting unjustly 
            if it violated the Principle of Discrimination in the war by killing 
            civilians indiscriminately. Conversely, a nation could enter a war 
            for unjust reasons (by not satisfying one or more of the six 
            principles) and yet, fight a clean war once it started. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>In 
            terms of this Just War Theory, what can be said about what happened 
            on 11 September, 2001? Before answering that question we need an 
            account, a brief one, of what actually happened. Four commercial 
            airliners were commandeered by a total of 19 or 20 men. After taking 
            control of the planes, three were deliberately crashed into 
            buildings. These events were reminiscent of the Kamikaze attacks of 
            World War II. Two of the planes hit the World Trade Center main 
            buildings, and one hit the Pentagon. The fourth plane evidently did 
            not reach its target - possibly the White House. About 6,000 people 
            were killed. Most of the dead were in the World Trade Center. 
            However, many died in the Pentagon and, of course, all the attackers 
            as well as all the passengers in the four planes also died. The 
            attacks were unanticipated, unannounced, unacknowledged and, 
            evidently, well coordinated. Other attacks may have been planned, 
            but for one reason or another not carried out. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>There 
            are serious problems in applying Just War Theory to these events, 
            not the least of which is that the attackers are not identifiable as 
            acting on behalf of a nation state. Under the cir cumstances it is 
            not clear, for example, how the Principle of Legitimate Authority in 
            the theory should be applied. What sense of legitimacy can those who 
            led the attackers claim to have? The application of the Likelihood 
            of Success Principle is also in doubt. How does anyone assess the 
            meaning of success in these kinds of situations and how are the 
            chances of success to be computed, especially when the goals of the 
            attackers are not well understood? Still, as we will see, enough of 
            the theory remains in place so it can be used to assess the justice 
            of the attackers' actions. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
            size=-1>Certainly the Just Cause Principle is still in place. Even 
            if the attacks are viewed not as war, but as major criminal acts, it 
            can still be asked whether what was done was justified. Did the 
            attackers have one or more just cause for acting as they did? Well, 
            the attacking groups were not themselves under direct military 
            attack; nor were the countries that they appointed themselves to 
            represent. From their perspective they may have had strong 
            grievances against the United States. With all its power, America 
            can no doubt be viewed as an intrusive nation economically, 
            politically and culturally. In so far as it is, the claim could be 
            made that US policies and actions 'corrupt' and 'defile' the nations 
            of Islam. Beyond that, it could even be said that the US actually 
            threatens Islam. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>But 
            such a threat, if that is what it is, is surely not an act of war. 
            No Islamic nation was being invaded and destroyed by the US prior to 
            11 September. And no Islamic nation is so helpless that it cannot 
            resist the American intrusions. So this line of thinking hardly 
            constitutes a just cause for starting a war or war-like activities 
            that lead to large-scale death and destruction. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
            size=-1>However, another line of thinking more plausibly gives the 
            attackers a just cause. They could claim that they and the countries 
            they represent are at war with Israel and that the US was and is 
            giving direct military aid in the form of equipment and intelligence 
            to that country. They could then argue: "A friend of my enemy is my 
            enemy." This is the same argument that some officials in the US 
            government have been using. They have been saying that the US has a 
            right to attack any nation that directly supported the 11 September 
            attackers or might support future attackers. A friend of my enemy is 
            indeed my enemy. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>But, 
            now, did the 11 September attackers satisfy the other conditions of 
            philosophy after 11 September just war theory? One could concede 
            that they had just cause but still argue that they failed to satisfy 
            the other conditions of the theory. Recall that the attackers need 
            to satisfy all the conditions of the Justice-of-the-War portion of 
            the theory before their actions are fully justified. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>As we 
            have seen already, most of these criteria are difficult to apply to 
            the 11 September events. However, the Last Resort still finds 
            application. This criterion says that efforts need to be made to 
            avoid war before going to war. Negotiations must be tried, warnings 
            issued, deadlines set, etc. before weapons are employed to settle a 
            dispute. For the attackers, this not only means applying the Last 
            Resort Principle to the US, but also to the nations they claim to 
            represent. Thus before attacking anyone, the Last Resort Principle 
            burdens the attackers to have made serious attempts to convince 
            their own governments to change their ways. For example, they could 
            have tried to convince Saudi Arabia to ask the US forces to leave 
            since they are supposedly 'despoiling' the holiest of the holy lands 
            of Islam. The Last Resort Principle burdens them as well to appeal 
            directly to the US government to adopt a withdrawal policy with 
            regard to Saudi Arabia and, also, other Islamic nations. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
            size=-1>Evidence might appear in the future to indicate that the 
            attackers attempted to apply the Last Resort Principle in these 
            ways. But from what we know now, it appears that they did not take 
            this principle seriously. Their attempts to bring about US 
            withdrawal, and to convince the US not to support Israel were 
            half-hearted. They, therefore, on this count alone, failed to meet 
            the standards of the Justice-of-the-War portion of Just War Theory. 
            Their actions were more akin to following a policy of first, rather 
            than last, resort. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
            size=-1>Matters get worse for the attackers when we move to the 
            Justice-in-the-War portion of Just War Theory. As it turns out, one 
            of the two principles in this portion of the theory is more relevant 
            to the 11 September events than the other. In this case the relevant 
            principle is Discrimination. Notice the double violation of this 
            principle in the attack on the World Trade Center in New York. The 
            airliners that hit the two buildings were full of civilians who had 
            no truck with the military. They were sacrificed, along with the 
            attackers, as the planes were crashed into the towers. But thou 
            sands of civilians working in the towers were also sacrificed. No 
            doubt, then, these acts represent gross violations of the 
            Discrimination Principle. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>In 
            this respect, the attack on the Pentagon was not as morally 
            despicable as the attack on the twin-towers. It was bad enough. 
            Although the Pentagon represents a paradigm case of a military 
            target, the attack is still unjust since it represents a surprise 
            attack (i.e., a violation of the Last Resort Principle). It also, of 
            course, is unjust with respect to the Discrimination Principle 
            since, again, civilians on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon 
            were sacrificed. Had the fourth plane hit the White House it would 
            have had to be assessed in a similar fashion. Although the White 
            House is not a pure military target, enough military planning takes 
            place there so as to make it a legitimate target. But had the White 
            House been destroyed (along with many high officials), the Last 
            Resort Principle would not have been honored. Nor, once again, would 
            the Principle of Discrimination have been honoured since the 
            civilians on the plane would have been sacrificed. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>There 
            are, then, ample reasons for saying that the attacks of 11 September 
            were unjust. They were grossly unjust. But, now, what of the justice 
            of a response to these attacks? Briefly this much can be said. The 
            US has Just Cause on its side. It was attacked, many people died, 
            great economic damage was done to the nation and the emotions of 
            Americans were set on edge. What about Last Resort? In one sense the 
            principle has no application for the US. Last Resort is designed to 
            prevent violence. But violence had already been perpetrated. Still, 
            the US could, and should, ask itself whether it has done (or is 
            doing) everything it can to avoid a violent response to violence. 
            The answer seems to be "Yes". The US had taken steps to warn those 
            who helped the attackers that they should expect arrest. Failing 
            that, they should expect to be attacked. The US also warned those 
            nations that harboured the attacking team that they should take 
            steps to keep attacks like those of 11 September from happening 
            again. It has also applied, or is applying, economic and political 
            pressure on those who are associated with the attackers. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>What 
            about the other Justice of the War principles? There is no doubt 
            that the actions the US and its allies are planning are properly 
            authorised. The US president, for instance, sought approval for what 
            might be done from Congress, from other countries and from the 
            United Nations. As to the Likelihood of Success Principle this much 
            can be said. There is a good likelihood that the attackers will be 
            harmed in a significant way if they are subjected to concerted 
            military, political and economic pressure. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>As to 
            the Proportionality Principle, attempts to harm those who supported 
            the attackers will be costly in lives and money. But presumably the 
            overall good in the form of fewer attacks in the future will 
            override this harm. What about the Good Intentions Principle? 
            Actually, this principle and the Discrimination Principle run in 
            parallel at this point. If the US and its allies mount attacks on 
            those who helped the attackers and/or on clearly identifiable 
            potential attackers, then both principles will be honoured. </FONT>
            <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=-1>The 
            danger is that the response might not be precise enough. It is 
            pretty clear that the vast majority of people in the various nations 
            where attackers train (such as Afghanistan) have nothing to do with 
            these attackers. Thus Just War Theory would condemn a response that 
            indiscriminately harmed the innocent. Actually, Just War Theory 
            recommends an opposite response while, at the same time, condoning a 
            military response that is done at the right time, in the right way 
            against the right (i.e. bad) people. In their great need, those 
            people in countries where attackers train should be helped rather 
            than hurt. Indeed, it would be a brilliant tactical as well as 
            humanitarian move to bomb them with food, blankets and medical 
            supplies rather than with bombs and missiles. Winning their hearts 
            over might very well help prevent another 11 September someplace 
            else.</FONT> <!-- #EndEditable --></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
