            <DIV class=issuepublish>Issue of 2002-01-07<BR>Posted 
            2001-12-31</DIV></DIV>
            <P class=descender>The women of Afghanistan do not wish to be freed 
            from the strictures of the Taliban only to submit to a Western model 
            of women's liberation, or so various of their representatives have 
            reminded well-meaning American feminists during the past several 
            weeks. "Bring your democracy, not your bikinis" is how Zohra Yusuf 
            Daoud, Miss Afghanistan of 1973, put it to the audience of a recent 
            conference in New York co-sponsored by Women for Afghan Women. In 
            fact, there are a number of women in this country whose theological 
            distaste for the bikini is combined with an appreciation for civil 
            rights: American Muslim feminists. Some of these women read the 
            Koran as a document that secures women's rights rather than as a 
            blueprint for oppression, in spite of the evidence, throughout the 
            Muslim world, of the originality of such an interpretation. The 
            picture they present of God's plan for women is not quite consistent 
            with American-style equality; instead, it suggests that the Muslim 
            woman would be the most pampered, privileged creature on the planet, 
            if only she knew her due.</P>
            <P>Azizah al-Hibri, a Lebanese-American professor of law at the 
            University of Richmond, in Virginia, who is an expert in the 
            prenuptial contract that traditionally regulates every Muslim 
            marriage, argues that, according to Islamic jurisprudence based on 
            the Koran, the contract can be used as an instrument by which a 
            woman can lay out her expectations about the shape she would like 
            her marriage, and thus her life, to take. "It goes back to the very 
            early days of Islam, when it was understood that women entered 
            marriage equally, unlike previous regimes, in which she was 
            chattel," al-Hibri says. A woman can secure her right to work 
            outside the home at any job she likes; she can reassert her right to 
            have her husband support her financially, even if she has a job or 
            is independently wealthy; she can keep her finances separate from 
            his and invest them wherever she wishes; she can specify the sum of 
            money she expects to receive should the marriage end in divorce or 
            should she be widowed; she can negotiate the right to divorce her 
            husband at will, should he, for example, take another wife; she can 
            reserve the right not to cook, to clean, or to nurse her own 
            children.</P>
            <P>Some American Muslim women even argue that Islam anticipates the 
            demands of Western feminists by more than a thousand years: a 
            stay-at-home wife can specify that she expects to receive a regular 
            stipend, which is not that far from the goals of the Wages for 
            Housework campaign of the nineteen-seventies. Elsewhere, the fully 
            empowered Muslim woman sounds like a self-assured, post-feminist 
            type—a woman who draws her inspiration from the example of Sukayna, 
            the brilliant, beautiful great-granddaughter of the Prophet 
            Muhammad, who was married several times, and, at least once, 
            stipulated in writing that her husband was forbidden to disagree 
            with her about anything.All these conditions are based on the canon 
            of Islam and on early Muslim practice, al-Hibri says, but they are 
            rarely applied, since centuries of male-dominated culture have so 
            obscured the essential equality of the sexes at the core of Islamic 
            marriage that a woman's failure to include these provisions in the 
            marriage contract can be understood as implying that she has waived 
            them.</P>
            <P>For non-Muslims who fret about the high divorce rate in this 
            country, the concept of a negotiated marital contract that makes 
            explicit the financial, social, and even sexual expectations that 
            each partner brings to the union has a certain appeal. Although 
            wealthy Americans may have discovered the usefulness of the prenup, 
            the dominant view of marriage in American culture is that it is a 
            largely romantic endeavor rather than an arrangement based, at least 
            in part, on pragmatism. Unfortunately, most Islamic marriages bear 
            about as much relation to this paradigm as most American marriages 
            bear to a Nora Ephron movie. Marriage contracts generally go no 
            further than specifying the size of the bride's <SPAN 
            class=italic>mahr</SPAN>—a sort of dowry the groom must pay 
            her—because many Muslim women are illinformed of their rights, and, 
            even if they do know them, lack the financial and social leverage to 
            assert them. Things are even tougher for a woman who might prefer 
            not to marry, or is obliged to remain single. And al-Hibri's 
            pro-woman readings of the Koran are, at times, less than persuasive: 
            in a recent essay for the <SPAN class=italic>Journal of Law &amp; 
            Religion</SPAN>, she acknowledges that the Koran permits a husband 
            to beat his wife, though she argues that a correct reading of the 
            verse indicates that he should use nothing more injurious than a 
            <SPAN class=italic>miswak</SPAN>, a twig that commonly serves as a 
            toothbrush in the Arabian peninsula.</P>
            <P>A group of Muslim women in Washington, among them Sima Wali, a 
            delegate to the Afghan conference in Bonn last month, has been 
            drawing up a list of legislative recommendations for a reconstructed 
            Afghanistan, including a woman's right to vote and her right of 
            access to medical treatment. Also included is the suggestion that 
            girls receive marriage-contract education in the schools when, as it 
            is hoped, they return to them in the spring. If a particularly 
            bright young Afghan girl should ask why, if Islam is predicated on 
            equality and harmony between the sexes, a woman should be advised to 
            load her contract with conditions that restrict her husband's 
            capacity to exploit her, al-Hibri has an answer. "The way I explain 
            it is that God understands patriarchy, because God created man," she 
            says. "He realized immediately that women need affirmative action." 
            American feminists have never been particularly celebrated for a 
            sense of irony; Afghan feminists, assuredly, will need one.</P>
