            new phase, and intellectuals have not hesitated to proliferate 
            visions of what it will be - the end of history, the return of 
            traditional rivalries between nation states, and the decline of the 
            nation state from the conflicting pulls of tribalism and globalism, 
            among others. Each of these visions catches aspects of the emerging 
            reality. Yet they all miss a central aspect of what global politics 
            is likely to be in the coming years. 
            <P>It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in 
            this new world will not be primarily ideological nor primarily 
            economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating 
            source of conflict will be cultural. Nation states will remain the 
            most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts 
            of global politics will occur between nations and groups of 
            different civilisations. The fault lines between civilisations will 
            be the battle lines of the future. 
            <P>Conflict between civilisations will be the latest phase in the 
            evolution of conflict in the modern world. For a century and a half 
            after the emergence of the modern international system with the 
            Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the conflicts of the western world were 
            largely among princes-emperors, absolute monarchs and constitutional 
            monarchs attempting to expand their bureaucracies, their armies, 
            their mercantilist economic strength and, most important, the 
            territory they ruled. In the process they created nation states, and 
            beginning with the French revolution the principal lines of conflict 
            were between nations rather than princes. In 1793, as R. R. Palmer 
            put it, "The wars of kings were over; the wars of peoples had 
            begun." 
            <P>This 19th-century pattern lasted until the end of the first world 
            war. Then, as a result of the Russian revolution and the reaction 
            against it, the conflict of nations yielded to the conflict of 
            ideologies, first among communism, fascism-Nazism and liberal 
            democracy, and then between communism and liberal democracy. During 
            the Cold War, this latter conflict became embodied in the struggle 
            between the two superpowers, neither of which was a nation state in 
            the classical European sense and each of which defined its identity 
            in terms of its ideology. 
            <P>These conflicts between princes, nation states and ideologies 
            were primarily conflicts within western civilisation. "Western civil 
            wars," as William Lind has labeled them. This was as true of the 
            cold war as it was of the world wars and the earlier wars of the 
            17th, 18th and 19th centuries. With the end of the cold war, 
            international politics moves out of its western phase and its 
            centrepiece becomes the interaction between the West and non-western 
            civilisations and among non-western civilisations. In the politics 
            of civilisations, the peoples and governments of non-western 
            civilisations no longer remain the objects of history as targets of 
            western colonialism but join the West as movers and shapers of 
            history. 
            <P>During the cold war the world was divided into the First, Second 
            and Third Worlds. Those divisions are no longer relevant. It is far 
            more meaningful now to group countries not in terms of their 
            political or economic systems or in terms of their level of economic 
            development but rather in terms of their culture and civilisation. 
            <P>What do we mean when we talk of a civilisation? A civilisation is 
            a cultural entity. Villages, regions, ethnic groups, nationalities, 
            religious groups, all have distinct cultures at different levels of 
            cultural heterogeneity. The culture of a village in southern Italy 
            may be different from that of a village in northern Italy, but both 
            will share in a common Italian culture that distinguishes them from 
            German villages. European communities, in turn, will share cultural 
            features that distinguish them from Arab or Chinese communities. 
            Arabs, Chinese and westerners, however, are not part of any broader 
            cultural entity. They constitute civilisations. 
            <P>A civilisation is thus the highest cultural grouping of people 
            and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of 
            that which distinguishes humans from other species. It is defined 
            both by common objective elements, such as language, history, 
            religion, customs, institutions, and by the subjective 
            self-identification of people. People have levels of identity: a 
            resident of Rome may define himself with varying degrees of 
            intensity as a Roman, an Italian, a Catholic, a Christian, a 
            European, a westerner. The civilisation to which he belongs is the 
            broadest level of identification with which he intensely identifies. 
            People can and do redefine their identities and, as a result, the 
            composition and boundaries of civilisations change. 
            <P>Civilisations may involve a large number of people, as with China 
            ("a civilization pretending to be a state," as Lucian Pye put it) , 
            or a small number of people, such as the Anglophone Caribbean. A 
            civilisation may include several nation states, as is the case with 
            western, Latin American and Arab civilisations, or only one, as is 
            the case with Japanese civilisation. 
            <P>Civilisations obviously blend and overlap, and may include 
            subcivilisations. Western civilisation has two big variants, 
            European and North American, and Islam has its Arab, Turkic and 
            Malay subdivisions. Civilisations are nonetheless meaningful 
            entities, and while the lines between them are seldom sharp, they 
            are real. Civilisations are dynamic: they rise and fall, they divide 
            and merge. And, as any student of history knows, civiliszations 
            disappear and are buried in the sands of time. 
            <P>Westerners tend to think of nation states as the principal actors 
            in global affairs. They have been that, however, for only a few 
            centuries. The broader reaches of human history have been the 
            history of civilisations. In A Study of History, Arnold Toynhee 
            identified 21 major civilizations; only six of them exist in the 
            contemporary world. Civilisation identity will be increasingly 
            important in the future, and the world will be shaped in large 
            measure by the interactions among seven or eight main civilisations. 
            These include western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, 
            Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African civilisation. 
            The most important conflicts will occur along the cultural fault 
            lines separating these civilisations from one another. 
            <P>Why will this be the case? First, differences among civilisations 
            are not only real, they are basic. Civilisations are differentiated 
            from each other by history, language, culture, tradition and, most 
            important, religion. The people of different civilisations have 
            different views on the relations between God and man, the individual 
            and the group, the citizen and the state, parents and children, 
            husband and wife, as well as differing views of the relative 
            importance of rights and responsibilities, liberty and authority, 
            equality and hierarchy. 
            <P>T</B>hese differences are the product of centuries. They will not 
            soon disappear. They are far more fundamental than differences among 
            political ideologies and political regimes. Differences do not 
            necessarily mean conflict, and conflict does not necessarily mean 
            violence. Over the centuries, however, differences among 
            civilisations have generated the most prolonged and violent 
            conflicts. 
            <P>Second, the world is becoming a smaller place. The increasing 
            interactions between peoples of different civilisations are 
            increasing; and these increasing interactions intensify 
            civilisation-consciousness and awareness of differences between 
            civilisations and of commonalities within civilisations. North 
            African immigration to France generates hostility among Frenchmen 
            and at the same time increases receptivity to immigration by "good" 
            European Catholic Poles. Americans react far more negatively to 
            Japanese investment than to larger investments from Canada and 
            European countries. 
            <P>As Donald Horowitz has pointed out, 'An Ibo may be ... an Owerri 
            Ibo or an Onitsha Ibo in what was the Eastern region of Nigeria. In 
            Lagos, he is simply an Ibo. In London, he is a Nigerian. In New 
            York, he is an African." The increasing interactions among peoples 
            of different civilizations enhance the increased 
            civilisation-consciousness of people that which, in turn, 
            invigorates invigorates differences and animosities stretching, or 
            thought to stretch, back deep into history. 
            <P>Third, the processes of economic modernisation and social change 
            throughout the world are separating people from long-standing local 
            identities. They also weaken the nation state as a source of 
            identity. In much of the world religion has moved in to fill this 
            gap, often in the form of movements that are labelled 
            "fundamentalist". Such movements are found in western Christianity, 
            Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism, as well as in Islam. In most 
            religions the people active in fundamentalist movements are young, 
            college-educated, middle-class technicians, professionals and 
            business persons. 
            <P>The "unsecularization of the world," George Weigel has remarked, 
            "is one of the dominant social facts of life in the late twentieth 
            century." The revival of religion , "Ia revanche de DieuP as Gilles 
            Kepel labeled it, provides a basis for identity and commitment that 
            transcends national boundaries and unites civilisations. 
            <P>Fourth, the growth of civilisation-consciousness is enhanced by 
            the dual role of the West. On the one hand, the West is at a peak of 
            power. At the same time, however, and perhaps as a result, a 
            return-to-the-roots phenomenon is occurring among non-western 
            civilisations. Increasingly one hears references to trends towards a 
            turning inward and "Asianisation" in Japan, the end of the Nehru 
            legacy and the "Hinduisation" of India, the failure of western ideas 
            of socialism and nationalism and hence "re-Islamisation" of the 
            Middle East. And now a debate over westernisation versus 
            Russianisation in Moscow. A West at the peak of its power confronts 
            non-Wests that increasingly have the desire, the will and the 
            resources to shape the world in non-western ways. 
            <P>In the past, the elites of non-western societies were usually the 
            people who were most involved with the West, had been educated at 
            Oxford or the Sorbonne and had absorbed western attitudes and 
            values. At the same time, the populace in non-western countries 
            often remained deeply imbued with the indigenous culture. Now, 
            however, these relationships are being reversed. A de-westernisation 
            and indigenisation of elites is occurring in many non-western 
            countries at the same time that western, usually American, cultures, 
            styles and habits become more popular. 
            <P>Fifth, cultural characteristics and differences are less mutable 
            and hence less easily compromised and resolved than political and 
            economic ones. In the former Soviet Union, communists can become 
            democrats, the rich can become poor and the poor rich, but Russians 
            cannot become Estonians and Azeris cannot become Armenians. 
            <P>In class and ideological conflicts, the key question was: "Which 
            side are you on?" and people could and did choose sides and change 
            sides. In conflicts between civilisations, the question is: "What 
            are you?" That is a given that cannot be changed. And as we know, 
            from Bosnia to the Caucasus to Sudan, the wrong answer to that 
            question can mean a bullet in the head. Even more than ethnicity; 
            religion discriminates sharply and exclusively among people. A 
            person can be half-French and half-Arab and, simultaneously, even a 
            citizen of two countries. It is more difficult to be half-Catholic 
            and half-Muslim. 
            <P>Finally, economic regionalism is increasing. The proportions of 
            total trade that were intraregional rose between 1980 and 1989 from 
            51% percent to 59% percent in Europe, 33% perccnt to 37% percent in 
            East Asia, and 31% to 36 percent in North America. The importance of 
            regional economic blocs is likely to continue to increase. On the 
            one hand, successful economic regionalism will reinforce 
            civilisation-consciousness. 
            <P>On the other hand, economic regionalism may succeed only when it 
            is rooted in a common civilisation. 
            <P>The European Community rests on the shared foundation of European 
            culture and western Christianity. The success of the North American 
            Free Trade Area depends on the convergence now under way of Mexican, 
            Canadian and American cultures. Japan, in contrast, faces 
            difficulties in creating a comparable economic entity in east Asia 
            because Japan is a society and civilisation unique to itself. 
            However strong the trade and investment links Japan may develop with 
            other east Asian countries, its cultural differences with those 
            countries inhibit and perhaps preclude its promoting regional 
            economic integration like that in Europe and North Amenca. 
            <P>Common culture, in contrast, is clearly facilitating the rapid 
            expansion of the economic relations between the People's Republic of 
            China, Taiwan, Singapore and the overseas Chinese communities in 
            other Asian countries. With the Cold War over, cultural 
            cornmonalities increasingly overcome ideological differences, and 
            mainland China and Taiwan move closer together. If cultural 
            commonality is a prerequisite for economic integration, the 
            principal east Asian economic bloc of the future is likely to be 
            centred on China. This bloc is, in fact, already coming into 
            existence. As Murray Weidenbaum has observed, culture and religion 
            also form the basis of the Economic Cooperation Organization, which 
            brings together ten non-Arab Muslim countries: Iran, Pakistan, 
            Turkeys Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyastan, Turkmenistan, 
            Tadjikistan, Uzbeldstan and Afghan-istan. The impetus to the revival 
            and expansion of this organization, founded originally in the 1960s 
            by Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, is the realization by the leaders of 
            several of these countries that they had no chance of admission to 
            the European Community Similarly, Caricom, the Central American 
            Common Market and Mercosur rest on common cultural foundations. 
            Efforts to build a broader Caribbean-Central American economic 
            entity bridging the Anglo-Latin divide, however, have to date 
            failed. 
            <P>A</B>s people define their identity in ethnic and religious 
            terms, they are likely to see an us-versus-them relationship 
            existing between themselves and people of different ethnicity or 
            religion. The end of ideologically defined states in eastern Europe 
            and the former Soviet Union permits traditional ethnic identities 
            and animosities to come to the fore. Differences in culture and 
            religion create differences over policy issues, ranging from human 
            rights to immigration to trade and commerce to the environment. 
            Geographical propinquity gives rise to conflicting territorial 
            claims from Bosnia to Mindanao. 
            <P>Most important, the efforts of the West to promote its values of 
            democracy and liberalism as universal values, to maintain its 
            military predominance and to advance its economic interests engender 
            countering responses from other civilisations. Decreasingly able to 
            mobilise support and form coalitions on the basis of ideology, 
            governments and groups will increasingly attempt to mobilise support 
            by appealing to common religion and civilisation identity. 
            <P>The clash of civilisations thus occurs at two levels. At the 
            micro-level, adjacent groups along the fault lines between 
            civilisations struggle, often violently, over the control of 
            territory and each other. At the macro-level, states from different 
            civilisations compete for relative military and economic power, 
            struggle over the control of international institutions and third 
            parties, and competitively promote their political and religious 
            values. 
            <P>The fault lines between civilisations are replacing the political 
            and ideological boundaries of the cold war as the flash points for 
            crisis and bloodshed. The cold war began when the Iron Curtain 
            divided Europe politically and ideologically. The cold war ended 
            with the fall of the Iron Curtain. As the ideological division of 
            Europe has disappeared, the cultural division between western 
            Christianity and Orthodox Christianity and Islam has re-emerged. 
            <P>The most significant dividing line in Europe, as William Wallace 
            has suggested, may well be the eastern boundary of Western 
            Christianity in the year 1500. This line runs along what are now the 
            boundaries between Finland and Russia and between the Baltic states 
            and Russia, cuts through Belarus and Ukraine separating the more 
            Catholic western Ukraine from Orthodox eastern Ukraine, swings 
            westward separating Transylvania from the rest of Romania, and then 
            goes through Yugoslavia almost exactly along the line now separating 
            Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia. In the Balkans 
            this line, of course, coincides with the historic boundary between 
            the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires. 
            <P>The peoples to the north and west of this line are Protestant or 
            Catholic, they shared the common experiences of Euro-pean 
            histoxy-feudalism, the rennaissance, the Reformation, the 
            Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution; 
            they are generally economically better off than the peoples to the 
            east; and they may now look forward to increasing involvement in a 
            common European economy and to the consolidation of democratic 
            political systems. The peoples to the east and south of this line 
            are Orthodox or Muslim; they historically belonged to the Ottoman or 
            Tsarist empires and were only lightly touched by the shaping events 
            in the rest of Europe; they are generally less advanced 
            economically; they seem much less likely to develop stable 
            democratic political systems. 
            <P>The Velvet Curtain of culture has replaced the Iron Curtain of 
            ideology as the most significant dividing line in Europe. As the 
            events in Yugoslavia show, it is not only a line of difference; it 
            is also at times a line of bloody conflict. 
            <P>C</B>onflict along the fault line between western and Islamic 
            civilisations has been going on for 1,300 years. After the founding 
            of Islam, the Arab and Moorish surge west and north only ended at 
            Tours in 732. From the eleventh to the thirteenth century the 
            Crusaders attempted with temporary success to bring Christianity and 
            Christian rule to the Holy Land. From the 14th to the 17th century, 
            the Ottoman Turks reversed the balance, extended their sway over the 
            Middle East and the Balkans, captured Constantinople, and twice laid 
            siege to Vienna. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as 
            Ottoman power declined Britain, France, and Italy established 
            Western control over most of North Africa and the Middle East.
            <P>After World War II, the West, in turn, began to retreat; the 
            colonial empires disappeared; first Arab nationalism and then 
            Islamic fundamentalism manifested themselves; the West became 
            heavily dependent on the Persian Gulf countries for its energy; the 
            oil-rich Muslim countries became money-rich and, when they wished 
            to, weapons-rich. Several wars occurred between Arabs and Israel 
            (created by the West). France fought a bloody and ruthless war in 
            Algeria for most of the 1950s; British and French forces invaded 
            Egypt in 1956; American forces went into Lebanon in 1958; 
            subsequently American forces returned to Lebanon, attacked Libya, 
            and engaged in various military encounters with Iran; Arab and 
            Islamic terrorists, supported by at least three Middle Eastern 
            governrnents, employed the weapon of the weak and bombed Western 
            planes and installations and seized Western hostages. 
            <P>This warfare between Arabs and the West culminated in 1990, when 
            the United States and its western allies sent a massive army to the 
            Persian Gulf to defend some Arab countries against aggression by 
            another. In its aftermath, Nato planning is increasingly directed to 
            potential threats and instability along its "southern tier". 
            <P>This centuries-old military interaction between the West and 
            Islam is unlikely to decline. It could become more virulent. The 
            Gulf war left some Arabs feeling proud that Saddam Hussein had 
            attacked Israel and stood up to the West. It also left many feeling 
            humiliated and resentful of the West's military presence in the 
            Persian Gulf, the West's overwhelming military dominance, and their 
            apparent inability to shape their own destiny. 
            <P>Many Arab countries are reaching levels of economic and social 
            development where autocratic forms of government become 
            inappropriate and efforts to introduce democracy become stronger. 
            Some openings in Arab political systems have already occurred. The 
            principal beneficiaries of these openings have been Islamist 
            movements. In the Arab world, in short, western democracy 
            strengthens anti-western political forces. This may be a passing 
            phenomenon, but it surely complicates relations between Islamic 
            countries and the West. 
            <P>Those relations are also complicated by demography. The 
            spectacular population growth in Arab countries, particularly in 
            north Africa, has led to increased migration to western Europe. The 
            movement within western Europe towards minimising internal 
            boundaries has sharpened political sensitivities with respect to 
            this development. In Italy, France and Germany racism is 
            increasingly open, and violence against Arab and Turkist migrants 
            has become more intense and more widespread. 
            <P>On both sides the interaction between Islam and the West is seen 
            as a clash of civilisations. The West's "next confrontation" 
            observes M J Akbar, an Indian Muslim author, "is definitely going to 
            come from the Muslim world". It is in the sweep of the Islamic 
            nations from the maghreb to Pakistan that the struggle for a new 
            world order will begin." 
            <P>Bernard Lewis, the pre-eminent western historian of Islam, comes 
            to a similar conclusion: "We are facing a mood and a movement far 
            transcending the level of issues and policies and the governments 
            that pursue them. 
            <P>"This is no less than a clash of civilisations - the perhaps 
            irrational but surely historic reaction of an ancient rival against 
            our Judaeo-Christian heritage, our secular present, and the 
            worldwide expansion of both." Historically the other great 
            antagonistic interaction of Arab Islamic civilisation has been with 
            the pagan, animist and now increasingly Christian black peoples to 
            the south. In the past, this antagonisim was epitomised in the image 
            of Arab slave dealers and black slaves. It has been reflected in the 
            ongoing civil war in the Sudan between Arabs and blacks, the 
            fighting in Chad between Libayan-supported insurgents and the 
            government, the tensions between Orthodox Christians and Muslims in 
            the Horn of Africa, and the political conflicts, recurring riots and 
            communal violence between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria. The 
            modernization of Africa and the spread of Christianity are likely to 
            enhance the probability of violence along this fault line. 
            Symptomatic of the intensification of this conflict was the Pope 
            John Paul II's speech in Khartoum in February 1993 attacking the 
            actions of the Sudan's Islamist government against the Christian 
            minority there.
            <P>On the northern border of Islam, conflict has increasingly 
            erupted between Orthodox and Muslim peoples, including the carnage 
            of Bosnia and Sarajevo, the simmering violence between Serb and 
            Albanian, the tenuous relations between Bulgarians and their Turkish 
            minority., the violence between Ossetians and Ingush, the 
            unremitting slaughter of each other by Armenians and Azeris, the 
            tense relations between Russians and Muslims in Central Asia, and 
            the deployment of Russian troops to protect Russian interests in the 
            Caucasus and Central Asia. Religion reinforces the revival of ethnic 
            idcntities and restimulates Russian fears about thc security of 
            their southern borders. This concern is well captured by Archie 
            Roosevelt:
            <P>
            <UL>"Much of Russian history concems the struggle between the 
              Slavs and the Turkic peoples on their borders, which dates back to 
              the foundation of the Russian state more than a thousand years 
              ago. In the Slays' millennium-long confrontation with their 
              eastern neighbors lies the key to an understanding not only of 
              Russian history, but Russian character. To understand Russian 
              realities today one has to have a eonccpt of the great Turkic 
              ethnic group that has preoccupicd Russians through the 
            centuries."</UL>
            <P>The conflict of civilizations is deeply rooted elsewhere in Asia. 
            The historic clash between Muslim and Hindu in the subcontinent 
            manifests itself now not only in the rivalry between Pakistan and 
            India but also in intensifying religious strife within India between 
            increasingly militant Hindu groups and India's substantial Muslim 
            minority. The destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in December 199Z 
            brought to the fore the issue of whether India will remain a secular 
            democratic state or become a Hindu one. In East Asia, China has 
            outstanding territorial disputes with most of its neighbors. It has 
            pursued a ruthless policy toward the Buddhist people of Tibet, and 
            it is pursuing an increasingly ruthless policy toward its 
            Turkic-Muslim minority. With the Cold War over, the underlying 
            differences between China and the United States have reasserted 
            themselves in areas such as human rights, trade and weapons 
            proliferation. These differences are unlikely to moderate. A "new 
            cold war," Deng Xaioping reportedly asserted in 1991 is under way 
            between China and America.
            <P>The same phrase has been applied to the increasingly difficult 
            relations between Japan and the United States. Here cultural 
            difference exaccerbates economic conflict. People on each side 
            allege racism on the other, but at least on the American side the 
            antipathies are not racial but cultural. The basic values, 
            attitudes, behavioral patterns of the two societies could hardly be 
            more different. The economic issues between the United States and 
            Europe are no less serious than those between the United States and 
            Japan, but they do not have the same political salience and 
            emotional intensity becausc thE differences between American culture 
            and European culture are so much less than thosc between American 
            civilization and Japanese civilization.
            <P>
            <P>The interactions between civilisations vary greatly in the extent 
            to which they are likely to be characterised by violence. Economic 
            competition clearly predominates between the American and European 
            subcivilisations of the West and between both of them and Japan. On 
            the Eurasian continent, however, the proliferation of ethnic 
            conflict, epitomised at the extreme in "ethnic cleansing", has not 
            been totally random. It has been most frequent and most violent 
            between groups belonging to different civilisations. In Eurasia the 
            great historic fault lines between civilisations are once more 
            aflame. This is particularly true along the boundaries of the 
            crescent-shaped Islamic bloc of nations from the bulge of Africa to 
            central Asia. Violence also occurs between Muslims, on the one hand, 
            and Orthodox Serbs in the Balkans, Jews in Israel, Hindus in India, 
            Buddhists in Burma and Catholics in the Philippines. Islam has 
            bloody borders. 
            <P>Groups or states belonging to one civilization that become 
            involved in war with people from a different civilization naturally 
            try to rally support from other members of their own civilization. 
            As the post-Cold War world evolves, civilization commonality, what 
            H. D. S. Greenway has termed the "kin-country" syndrome, is 
            replacing political ideology and traditional balance of power 
            considerations as the principal basis for cooperation and 
            coalitions. It can be seen gradually emerging in the post-Cold War 
            conflicts in the Persian Gulf; the Caucasus and Bosnia. None of 
            these was a full-scale war between civilizations, but each involved 
            some elements of civilizational rallying, which seemed to become 
            more important as the conflict continued and which may provide a 
            foretaste of the future.
            <P>First, in the Gulf War one Arab state invaded another and then 
            fought a coalition of Arab, Western and other states. While only a 
            few Muslim governments overtly supported Saddam Hussein, many Arab 
            elites privately cheered him on, and he was highly popular among 
            large sections of the Arab publics. Islamic fundamentalist movements 
            universally supported Iraq rather than the Western-backed 
            governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Forswearing Arab 
            nationalism, Saddam Hussein explicitly invoked an Islamic appeal. He 
            and his supporters attempted to define the war as a war between 
            civilizations. "It is not the world against Iraq," as Safar 
            Al-Hawali, dean of Islamic Studies at the Umm Al-Qura University in 
            Mecca, put it in a widely circulated tape. "It is the West against 
            Islam." Ignoring the rivalry between Iran and Iraq, the chief 
            Iranian religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for a holy 
            war against the West: "The struggle against American aggression, 
            greed, plans and policies will be counted as a jihad, and anybody 
            who is killed on that path is a martyr." "This is a war," King 
            Hussein of Jordan argued, "against all Arabs and all Muslims and not 
            against Iraq alone."
            <P>The rallying of substantial sections of Arab elites and publics 
            behind Saddam Hussein caused those Arab governments in the anti-Iraq 
            coalition to moderate their activities and temper their public 
            statements. Arab governments opposed or distanced themselves from 
            subsequent Western efforts to apply pressure on Iraq, including 
            enforcement of a no-fly zone in the summer of 1991 and the bombing 
            of Iraq in January 1993. The Western-Soviet-Turkish-Arab anti-Iraq 
            coalition of 1990 had by 1993 become a coalition of almost only the 
            West and Kuwait against Iraq. Muslims contrasted Western actions 
            against Iraq with the West's failure to protect Bosnians against 
            Serbs and to impose sanctions on Israel for violating UN 
            resolutions. The West, they alleged, was using a double standard. A 
            world of clashing civilizations, however, is inevitably a world of 
            double standards: people apply one standard to their kin-countries 
            and a different standard to others.
            <P>Islamic governments and groups, on the other hand, castigated the 
            West for not coming to the defense of the Bosnians. Iranian leaders 
            urged Muslims from all countries to provide help to Bosnia; in 
            violation of the U.N. arms embargo, Iran supplied weapons and men 
            for the Bosnians; Iranian-supported Lebanese groups sent guerrillas 
            to train and organize the Bosnian forces. In 1993 up to 4000 Muslims 
            from over two dozen Islamic countries were reported to be fighting 
            in Bosnia. The governments of Saudi Arabia and other countries felt 
            under increasing pressure from fundamentalist groups in their own 
            societies to provide more vigorous support for the Bosnians. By the 
            end of 1992, Saudi Arabia had reportedly supplied substantial 
            funding for weapons and supplies for the Bosnians, which 
            sjgnificantly increased their military capabilities vis a vis the 
            Serbs.
            <P>In the 1930s the Spanish Civil War provoked intervention from 
            countries that politically were fascist, communist and democratic. 
            In the 1990s the Yugoslav conflict is provoking intervention from 
            countries that are Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian. The 
            parallel has not gone unnoticed. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
            become the emotional equivalent of the fight against fascism in the 
            Spanish Civil War," one Saudi editor observed. "Those who died there 
            are regarded as martyrs who tried to save their fellow Muslims."
            <P>Conflicts and violence will also occur between states and groups 
            within the same civilization. Such conflicts, however, are likely to 
            be less intense and less likely to expand than conflicts between 
            civilizations. Common membership in a civilization reduces the 
            probability of violence in situations wherc it might otherwise 
            occur. In 1991 and 1992 many people were alarmed by the possibility 
            of violent conflict between Russia and Ukraine over territory, 
            particularly Crimea, the Black Sea fleet, nuclear weapons and 
            economic issues. If civilization is what counts, however, the 
            likelihood of violence between Ukrainians and Russians should be 
            low. They are two Slavic, primarily Orthodox peoples who have had 
            close relationships with each other for centuries. As of early 1993, 
            despite all the reasons for conflict, the leaders of the two 
            countries were effectively negotiating and defusing the issues 
            between the two countries. While there has been serious fighting 
            between Muslims and Christians elsewhere in the former Soviet Union 
            and much tension and some fighting between Western and Orthodox 
            Christians in the Baltic states, there has been virtually no 
            violence between Russians and Ukrainians.
            <P>The West is now at an extraordinary peak of power in relation to 
            other civilizations. Its superpower opponent has disappeared from 
            the map. Military conflict among Western states is unthinkable, and 
            Western military power is unrivaled. Apart from Japan, the West 
            faces no economic challenge. It dominates international political 
            and security institutions and with Japan international economic 
            institutions. Global political and security issues are effectively 
            settled by a directorate of the United States, Britain and France, 
            world economic issues by a directorate of the United States, Germany 
            and Japan, all of which maintain extraordinarily close relations 
            with each other to the exclusion of lesser and largely non-Western 
            countries. Decisions made at the U.N. Security Council or in the 
            International Monetary Fund that reflect the interests of the West 
            are presented to the world as reflecting the desires of the world 
            community. 
            <P>The very phrase "the world community" has become the euphemistic 
            collective noun (replacing "the Free World") to give global 
            legitimacy to actions reflecting the interests of the United States 
            and other western powers. Through the IMF and other international 
            economic institutions, the West promotes its economic interests and 
            imposes on other nations the economic policies it thinks 
            appropriate. In any poll of non-Western peoples, the 1MF undoubtedly 
            would win the support of finance ministers and a few others, but get 
            an overwhelmingly unfavorable rating from just about everyone else, 
            who would agree with Georgy Arbatov's characterization of IMF 
            officials as "neo-Bolsheviks who love expropriating other people's 
            money, imposing undemocratic and alien rules of economic and 
            political conduct and stifling economic freedom."
            <P>Western domination of the U.N. Security Council and its 
            decisions, tempered only by occasional abstention by China, produced 
            U.N. legitimation of the West’s use of force to drive Iraq out of 
            Kuwait and its elimination of Iraq’s sophisticated weapons and 
            capacity to produce such weapons. It also produced the quite 
            unprecedented action by the United States, Britain and France in 
            getting the Security Council to demand that Libya hand over the Pan 
            Am 103 bombing suspects and then to impose sanctions when Libya 
            refused. After defeating the largest Arab army, the West did not 
            hesitate to throw its weight around in the Arab world. The West in 
            effect is using international institutions, military power and 
            economic resources to run the world in ways that will maintain 
            Western predominance, protect Western intextsrs and promote Western 
            political and economic values.
            <P>That at least is the way in which non-Westerners see the new 
            world, and thcre is a significant element of truth in their view. 
            Differences in power and struggles for military, economic and 
            institutional power are thus one source of conflict between the West 
            and other civilizations.
            <P>Differences in culture, that is basic values and beliefs, are a 
            second source of conflict. V. S. Naipaul has argued that Western 
            civilization is the "universal civilization" that "fits all men." At 
            a superficial level much of Western culture has indeed permeated the 
            rest of the world. At a more basic level, however, Western concepts 
            differ fundamentally from those prevalent in other civilizations. 
            Western ideas of individualism, liberalism, constitutionalism, human 
            rights, equality, liberty, the rule of law, democracy, free markets, 
            the separation of church and state, often have little resonance in 
            Islamic, Confucian, Japanese, Hindu, Buddhist or Orthodox cultures. 
            <P>Western efforts to propagate such ideas produce instead a 
            reaction against "human rights imperialism" and a reaffirmation of 
            indigenous values, as can be seen in the support for religious 
            fundamentalism by the younger generation in non-Western cultures. 
            The very notion that there could be a "universal civilization" is a 
            Western idea, directly at odds with the particularism of most Asian 
            societies and their emphasis on what distinguishes one people from 
            another. Indeed, the author of a review of 100 comparative studies 
            of values in different societies concluded that "the values that are 
            most important in the West arc least important worldwide."5 In the 
            political realm, of course, these differences are most manifest in 
            the efforts of the United States and other Western powers to induce 
            other peoples to adopt Western ideas concerning democracy and human 
            rights. Modern democratic government originated in the West. When it 
            has developed in non-Western societies it has usually been the 
            product of Western colonialism or imposition.
            <P>The central axis of world politics in the future is likely to be, 
            in Kishore Mahbubani's phrase, the conflict between "the West and 
            the Rest" and the responses of non-Western civilizations to Western 
            power and values.
            <P>Those responses generally take one or a combination of three 
            forms. At one extreme, non-Western states can, like Burma and North 
            Korea, attempt to pursue a course of isolation, to insulate their 
            societies from penetration or "corruption" by the West, and, in 
            effect, to opt out of participation in the Western-dominated global 
            community. The costs of this course, however, are high, and few 
            states have pursued it exclusively. A second alternative, the 
            equivalent of "band-wagoning" in international relations theory, is 
            to attempt to join the West and accept its values and institutions. 
            The third alternative is to attempt to "balance" the West by 
            developing economic and military power and cooperating with other 
            non-Western societies against the West, while preserving indigenous 
            valucs and institutions; in short, to modernize but not to 
            Westernize. 
            <P>The conflict between the West and the Confucian-Islamic states 
            focuses largely, although nor exclusively, on nuclear, chemical and 
            biological weapons, ballistic missiles and other sophisticated means 
            for delivering them, and the guidance, intelligence and other 
            electronic capabilities for achieving that goal. The West promotes 
            nonproliferation as a universal norm and nonproliferation treaties 
            and inspections as means of realizing that norm. It also threatens a 
            variety of sanctions against those who promote the spread of 
            sophisticated weapons and proposes some benefits for those who do 
            not. The attention of the West focuses, naturally, on nations that 
            are actually or potentially hostile to the West.
            <P>The non-Western nations, on the other hand, assert their right to 
            acquire and to deploy whatever weapons they think necessary for 
            their security. They also have absorbed, to the full, the truth of 
            the response of the Indian defense minister when asked what lesson 
            he learned from the<NO><NO1> Gulf War: "Don't fight the United 
            States unless you have nuclear weapons." Nuclear weapons, chemical 
            weapons and missiles are viewed, probably erroneously, as the 
            potential equalizer of superior Western conventional power. China, 
            of course, already has nuclear weapons; Pakistan and India have the 
            capability to deploy them. North Korea, lran, Iraq, Libya and 
            Algeria appear to be attempting to acquire them. A top Iranian 
            official has declared that all Muslim states should acquire nuclear 
            weapons, and in 1988 the president of Iran reportedly issued a 
            directive calling for development of "offensive and defensive 
            chemical, biological and radiological weapons."
            <P>Centrally important to the development of counter-West military 
            capabilities is the sustained expansion of China's military power 
            and its means to create military power. Buoyed by spectacular 
            economic development, China is rapidly increasing its military 
            spending and vigorously moving forward with the modernization of its 
            armed forces. It is purchasing weapons from the former Soviet 
            states; it is developing long-range missiles; in 1992 it tested a 
            one-megaton nuclear device. It is developing power-projection 
            capabilities, acquiring aerial refueling technology, and trying to 
            purchase an aircraft carrier. Its military buildup and assertion of 
            sovereignty over the South China Sea are provoking a multilateral 
            regional arms race in East Asia. China is also a major exporter of 
            arms and weapons technology. It has exported materials to Libya and 
            Iraq that could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons and nerve 
            gas. It has helped Algeria build a reactor suitable for nuclear 
            weapons research and production. China has sold to Iran nuclear 
            technology that American officials believe could only be used to 
            create weapons and apparently has shipped components of 
            3oo-mile-range missiles to Pakistan. North Korea has had a nuclear 
            weapons program under way for some while and has sold advanced 
            missiles and missile technology to Syria and Iran. The flow of 
            weapons and weapons technology is generally from East Asia to the 
            Middle East. There is, however, some movement in the reverse 
            direction; China has received Stinger missiles from Pakistan.
            <P>A Confucian-Islamic military connection has thus come into being, 
            designed to promote acquisition by its members of the weapons and 
            weapons technologies needed to counter the military power of the 
            West. It may or may not last. At present, however, it is, as Dave 
            McCurdy has said, "a renegades' mutual support pact, run by the 
            proliferators and their backers." A ncw form of arms competition is 
            thus occurring between Is<NO><NO1>lamic-Confucian states and the 
            West. In an old-fashioned arms r<NO><NO1>ac<NO><NO1>e, each side 
            developed its own arms to balance or to achieve superiority against 
            the other side. In this new form of arms competition, one sidc is 
            developing its arms and the other side is attempting not to balance 
            but to limit and prevent that arms build-up while at the same time 
            reducing its own military capabilities.
            <P>This article does not argue that civilization identities will 
            replace all other identities, that nation states will disappear, 
            that each civilization will become a single coherent political 
            entity, that groups within a civilization will not conflict with and 
            even fight each other. This paper does set forth the hypotheses that 
            differences between civilizations are real and important; 
            civilization-consciousness is increasing; conflict between 
            civilizations will supplant ideological and other forms of conflict 
            as the dominant global form of conflict; international relations, 
            historically a game played out within Western civilization, will 
            increasingly be de-Westernized and become a game in which 
            non-Western civilizations are actors and not simply objects; 
            successful political, security and economic international 
            institutions are more likely to develop within civilizations than 
            across civilizations; conflicts between groups in different 
            civilizations will be more frequent, more sustained and more violent 
            than conflicts between groups in the same civilization; violent 
            conflicts between groups in different civilizations are the most 
            likely and most dangerous source of escalation that could lead to 
            global wars; the paramount axis of world politics will be the 
            relations between "the West and the Rest"; the elites in some torn 
            non-Western countries will try to make their countries part of the 
            West, but in most cases face major obstacles to accomplishing this; 
            a central focus of conflict for the immediate future will be between 
            the West and several Islamic-Confucian states.
            <P>This is not to advocate the desirability of conflicts between 
            civilizations. It is to set forth descriptive hypotheses as to what 
            the future may be like. If these are plausible hypotheses, however, 
            it is necessary to consider their implications for Western policy. 
            These implications should be divided between short-term advantage 
            and long-term accommodation. In the short term it is clearly in the 
            interest of the West to promote greater cooperation and unity within 
            its own civilization, particularly between its European and North 
            American components; to incorporate into the West societies in 
            Eastern Europe and Latin America whose cultures are close to those 
            of the West; to promote and maintain cooperative relations with 
            Russia and Japan; to prevent escalation of local inter-civilization 
            conflicts into major inter-civilization wars; to limit the expansion 
            of the military strength of Confucian and Islamic states; to 
            moderate the reduction of Western military capabilities and maintain 
            military superiority in East and Southwest Asia; to exploit 
            differences and conflicts among Confucian and Islamic states; to 
            support in other civilizations groups sympathetic to Western values 
            and interests; to strengthen international institutions that reflect 
            and legitimate Western interests and values and to promote the 
            involvement of non-Western states in those institutions.
            <P>In the longer term other measures would be called for. Western 
            civilization is both Western and modern. Non-Western civilizations 
            have attempted to become modern without becoming Western. To date 
            only Japan has fully succeeded in this quest. Non-Western 
            civilizations will continue to attempt to acquire the wealth, 
            technology, skills, machines and weapons that are part of being 
            modern. They will also attempt to reconcile this modernity with 
            their traditional culture and values. Their economic and military 
            strength relative to the West will increase. Hence The West will 
            increasingly have to accommodate these non-Western modern 
            civilisations whose power approaches that of the West but whose 
            values and interests differ significantly from those of the West. 
            This will require the West to maintain the economic and military 
            power necessary to protect its interests in relation to these 
            civilizations. It will also, however, require the West to develop a 
            more profound understanding of the basic religious and philosophical 
            assumptions underlying other civilizations and the ways in which 
            people in those civilizations see their interests. It will require 
            an effort to identify elements of commonality between Western and 
            other civilizations. For the relevant future, there will be no 
            urnversal civilization, but instead a world of different 
            civilizations, each of which will have to learn to coexist with the 
            others.
