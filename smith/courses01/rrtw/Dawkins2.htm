<H1><I>"Time to Stand Up"</I></H1>
<H3>By Richard Dawkins</H3>
<P><I>Written for the Freedom From Religion Foundation (<A 
href="http://www.ffrf.org/">http://www.ffrf.org/</A>), Madison, Wisconsin, 
September 2001.</I>
<P>"To blame Islam for what happened in New York is like blaming Christianity 
for the troubles in Northern Ireland!" Yes. Precisely. It is time to stop 
pussyfooting around. Time to get angry. And not only with Islam. 
<P>Those of us who have renounced one or another of the three "great" 
monotheistic religions have, until now, moderated our language for reasons of 
politeness. Christians, Jews and Muslims are sincere in their beliefs and in 
what they find holy. We have respected that, even as we have disagreed with it. 
The late Douglas Adams put it with his customary good humor, in an <A 
href="http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/index.html">impromptu speech in 
1998</A> (slightly abridged): 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now, the invention of the scientific method is, I'm sure we'll all 
  agree, the most powerful intellectual idea, the most powerful framework for 
  thinking and investigating and understanding and challenging the world around 
  us that there is, and it rests on the premise that any idea is there to be 
  attacked. If it withstands the attack then it lives to fight another day and 
  if it doesn't withstand the attack then down it goes. Religion doesn't seem to 
  work like that. It has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred 
  or holy or whatever. What it means is, "Here is an idea or a notion that 
  you're not allowed to say anything bad about; you're just not. Why 
  not?--because you're not!" If somebody votes for a party that you don't agree 
  with, you're free to argue about it as much as you like; everybody will have 
  an argument but nobody feels aggrieved by it. If somebody thinks taxes should 
  go up or down you are free to have an argument about it. But on the other hand 
  if somebody says 'I mustn't move a light switch on a Saturday,' you say, "I 
  <I>respect</I> that." 
  <P>The odd thing is, even as I am saying that, I am thinking "Is there an 
  Orthodox Jew here who is going to be offended by the fact that I just said 
  that?" But I wouldn't have thought "Maybe there's somebody from the left wing 
  or somebody from the right wing or somebody who subscribes to this view or the 
  other in economics" when I was making the other points. I just think "Fine, we 
  have different opinions." But, the moment I say something that has something 
  to do with somebody's (I'm going to stick my neck out here and say irrational) 
  beliefs, then we all become terribly protective and terribly defensive and say 
  "No, we don't attack that; that's an irrational belief but no, we respect it." 

  <P>Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Labor party 
  or the Conservative party, Republicans or Democrats, this model of economics 
  versus that, Macintosh instead of Windows--but to have an opinion about how 
  the Universe began, about who created the Universe . . . no, that's holy? What 
  does that mean? Why do we ring-fence that for any other reason other than that 
  we've just got used to doing so? There's no other reason at all, it's just one 
  of those things that crept into being and once that loop gets going it's very, 
  very powerful. So, we are used to not challenging religious ideas but it's 
  very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it! 
  Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it because you're not allowed to say 
  these things. Yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those 
  ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other, except that we have agreed 
  somehow between us that they shouldn't be. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Douglas is dead, but I think he would join me in asking people now to stand 
up and break this absurd taboo. My respect for the Abrahamic religions went up 
in the smoke and choking dust of September 11th. The last vestige of respect for 
the taboo disappeared as I watched the "Day of Prayer" in Washington Cathedral, 
where people of mutually incompatible faiths united in homage to the very force 
that caused the problem in the first place: religion. It is time for people of 
intellect, as opposed to people of faith, to stand up and say "Enough!" Let our 
tribute to the dead be a new resolve: to respect <I>people</I> for what they 
individually <I>think,</I> rather than respect <I>groups</I> for what they were 
collectively brought up to <I>believe.</I>
<P>Notwithstanding bitter sectarian hatreds over the centuries (all too 
obviously still going strong), Judaism, Islam and Christianity have much in 
common. Despite New Testament watering down and other reformist tendencies, all 
three pay historic allegiance to the same violent and vindictive God of Battles, 
memorably summed up by Gore Vidal in 1998: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The great unmentionable evil at the center of our culture is 
  monotheism. From a barbaric Bronze Age text known as the Old Testament, three 
  anti-human religions have evolved--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These are 
  sky-god religions. They are, literally, patriarchal--God is the Omnipotent 
  Father--hence the loathing of women for 2,000 years in those countries 
  afflicted by the sky-god and his earthly male delegates. The sky-god is a 
  jealous god, of course. He requires total obedience from everyone on earth, as 
  he is not just in place for one tribe, but for all creation. Those who would 
  reject him must be converted or killed for their own good. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In <A 
href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html">The 
Guardian of 15th September</A>, I named belief in an afterlife as the key weapon 
that made the New York atrocity possible. Of prior significance is religion's 
deep responsibility for the underlying hatreds that motivated people to use that 
weapon in the first place. To breathe such a suggestion, even with the most 
gentlemanly restraint, is to invite an onslaught of patronizing abuse, as 
Douglas Adams noted. But the insane cruelty of the suicide attacks, and the 
equally vicious though numerically less catastrophic 'revenge' attacks on 
hapless Muslims living in America and Britain, push me beyond ordinary caution. 
<P>How can I say that religion is to blame? Do I really imagine that, when a 
terrorist kills, he is motivated by a theological disagreement with his victim? 
Do I really think the Northern Ireland pub bomber says to himself "Take that, 
Tridentine Transubstantiationist bastards!" Of course I don't think anything of 
the kind. Theology is the last thing on the minds of such people. They are not 
killing because of religion itself, but because of political grievances, often 
justified. They are killing because the other lot killed their fathers. Or 
because the other lot drove their great grandfathers off their land. Or because 
the other lot oppressed our lot economically for centuries. 
<P>My point is not that religion itself is the motivation for wars, murders and 
terrorist attacks, but that religion is the principal <I>label,</I> and the most 
dangerous one, by which a "they" as opposed to a "we" can be identified at all. 
I am not even claiming that religion is the only label by which we identify the 
victims of our prejudice. There's also skin color, language, and social class. 
But often, as in Northern Ireland, these don't apply and religion is the only 
divisive label around. Even when it is not alone, religion is nearly always an 
incendiary ingredient in the mix as well. 
<P>It is not an exaggeration to say that religion is the most inflammatory 
enemy-labelling device in history. Who killed your father? Not the individuals 
you are about to kill in 'revenge.' The culprits themselves have vanished over 
the border. The people who stole your great grandfather's land have died of old 
age. You aim your vendetta at those who belong to the same <I>religion</I> as 
the original perpetrators. It wasn't Seamus who killed your brother, but it was 
Catholics, so Seamus deserves to die "in return." Next, it was Protestants who 
killed Seamus so let's go out and kill some Protestants "in revenge." It was 
Muslims who destroyed the World Trade Center so let's set upon the turbaned 
driver of a London taxi and leave him paralyzed from the neck down. 
<P>The bitter hatreds that now poison Middle Eastern politics are rooted in the 
real or perceived wrong of the setting up of a Jewish State in an Islamic 
region. In view of all that the Jews had been through, it must have seemed a 
fair and humane solution. Probably deep familiarity with the Old Testament had 
given the European and American decision-makers some sort of idea that this 
really was the 'historic homeland' of the Jews (though the horrific stories of 
how Joshua and others conquered their <I>Lebensraum</I> might have made them 
wonder). Even if it wasn't justifiable at the time, no doubt a good case can be 
made that, since Israel exists now, to try to reverse the <I>status quo</I> 
would be a worse wrong. 
<P>I do not intend to get into that argument. But if it had not been for 
religion, the very concept of a Jewish state would have had no meaning in the 
first place. Nor would the very <I>concept</I> of Islamic lands, as something to 
be invaded and desecrated. In a world without religion, there would have been no 
Crusades; no Inquisition; no anti-Semitic pogroms (the people of the diaspora 
would long ago have intermarried and become indistinguishable from their host 
populations); no Northern Ireland Troubles (no label by which to distinguish the 
two 'communities,' and no sectarian schools to teach the children historic 
hatreds--they would simply be one community). 
<P>It is a spade we have here, let's <I>call</I> it a spade. The Emperor has no 
clothes. It is time to stop the mealy-mouthed euphemisms: 'Nationalists,' 
'Loyalists,' 'Communities,' 'Ethnic Groups.' <I>Religions</I> is the word you 
need. <I>Religion</I> is the word you are struggling hypocritically to avoid. 
<P>Parenthetically, religion is unusual among divisive labels in being 
spectacularly <I>unnecessary.</I> If religious beliefs had any evidence going 
for them, we might have to respect them in spite of their concomitant 
unpleasantness. But there is no such evidence. To label people as 
death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is 
bad enough. To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world inhabited 
by archangels, demons and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic. 
<P>The resilience of this form of hereditary delusion is as astonishing as its 
lack of realism. It seems that control of the plane which crashed near 
Pittsburgh was probably wrestled out of the hands of the terrorists by a group 
of brave passengers. The wife of one of these valiant and heroic men, after she 
took the telephone call in which he announced their intention, said that God had 
placed her husband on the plane as His instrument to prevent the plane crashing 
on the White House. I have the greatest sympathy for this poor woman in her 
tragic loss, but just <I>think</I> about it! As my (also understandably 
overwrought) American correspondent who sent me this piece of news said: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Couldn't God have just given the hijackers a heart attack or 
  something instead of killing all those nice people on the plane? I guess he 
  didn't care about the Trade Center, didn't bother to come up with a plan for 
  them." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Is there no catastrophe terrible enough to shake the faith of people, on both 
sides, in God's goodness and power? No glimmering realization that he might not 
be there at all: that we just might be on our own, needing to cope with the real 
world like grown-ups? 
<P>Billy Graham, Mr. Bush's spiritual advisor, said in Washington Cathedral: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But how do we understand something like this? Why does God allow 
  evil like this to take place? Perhaps that is what you are asking now. You may 
  even be angry at God. I want to assure you that God understands those feelings 
  that you may have. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Well, that's big of God, I must say. I'm sure that makes the bereaved feel a 
whole lot better (the pathetic thing is, it probably does!). Mr. Graham went on: 

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have been asked hundreds of times in my life why God allows 
  tragedy and suffering. I have to confess that I really do not know the answer 
  totally, even to my own satisfaction. I have to accept, by faith, that God is 
  sovereign, and He is a God of love and mercy and compassion in the midst of 
  suffering. The Bible says God is not the author of evil. It speaks of evil as 
  a "mystery." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Less baffled by this deep theological mystery were two of America's 
best-known televangelists, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. In a conversation on 
Robertson's lucrative television show (religion is tax-exempt), they knew 
<I>exactly</I> where to put the blame. The whole thing was obviously caused by 
America's <I>sin.</I> Falwell said that God had protected America wonderfully 
for 225 years, but now, what with abortion and gays and lesbians and the ACLU, 
"all of them who have tried to secularize America . . . I point the finger in 
their face and say you helped this happen." "Well, I totally concur," responded 
Robertson. Bush, to his credit, swiftly disowned this characteristic example of 
the religious mind at work. 
<P>The United States is the most religiose country in the Western world, and its 
born-again Christian leader is eyeball to eyeball with the most religiose people 
on Earth. Both sides believe that the Bronze Age God of Battles is on their 
side. Both take risks with the world's future in unshakeable, fundamentalist 
faith that He will grant them the victory. Incidentally, people speak of Islamic 
Fundamentalists, but the customary genteel distinction between fundamentalist 
and moderate Islam has been convincingly demolished by Ibn Warraq in his 
well-informed book, <I>Why I Am Not a Muslim.</I>
<P>The human psyche has two great sicknesses: the urge to carry vendetta across 
generations, and the tendency to fasten group labels on people rather than see 
them as individuals. Abrahamic religion gives strong sanction to both--and mixes 
explosively with both. Only the wilfully blind could fail to implicate the 
divisive force of religion in most, if not all, of the violent enmities in the 
world today. Without a doubt it is the prime aggravator of the Middle East. 
Those of us who have for years politely concealed our contempt for the dangerous 
collective delusion of religion need to stand up and speak out. Things are 
different now. "All is changed, changed utterly."
