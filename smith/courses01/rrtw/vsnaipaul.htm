      this controversial interview, first published in the <I>Literary 
      Review</I>, <B>V S Naipaul </B>speaks to <B>Farrukh Dhondy</B> about 
      <I>Half A Life</I>, his first novel in 22 years, and lashes out against 
      other established writers, some of them his contemporaries: Forster: 
      "…someone who didn't know Indian people", Narayan: "…his India is a ruin", 
      Soyinka: "…a marvelously Establishment figure actually" and Joyce: "…he is 
      not interested in the world." While indulging in his characteristic 
      plain-speak, Naipaul manages to remain consistently insightful about the 
      big issues: religion, history, society and the writerly life, without ever 
      losing sight of the individual struggles for existence that constitute the 
      heart of the human condition. In doing so, he shows how a writer's 
      worldview, achieved after a painful journey of self-discovery and 
      self-knowledge, can hold important lessons for humanity. <BR><BR>Also

      Wiltshire on a rare sunny English summer's day to interview V S Naipaul in 
      his country home. All his books, fiction and non-fiction, are to be 
      reissued (by Picador in Britain and Knopf in the USA), and this interview 
      anticipates the publication next month of his new novel, <I>Half a 
      Life</I>. Before we begin our conversation, Vidia shows me round his 
      garden, which stretches for an acre down a slope to the water meadows of 
      the River Avon. It contains myriad shades of green, the deep purple of 
      copper beech, several varieties of holly, some white blossoms, but no 
      flowerbeds. Vidia tells me the names of the trees and the prospects for 
      their growth, saying two or three times what a copse or hedge will look 
      like in years to come, 'when I shall be gone'.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT

      size=2>I've always tried not to write the same book. Every book is new. It 
      does different things. The material was knocking around in my head for a 
      quarter of a century. I don't keep a journal, but sometimes when I'm moved 
      by certain things I just make very brief notes in a particular notebook. 
      So there have been notes about this for a long time. But I didn't find any 
      way of putting it together. I got taken up with these major books you 
      mentioned. They were very taxing. But I had this material, and my 
      publishers and my agent required me to do a work of imagination. I was 
      required to do it.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>Well, it's a very powerful work of the 
      imagination. It takes us through three different settings, and three 
      different eras, and we meet people in different ways. We follow its 
      central character, Willy, from pre-independence India, to postwar London, 
      to a Portuguese province in Africa. </FONT></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
      color=#000000 size=3><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>I 
      tried to make it easy, and light, and a small book, and yet full of 
      things.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT 
      color=#000000>The theme is that of man in our times looking for a life and 
      perhaps having to borrow a life. Never living life to the 
      full?</FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>Don't you 
      think most people or many of the people we know are like 
      that?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT 
      color=#000000>Possibly, but I hadn't thought of it in those terms before. 
      I didn't estimate the percentage of life people had acquired for 
      themselves. But it's a telling way of 
      estimation.</FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>I 
      think most people think about it, and you feel less critical of yourself 
      for not achieving a full life. You will understand that many people are 
      living only fractions of lives.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
      color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>There is a sense of sadness 
      throughout in the failures of Willy, of his family. And what comes out 
      strongly is sexual failure: his own experience, his conviction that his 
      parents never achieved proper sexual experience. 
      </FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>You know we 
      are not responsible for what comes out in a book. We are not fully in 
      control of it. What comes over is probably quite different from what we 
      intend. I spent much more time working out the narrative very slowly, 
      almost picture by picture. Now that you've said that about the sex, I 
      suppose it is true. I think it probably reflects something in my own life, 
      a lack of sexual fulfilment until quite late. And then although sex may be 
      very prominent in this, as you've discovered, there is no absurd 
      description of sex at all.<BR><BR><B>Nothing that would qualify for the 
      'Bad Sex Prize'.</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>(Laughs) 
      Nothing like that. <BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>You've used four-letter words a few times, 
      which you've not done in previous books.</FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>I tried to leave them out and it looked 
      absurd, so I went back and spelt the word out. I made them say it as they 
      would say it. On the sexual theme, I think everybody's sexuality is very 
      important. Seduction is important, and the grossness of pornographic 
      writing annihilates the importance of it. It suggests that you just have 
      to deal with it in this gross way, and you've handled the matter. But it's 
      too profound to be dealt with in that way. In a way the physical 
      description of sex, which is what people go to the books for sometimes, is 
      very far from the difficulties of fulfilment.<BR><BR>My concern in the 
      book is also the historical side of things. Willy runs away from his 
      background, and even when he gets to Africa, this Portuguese province, he 
      is reminded of the background from which he came.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>We will return to 
      the new book later. Can we go back to when you started to write? You have 
      written about waiting for an agonising time before you knew what it was 
      you had to write. You describe the first sentence that came to you when 
      you were working in the Langham Hotel building of the BBC. It's from 
      </FONT></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2><B><I>Miguel 
      Street</I>. And yet that wasn't your first published book. Could you 
      clarify the chronology?</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>It's 
      actually an important question: it's part of the pain I suffered when I 
      was beginning. I wrote <I>Miguel Street</I> first, and it was taken by 
      Andrew Salkey, a friend, to André Deutsch. Diana Athill, the editor at 
      Deutsch, liked it, but André Deutsch, who knew about these things, said 
      'short stories don't sell'. And they kept the book for a long time. I had 
      little moments of terror, panic. They wanted a novel first, so I wrote 
      <I>The Mystic Masseur. </I>I finished it in January 1956. It should have 
      been published that year. To a destitute man it mattered to be published. 
      Of course you can't wait six months and then six months again. But <I>The 
      Mystic Masseur</I> wasn't published until May 1957, and then another 
      novel, and finally, in 1959, they published <I>Miguel Street</I>. The 
      stories, which had been written in 1955, have never been out of print; 
      they've made a fortune for André Deutsch. But look at the trouble they 
      gave me. The publishers could have eased my path a little, but they 
      didn't. It was the trouble I had with André Deutsch. He believed that only 
      one person's interest had to be served. But it must be said that at that 
      time, in 1955 or thereabouts, it would have been hard for my material to 
      be considered a real book by any London publisher. André Deutsch took it 
      up and I think it was because of Diana Athill. She was a remarkable 
      editor, she always softened the awfulness of the man 
      Deutsch.<BR><BR><B>You say softened - and you often use the word 'hard' in 
      your autobiographical pieces. You use the same word about your father and 
      his life and ambition. What does the word mean?</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
      color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 
      size=2>A very simple thing. Shall we say for my father it means - heaven 
      knows where the spark came from, in that plantation colony of Trinidad - 
      getting the wish to be a writer and not having anyone interested. To this 
      day they're not interested. I would say that my father's grandchildren are 
      not interested in his work. It's bitter, isn't it?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>Why was it 
      so?</FONT></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 
      size=2><B><BR></B>Well, my wife's daughter has recently been looking at 
      some of my father's writing. She's from Pakistan. She's enchanted by the 
      writing, because the people he was writing about are closer to the 
      subcontinent. That's one reason. And the other reason is that we come from 
      a peasant culture. It's not a literary culture. There's no tradition of 
      reading. There's sacred reading, there's reading of the epics, there's 
      reading of the scriptures on religious occasions. And there is an oddity, 
      then, in his ambition, that he should want to write when in his culture 
      there is no tradition of reading or writing.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>That becomes a 
      theme in </FONT></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 
      size=2><B><I>Mystic Masseur</I> doesn't it? The main character wants to 
      write and doesn't know what on earth to write about. So he reads all these 
      books, orders them by mail.</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>You know 
      the Masseur is slightly autobiographical, symbolically, because the wish 
      to be a writer represented my own wish. The hardness for me was actually 
      learning how to write.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 
      size=2><B>But the Masseur doesn't. His first book is a hundred questions 
      and answers about Hinduism.</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 
      size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>Yes. That's 
      his book. And the author of the book is wishing that it could be so easy 
      for him too. Actually I had an uncle who wrote a book like 
      that.</FONT><BR><FONT color=#000000><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>But 
      after these first few books you were well established, so it must have 
      been easier.</B></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>It didn't 
      feel easier even then. I was still poor. I mean actually destitute for a 
      very long time, and it was all made worse because I didn't see myself 
      becoming a writer, I didn't see how to move. People have said, looking at 
      the letters that were published two years ago, 'the writer was always 
      there'. But I think that becoming a writer means knowing exactly who you 
      are. Are you funny, are you grim? Are you heavy, are you light? You have 
      to know. In the beginning I tried to do farce. I began a novel in 1949, 
      when I was seventeen, and finished it at Oxford. I gave it to a friend and 
      he said cruelly it reminded him of Evelyn Waugh and he was 
      right.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT 
      color=#000000>What happened to that novel?</FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>Oh, nothing happened to it. Farce wasn't 
      right for me.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT 
      color=#000000>You never used it again?</FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>I'm sure I did. I may have used ideas and 
      bits. <I>The Mystic Masseur</I> had something of it. And I think the 
      African characters in <I>The Mimic Men</I> occurred 
      there.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT 
      color=#000000>Was the hardship of those early years something to do with 
      not having an assured audience? Because today an Indian writer, say, or a 
      black poet has an assured audience, at least amongst the 
      </FONT></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2><B><I>Guardian</I> 
      readership. When you set out there was no such audience 
      evident.</B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 size=2>I was 
      unaware of any audience here or elsewhere. I had never thought of the 
      problem of who would read the books. If I had thought of it, I probably 
      would have stopped writing. I didn't think of it like that. I believed in 
      the purity of literature. I believed that if one wrote, and one wrote 
      well, there would be readers.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>So you wrote, oblivious of whom you were 
      addressing? </FONT><BR></B></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#000000 
      size=2>No, not oblivious. Later, it began to wear me down, the fact that I 
      had no audience. I almost began to envy people who had a direct link with 
      a particular audience. I was always a foreigner: to use an American word, 
      I was always an import; so that was hard, and became harder as time went 
      on. In the beginning I was much simpler, I addressed my writing to one 
      person. I wrote for Pat, my wife. I read everything out to her. And then 
      sometimes I was also mentally addressing, in those early days, Francis 
      Wyndham or Diana Athill.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 
      size=2><B><FONT color=#000000>But don't you think success came, as you

      Minister of Trinidad. The Trinidadian government came to power in 1956 
      and, in this flush of wanting to be grand, gave me a scholarship to return 
      to Trinidad for six months. And when I was there Eric Williams invited me 
      to have lunch, and a very simple lunch as I remember - I think it was 
      plantains or something like that - and then raised this question, would I 
      travel and write a book about the colonial territories in the Caribbean? 
      The expenses were to be paid by them. I think I was required to hasten the 
      process of decolonisation. And because Williams had approached me, André 
      Deutsch had to publish the book. But the book I wrote as a result was 
      never acknowledged by Williams. <BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial

      explorations that you have undertaken among the new nations, 
      civilisations, awakenings of the twentieth century. This is the first real 
      book about the newly decolonised world and it's funny and full of 
      unexplored truths. How did you approach this task?</B></FONT><FONT

      travel for a book, I didn't know what to do. I enjoyed travelling, I 
      enjoyed going to Guyana and Surinam, finding a little hotel and staying in 
      it, seeing locals, going to dinner with people, and being invited. I 
      didn't know how to make a narrative of that. The making of the book is 
      more important sometimes to the writer than the things said. I thought I 
      was writing the obvious in <I>The Middle Passage</I>, and I dealt with the 
      problem of not knowing how to make a narrative of my travelling by being 
      autobiographical in one section, and then by following a politician, Dr 
      Cheddi Jagan of Guyana, in the second section. <BR><BR><B>But there were

      color=#000000 size=2>There are quotations in it from the Chancellor or the 
      Vice-Chancellor of the new University of the West Indies, who says: 'We 
      come from the Christian tradition or Judaeo-Christian heritage.' At the 
      time there was a belief in the Caribbean that they were a European people 
      and I was saying, you are Africans. And my stressing the fact that they

      truth was that I was shattered by India, by what I saw. The things I saw 
      just seemed to be repetitive, and I didn't think there was a book there. I 
      felt there wasn't a book in my travels. And for three months afterwards I 
      did nothing. I was faced with the possibility of having to give the £500 
      advance back to André Deutsch, so I wrote the book. What I did was I 
      opened an exercise book, and put down on two sheets all the things that 
      struck me, with little headings, and I looked at them; and I made a shape, 
      and more or less followed that shape. The book changes in mood and manner. 
      It's now writing about literature, it's now telling about the writer being 
      in Kashmir, it talks about arrival and then talks about visiting ancestral 
      villages - but that was the way it was done. <BR><BR></FONT><FONT

      talked about. Didn't that reaction come back to

      it says about caste is influenced by ideas I had picked up here, British

      the necessity of that in a big country. And the book was bad about Indian 
      art. I should have understood that art depends on patrons, and that in 
      Independent India, with the disappearance of Indian royal courts, the 
      possibility for art had been narrowed - instead of thinking that this was

      regarded in India as a provincial, even a fascist movement. You express 
      empathy and see them as the only party who care about hygiene, about 
      health, about the destitution of the slums in which they operate. The main 
      characteristic of the book is its urge to get under the surface of these 
      phenomena with a tremendous sympathy. It is the opposite of ideological.

      movements coming from below. I don't forget my peasant origins in this 
      way, and that we were unprotected, our family, people like us in Trinidad. 
      We had no voice. And in this way I'm quite different from Indian writers. 
      I'm different from Mr Nehru and people like Indira Gandhi. I don't think 
      those people ever knew the Indian peasantry. I think very few Indian 
      writers know or have a feel for their mentality and their lives even now. 
      They're middle-class chaps. But I came directly from the other. In spite 
      of the transplantation, my ancestors going to Trinidad, and in spite of 
      education, and being a writer and everything else - those are my origins 
      and perhaps this is why my sympathy is there. And I could always 
      understand them, the peasantry, the landless, the people below giving 
      themselves a break for the first time for centuries, perhaps even for a 
      millennium or more.<BR><BR>And that was the book in which I began to 
      understand the nature of the Indian calamity, what had happened to India: 
      and that was when I began to question, where I went against, the teaching 
      of the independence movement that spoke of the two cultures, the two 
      religions being one really - and I saw that India had been crushed by the 
      Muslims. I didn't see this clearly, I saw it later, but that book begins 
      to deal with that idea. And I think this is a book which only someone of 
      my background could write, because middle-class, self-deceiving Indian 
      people wouldn't think like that.<BR><BR><B>Underlying your observation of 
      India there is the historical perception that the Muslim rule of India 
      which spanned perhaps five or six centuries destroyed much of Hindu India. 
      The wounded civilisation is seen as a society which has been historically 
      mutated, truncated and damaged by proselytising and intolerant Islam. You 
      begin to see this in <I>India: A Wounded Civilization</I>.</B></FONT><FONT

      color=#000000 size=2>In my analysis of Narayan's novel at the beginning of 
      <I>India: A Wounded Civilization</I>, I think it's clearly stated about 
      the invaders. But Narayan speaks about the invaders in this general way, 
      and I suppose I myself was just dealing with the invaders in this general 
      way, not specifying or researching the acts of the Muslim conquerors, the 
      rulers and their governors. <BR><BR>The thing about being an Indian, and 
      it remains true of Indian writing now, is that it seems to work without 
      history, in a vacuum. Indian writers don't know why their country is in 
      such a mess. They can't understand the poverty of India, they don't know 
      why seventeenth- and eighteenth-century travellers talk of a derelict 
      countryside. Very easy to think that it might be because of the British, 
      but much easier in fact to pay no attention to it at all. This lack in 
      Indian writing, even in Narayan's writing, is a fatal flaw.<BR><BR>Narayan 
      grew up a day's journey from Hampi, where there are these extraordinary 
      ruins of the city of Vijayanagar, capital of the ancient Hindu kingdom, 
      which I went to see in 1962. And this destruction had been done in 1565. I 
      think a writer like Narayan should have understood what had happened, 
      especially as he'd written a guidebook to the area. But he didn't respond 
      to that. In a way perhaps the defeat had been too great. How can you write 
      about your setting, your culture, if you can't see what happened 400 years 
      ago? He has a really magical way of writing and looking, but his picture 
      is incomplete.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04

      theory of the progress of a myriad classes and kinds of people. And the 
      form is startling too. It is virtually a chain of biographies that define 
      the subcontinent, biographies of ordinary and extraordinary but neglected

      it makes a pattern. I remember when I began it I spent so many days in the 
      Taj Hotel in Bombay, wondering how to move. Where do you start? Then a 
      reporter, Laxman, a person I had been in touch with, began to understand 
      what I wanted, and he took me to the Shiv Sena, which had now become a 
      political force in Bombay. It was just one of these happy accidents, we 
      began like that. I talked to people who people would not have looked at 
      before. Indian writers wouldn't want the stories: they would do social 
      surveys about the very poor and the very wretched. And then I met a man 
      from the Atomic Energy Commission whose grandfather had been a priest in a 
      temple. So when I went down south I looked for this person, to understand 
      how over a couple of generations one can breed atomic scientists from 
      families steeped in ancient religion. I was interested in that sort of 
      discovery.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#ba2c04 size=2><B><FONT

      colonial rulers - you go and observe and write. Now for a writer to go 
      into that you must have some certainty about yourself, some certainty of

      two sides to the thing about Africa and about what I wrote. I had a great 
      interest - an ignorant interest, I should say as well - in African art. 
      And through that I have a feeling for the religions of the earth, if you 
      can call or classify African religions as that. They're so mysterious, and 
      really to me quite wonderful. The missionary who wants to convert them all 
      to a revealed religion is arrogant and destructive. I'm interested in this 
      ancient thing from the earth. Religious Africa. If one reads Virgil, there 
      is a lot of mystery about Rome, the founding of Rome, Roman religion, its 
      antiquity. And there is the same thing of course in this culture, African 
      culture, the dark continent. They come from very far back. They are very 
      mysterious things, I find these things wonderful. That was my initial 
      interest in Africa, a reason for going there.<BR><BR>But you asked about 
      this belief, the central belief, a moral scheme. When I began to write 
      years ago, you could have said: 'You are writing about these simple people 
      as though you knew a better world, and of course you don't, so why are you 
      writing like this?' My wife said this to me - she was not my wife in 1952, 
      she was a friend, a great encourager of my writing, but one vacation she 
      wrote me this letter. (I was reading the reply about two months ago, and 
      it remains true, although I was only nineteen then.) I said to her that I 
      believe in a kind of cumulative conscience of mankind. We all possess this

      believe that Trinidad had almost no history, that slavery had affected the 
      other islands but it hadn't affected Trinidad to any great extent. And I 
      went and found that it was not so. It had an awful story. I wrote it in 
      the way I did all my other writing - I attempted a narrative, I wrote 
      about people, a human story. I wasn't looking to make points about

      himself as a racial victim. And he found a lot of encouragers. He went out 
      to Trinidad and he was encouraged by all kinds of people there who looked 
      forward to him becoming the ruler of Trinidad, the leader of revolution

      and everything and did that story. And in doing it I learnt something 
      about people who support revolutions, and that was not greatly different

      journalism. But to write a work of fiction - it requires a different 
      approach. Yes, they are based on the same occurrence; but the books were 
      quite different to write. I spent a long time getting the fictional story

      you are not so secure you can't be entertained by murder, and in the

      very violent. I don't know where the violence came from. It's a kind of 
      moral violence as well, which began to creep up on people.

      think that the person on the outside has to consider it, and he will see 
      that fact and fiction are entirely separate creations. Fact has to be 
      scrupulously true to the reality, scrupulously. One must never tamper with 
      events or statements to make a story nicer. With fiction, one has been 
      given courage by what had happened to do this story of murder, and so all 
      the motivations for the murder have to be evident within this manufactured 
      story. It is not enough, in a work of the imagination, to say that X 
      decided to murder Y. You have in fiction to give an illusion of cause, an 
      illusion of a reason, so it requires another kind of narrative. In real

      disapproves. The story was given me to meditate on. I was able to add 
      knowledge of people I knew in many places, and the book came. The violence 
      actually is in the tone. If you read the book aloud you will see that it's 
      violent in its rhythm. It wasn't angry, it was just violent. The earlier 
      book, <I>In a Free State</I>, that is horribly violent. The violence runs 
      right through. It is full of humour, but every joke freezes. If you're 
      reading the book aloud to an audience, every time they start laughing the 
      laughter freezes, because what's happening is too awful. <I>Guerrillas</I>

      then what I did instinctively - not out of any deep plan - was that 
      different characters took on the story, so the story developed through 
      people, and each of the people became more important at different stages. 
      I remember I had spent about three months trying to write the book - it 
      was a very long time, it was my first book for three years, I was getting 
      very anxious. And I was in Wiltshire, in my cottage, and I began to rake 
      up the leaves one day; I'd tried so often to see the way ahead, and then I 
      saw the complete way the story had to be done, and I went back and gave up 
      the leaf-burning, and wrote out very quickly the briefest of notes, which

      order to be a writer, and has cheated himself and didn't see great 
      subjects - that's one story. And the other is a mock-pastoral story of the 
      English village in which he comes to rest when he's wounded and hurt. 
      There are many ironies in that story. He comes to rest on an estate owned 
      by a family with colonial interests; and, as time passes, England, the 
      country the writer has come to, changes. This place itself in which he's 
      come to rest begins to fade away. That's the way the book occurred to me.

      about the people he met and had explored them fully, whether that putative 
      book wouldn't have been more lasting than the stories, which have gone 
      with the wind now, and are part of the dust, part of the imperial dust. 
      Ten or twenty years later, it was all to collapse, and the Maugham stories 
      suggest a permanence, falsely suggest something eternal about the setting. 
      A real book about his observations would have been much more interesting 
      for us today. We'd have had a snapshot of Asia at a critical time. If he'd 
      been very fair with the material, and had asked the correct questions of 
      various people, we would have had a sense of China awakening, of Japan in 
      the distance, and India also. So it would have been more interesting than 
      these so-called 'universal' stories, which are not universal at all. They

      on, when he's 24, 25, 26, between <I>Sketches by Boz, The Pickwick Papers, 
      Oliver Twist</I>, and <I>Nicholas Nickleby</I> - these are the great 
      books. And <I>David Copperfield</I>. I know the academics love the dreary 
      ones, like <I>Bleak House</I> and <I>Dombey and Son,</I> etcetera, but 
      they can be pushed to one side. And terrible books like <I>Hard Times</I> 
      - a terrible book. But there is some kind of political angle to the 
      appreciation of that book. If you look at the dates of the writers I 
      mentioned, you'll find that the dates begin at 1834: that's when Balzac - 
      and then, shortly after, Dickens - began. Flaubert, 1857 - Madame Bovary. 
      Maupassant is later, in the 1880s. So in less than fifty years all the 
      great models have occurred, one after the other. It was an extraordinary 
      period in writing. I do not think there's ever been a period like that, 
      because this imaginative writing enabled people to possess their 
      societies. That's the most extraordinary gift that these writers gave 
      people - the ability to see their societies. In addition, you have, in 
      1861, du Chaillu, writing about travelling in Africa, and in 1864 or 
      thereabouts you have Speke, writing about his travels in Uganda. You have 
      Wallace, in Malaya.<BR><BR><B>Are they doing a new sort of travel

      Park</I> is a little earlier, but that was great too. I'm talking about 
      this period when knowledge of society and the world widens. It lasts a 
      short time. Du Chaillu, a very attractive writer - he's an American, in 
      spite of the name. And you must add there 1869 -<I> Mark Twain</I> and 
      <I>The Innocents Abroad</I>. And <I>Huckleberry Finn</I>, 1884, or was it 
      earlier? It's very special. It's a remarkable book. It cannot have a 
      sequel. It cannot be copied. The names I gave you are people who were 
      describing societies, big societies - France and America.<BR><BR>And I 
      should add, there's something very interesting in that flawed writer 
      Stendhal. In <I>The Red and the Black</I> his hero reads Rousseau's 
      <I>Confessions</I>. That book was finished in 1770, much earlier than the 
      period Stendhal was writing about, but his hero reads Rousseau to 
      understand society. So you see that serious function of writing at that 
      time. The writers today are copying the forms and yet their intention is 
      much more frivolous: to show off, to do a new kind of sensation, and above 
      all to tell people what they already know.<BR><BR>I talked earlier about 
      the official writers of Latin America. There are people who say, about the 
      problems of Latin America: our history is so bad we can only write about 
      it in a surrealist way. This, of course, is rubbish. Nothing is so bad 
      that mind cannot be brought to bear on it.<BR><BR><B>You said you were
