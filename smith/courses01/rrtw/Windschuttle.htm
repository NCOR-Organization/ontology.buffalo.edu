      <P><!-- Body of the piece begins below --><FONT size=+2>E</FONT>arly in 
      1998, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney staged an exhibition 
      entitled “Orientalism: From Delacroix to Klee.” It contained 124 paintings 
      and 50 photographs, most of which were produced by European artists in the 
      nineteenth century on subjects in North Africa and the Levant. In the 
      notes published in the exhibition catalogue, the aesthetic authority whose 
      name is mentioned most frequently is not, as one might expect, an art 
      critic, but the literary critic Edward Said. What the paintings confirmed, 
      patrons were told, was Said’s thesis about the “subtle and persistent 
      Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture” and 
      “the aggressiveness necessitated by the colonial expansion of the European 
      powers.” This endorsement was strong enough to create a queue of buyers at 
      the gallery bookshop, all eager to procure the prominently displayed, 
      recently revised Penguin edition of Said’s celebrated work, 
      <I>Orientalism.</I> <A name=back1></A><A 
      href="http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/17/jan99/said.htm#fn1">[1]</A> 
      <P>Some of these purchasers may well have been puzzled by the cover of 
      Said’s book, which features a reproduction of a painting by one of the 
      artists prominently featured in the exhibition, the Viennese-born, 
      Paris-based Ludwig Deutsch, who did most of his work between 1885 and 
      1905. Titled <I>A Guard with a Zither Player in an Interior</I>, the cover 
      picture is one of a series by Deutsch of scenes inside North African 
      palaces and harems. To the untutored eye, these paintings seem fabulous. 
      The architecture is sumptuous, the clothing and ornaments are rich and 
      lavish. The whole effect appears to be a highly romanticized celebration 
      of Islamic culture. Moreover, the Nubians standing guard at Deutsch’s 
      dwellings, like the black servant attending Delacroix’s <I>Women of 
      Algiers in their Apartment</I>, seem to be making a political point, 
      suggesting that it is their Arab masters who are the imperialists in 
      Africa. And yet the exhibition catalogue assures the spectator that this 
      uninformed impression must be naïve, because art critics who follow Said 
      have determined that these paintings are primarily a reflection of 
      European arrogance and Western prejudices: “the idea of Oriental decay, 
      the subjection of women, an unaccountable legal system—pictorial rhetoric 
      that served a subtle imperialist agenda.” 
      <P>Edward Said looms large over the current cultural landscape. The 
      influence of this American-Palestinian professor of literature is so great 
      that a remarkable number of commentaries about European art, literature, 
      cinema, music, and history now ritually genuflect to his ideas and to the 
      wider “postcolonial” critique they helped engender. Newspaper reviews of 
      performances of Verdi’s <I>Aida</I> now frequently feel bound to cite 
      Said’s opinion that the opera is “an imperial notion of the non-European 
      world.” Surveys of the American cinema now identify an Orientalist genre 
      that extends from <I>The Sheik</I> through <I>Casablanca</I> to <I>Raiders 
      of the Lost Ark.</I> In the prodigious new reference work <I>Companion to 
      Historiography</I>, edited by Michael Bentley, an entire chapter is 
      devoted to Said, giving him as much space as the whole corpus of ancient 
      Greek historians. Above all, he holds sway over the literary criticism of 
      the nineteenth-century novel. His most recent magnum opus, <I>Culture and 
      Imperialism</I> (1993), is a critique not only of those authors like 
      Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad who wrote about Europe’s colonies and 
      dependencies, but also of such quintessentially domestic writers as Jane 
      Austen and Charles Dickens. In the new Penguin Classics edition of 
      Austen’s <I>Mansfield Park</I>, the editor’s introduction approvingly 
      quotes Said’s explanation of the Bertram estate “as part of the structure 
      of an expanding imperialist venture,” and even the cover blurb feels 
      obliged to call attention to the introduction where “the family’s 
      investment in slavery and sugar is considered in a new postcolonial 
      light.” For analyses of this kind, <I>The New York Times</I> in September 
      1998 declared him “one of the most important literary critics alive.” 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he book that made Said famous was 
      <I>Orientalism</I>, published in 1978. This is a critique of the academic 
      field of Oriental Studies, which has been a scholarly pursuit at most of 
      the prestigious European universities for several centuries. Oriental 
      Studies is a composite area of scholarship comprising philology, 
      linguistics, ethnography, and the interpretation of culture through the 
      discovery, recovery, compilation, and translation of Oriental texts. Said 
      makes it clear that he is not attempting to cover the whole area. His 
      focus is on how English, French, and American scholars have approached the 
      Arab societies of North Africa and the Middle East. He has nothing on the 
      other areas that traditionally comprised the field such as Hebrew, 
      Persian, Turkish, Indian, and Far Eastern cultures, nor does he discuss 
      the attitudes of German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese 
      Orientalists. The period he covers is more restricted than the scholarly 
      field, too, extending only from the late eighteenth century to the 
      present, whereas European scholarship on the Orient dates back to the High 
      Middle Ages. Within his time frame, however, Said extends his examination 
      beyond the works of recognized Orientalist academics to take in 
      literature, journalism, travel books, and religious and philosophical 
      studies to produce a broadly historical and anthropological perspective. 
      <P>His book makes three major claims. The first is that Orientalism, 
      although purporting to be an objective, disinterested, and rather esoteric 
      field, in fact functioned to serve political ends. Orientalist scholarship 
      provided the means through which Europeans could take over Oriental lands. 
      Said is quite clear about the causal sequence: “Colonial rule was 
      justified in advance by Orientalism, rather than after the fact.” Imperial 
      administrators like Lord Curzon, a Viceroy of India, agreed that the 
      products of this scholarship—“our familiarity, not merely with the 
      languages of the people of the East but with their customs, their 
      feelings, their traditions, their history, and religion”—had provided “the 
      sole basis upon which we are likely to be able to maintain in the future 
      the position we have won.” In the late twentieth century, the field helps 
      preserve American power in the Middle East and defends what Said calls 
      “the Zionist invasion and colonization of Palestine.” Today, however, 
      there is much less interest in the traditional fields of philology and 
      literature. American academic centers for Middle Eastern studies are more 
      concerned with providing direct advice to the government on public policy. 
      Overall, Said submits, his work demonstrates “the metamorphosis of a 
      relatively innocuous philological subspecialty into a capacity for 
      managing political movements, administering colonies, making nearly 
      apocalyptic statements representing the White Man’s difficult civilizing 
      mission.” 
      <P>His second claim is that Orientalism helped define Europe’s self-image. 
      “It has less to do with the Orient than it does with ‘our’ world.” The 
      construction of identity in every age and every society, Said maintains, 
      involves establishing opposites and “Others.” This happens because “the 
      development and maintenance of every culture require the existence of 
      another different and competing <I>alter ego</I>.” Orientalism led the 
      West to see Islamic culture as static in both time and place, as “eternal, 
      uniform, and incapable of defining itself.” This gave Europe a sense of 
      its own cultural and intellectual superiority. The West consequently saw 
      itself as a dynamic, innovative, expanding culture, as well as “the 
      spectator, the judge and jury of every facet of Oriental behavior.” This 
      became part of its imperial conceit. In 1810, the French author 
      Chateaubriand called upon Europe to teach the Orient the meaning of 
      liberty which he, and everyone after him, believed the Orientals knew 
      nothing about. Said says he thereby provided the rationale for Western 
      imperialism, which could be described by its perpetrators not as a form of 
      conquest, but as the redemption of a degenerate world. 
      <P>Thirdly, Said argues that Orientalism has produced a false description 
      of Arabs and Islamic culture. This happened primarily because of the 
      essentialist nature of the enterprise—that is, the belief that it was 
      possible to define the essential qualities of Arab peoples and Islamic 
      culture. These qualities were seen in uniformly negative terms, he says. 
      The Orient was defined as a place isolated from the mainstream of human 
      progress in the sciences, arts, and commerce. Hence: “its sensuality, its 
      tendency to despotism, its aberrant mentality, its habit of inaccuracy, 
      its backwardness.” Where this approach first goes wrong, Said says, is in 
      its belief that there could be such a thing as <I>an</I> Islamic society, 
      <I>an</I> Arab mind, <I>an</I> Oriental psyche. No one today, he points 
      out, would dare talk about blacks or Jews using such essentialist clichés. 
      Where Orientalism goes even further astray, he claims, is its 
      anachronistic assumption that Islam has possessed a unity since the 
      seventh century, which can be read, via the Koran, into every facet of, 
      say, modern Egyptian or Algerian society. The notion that Muslims suffer 
      such a form of arrested development not only is false, he maintains, but 
      also ignores more recent and important influences such as the experience 
      of colonialism, imperialism, and, even, ordinary politics. 
      <P>The faults of Orientalism, moreover, have not been confined to analyses 
      of the Orient. Said claims there have been counterparts in “similar 
      knowledges” constructed about Native Americans and Africans where there is 
      a chronic tendency to deny, suppress, or distort their systems of thought 
      in order to maintain the fiction of scholarly disinterest. In other words, 
      Said presents his work not only as an examination of European attitudes to 
      Islam and the Arabs but also as a model for analysis of all Western 
      “discourses on the Other.” 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>his strategy has worked remarkably well. Today, 
      twenty years after his work was first published, Said is widely regarded 
      by students of literature and cultural studies as not only one of the 
      founders of the postcolonial movement in criticism and of multiculturalism 
      in politics, but still one of their chief gurus. This is despite the fact 
      that his work was not original, as Said himself acknowledges. It is a 
      synthesis and elaboration of two separate theses. One was an analysis that 
      emerged among a number of Muslim academics working in Europe in the 1960s. 
      Said cites the Coptic socialist author Anwar Abdel Malek, who wrote in 
      France using the then latest Parisian versions of Freudian and Marxist 
      theory. He accused the Orientalists of being “Europocentric,” of failing 
      to pay enough attention to Arab scholars like himself, of being obsessed 
      with the past, and of stamping all Orientals with “a constitutive 
      otherness, of an essentialist character.” This essentialist conception of 
      the peoples of the Orient, Abdel Malek wrote, expresses itself through an 
      “ethnist typology . . . and will soon proceed with it towards racism.” 
      <P>The other source of Said’s inspiration also derived from Paris in the 
      Sixties. This is the writing of Michel Foucault, especially his notion 
      that academic disciplines do not simply produce knowledge but also 
      generate power. Said uses Foucault to argue that Orientalism helped 
      produce European imperialism. “No more glaring parallel exists,” Said 
      says, “between power and knowledge in the modern history of philology than 
      in the case of Orientalism.” He also borrowed from Foucault the notion of 
      a “discourse,” the ideological framework within which scholarship takes 
      place. Within a discourse, all representations are tainted by the 
      language, culture, institutions, and political ambience of the 
      representer. Hence there can be no “truths,” Said argues, only formations 
      or deformations. No scholar or writer can rise above these limitations, 
      and even a towering figure like Louis Massignon, who dominated French 
      Orientalism until the 1960s, was no more than “a kind of system for 
      producing certain kinds of statements, disseminated into the large mass of 
      discursive formations that together make up the archive, or cultural 
      material of his time.” 
      <P>Said quickly assures us that putting it this way does not dehumanize 
      poor Louis. But what it does mean is that “every European, in what he 
      could say about the Orient, was consequently a racist, an imperialist, and 
      almost totally ethnocentric.” Note that this is not a contingent matter. 
      Said is not merely talking about what Europeans actually did say, but 
      rather what they possibly could say. In short, the prevailing discourse 
      renders Europeans, of necessity, racists. 
      <P>Before pointing out some of the problems with these arguments, it 
      should be acknowledged that Said does score a few hits. He shows that 
      there were plenty of nineteenth-century European travel writers and 
      journalists who visited the Orient and quickly developed an ill-informed 
      opinion of the Arabs and their religion. It is a surprise to find the 
      historians Leopold von Ranke and Jacob Burckhardt expressing some 
      agreement with such views. It is not so surprising to find genuine racists 
      of the period—like Joseph Arthur Gobineau, whose <I>Essay on the 
      Inequality of the Human Races</I> later provided the Nazis with a 
      rationale—espousing such views. 
      <P>Although Said makes excuses for him, one of the worst offenders in this 
      regard was plainly Karl Marx. Said cites the following passage: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>We must not forget that these idyllic village communities, 
        inoffensive though they may appear, had always been the solid foundation 
        of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within the 
        smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of 
        superstition, enslaving it beneath the traditional rules, depriving it 
        of all grandeur and historical energies. . . . England has to fulfill a 
        double mission in India: one destructive, the other regenerating—the 
        annihilation of the Asiatic society, and the laying of the material 
        foundations of Western society in Asia. </BLOCKQUOTE>But none of these 
      examples, nor indeed all of them combined, are sufficient to sustain 
      Said’s thesis. It is not difficult to show that each of his three main 
      claims about Orientalism is seriously flawed. 
      <P>For a start, he should have realized that Abdel Malek’s analysis of the 
      essentialist failings of Oriental scholarship and Foucault’s thesis that 
      knowledge always generates power are quite incompatible. If, as Malek and 
      Said claim, Orientalism’s picture of the Arabs is false, then it is 
      difficult to see how it could have been the source of the knowledge that 
      led to the European imperial domination of the region. According to Said, 
      Orientalist essentialism is not knowledge, but a series of beliefs that 
      are both distorted and out of date. Surely, though, if these beliefs are 
      wrong, they would have contributed to poor judgment, bad estimates, and 
      mistaken policies. Hence the political power of Western imperialism must 
      have been gained despite them, not because of them. 
      <P>In fact, Said’s whole attempt to identify Oriental Studies as a cause 
      of imperialism does not deserve to be taken seriously. The only plausible 
      connection he establishes between Oriental scholarship and imperialism is 
      the example of the Comte de Volney, who wrote two travel books on Syria 
      and Egypt in the 1780s suggesting that the decaying rule of the Ottoman 
      Empire in those countries made them ripe for political change. Napoleon 
      used Volney’s arguments to justify his brief, ill-fated expedition to 
      Egypt in 1798, though Volney himself was an opponent of French involvement 
      there. But nowhere else does Said provide an analysis of the thoughts and 
      reasons of the imperial decision-makers at the time they actually entered 
      upon Europe’s Oriental adventures. At most, Said establishes that 
      Orientalism provided the West with a command of Oriental languages and 
      culture, plus a background mindset that convinced it of its cultural and 
      technological advance over Islam. But these are far from sufficient causes 
      of imperial conquest since they explain neither motives, opportunities, 
      nor objectives. 
      <P>Said gives the impression of offering more when he cites speeches and 
      essays by Lord Cromer, Arthur Balfour, and Lord Curzon that paid some 
      recognition to the work of Orientalist scholarship in helping to manage 
      the Empire. But all of these quotations come from works written between 
      1908 and 1912, that is, more than twenty-five years after the peak of 
      Britain’s imperial expansion. Rather than expressing the aims and 
      objectives of potential imperial conquests, these speeches are ex post 
      facto justifications, sanctioned by hindsight. In Curzon’s case, the 
      speech, from which the extracts above are quoted, was given in the House 
      of Lords in 1909, four years after he returned from India. It was made to 
      support the funding of a new London school of Oriental Studies. He had 
      been recruited to the school’s founding committee and, not surprisingly, 
      was painting its prospects in the best light he could. 
      <P>Apart from Foucault’s grandiose hypothesis that knowledge always 
      generates power, Said provides no support at all for his contention that 
      “colonial rule was justified in advance by Orientalism” because he fails 
      to cite evidence about the actual causal sequence that led to the 
      annexation of any of the territories occupied by England or France in the 
      nineteenth century. Where real historians have attempted this, they have 
      come to quite different conclusions, with trade, investment, and military 
      causes predominating. The decisions of the British to move into North 
      Africa and the Middle East in the 1880s, for instance, were based on 
      rivalry with the French, the need to guarantee the sea routes to India and 
      China, and to protect British financial interests from nationalist 
      challenges after Egypt became bankrupt. Philology did not come into it. 
      Even Lenin has a more convincing explanation of imperialism than Said. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>S</FONT>aid’s inept handling of historical material is 
      evident throughout the book. He claims that, by the end of the seventeenth 
      century, Britain and France dominated the eastern Mediterranean, whereas 
      in reality the Levant was still controlled for the next hundred years by 
      the Ottomans, and British and French merchants could only land with the 
      permission of the Sultan. Said describes Egypt as a “colony” of Britain, 
      whereas the legal status of British occupation of Egypt was never more 
      than that of a protectorate. This is not merely a semantic difference 
      because a real colony, like Australia or Algeria, was a place where large 
      numbers of Europeans settled, which never happened in Egypt. Even on 
      Islamic history, Said is unreliable. He claims that Muslim armies 
      conquered Turkey before they took over North Africa. The facts are that 
      the Arabs invaded North Africa in the seventh century, but what is now 
      Turkey remained part of the Eastern Roman Empire and was a Christian 
      country until conquered by the Seljuk Turks late in the eleventh century. 
      The fact that these howlers have been preserved in the 1995 edition of the 
      book suggests that Said lacks friends, admirers, or advisers with 
      expertise in history who might have sent him a list of corrections. 
      <P>Said justifies his decision to omit German Orientalists from his 
      analysis by claiming that German scholars came to the field later than the 
      British and French, and merely elaborated on the work originally done by 
      their European rivals. This claim has generated considerable scorn among 
      contemporary Oriental scholars. Bernard Lewis argues that “at no time 
      before or after the imperial age did their [British and French] 
      contribution, in range, depth, or standard, match the achievement of the 
      great centers of Oriental studies in Germany and neighboring countries.” 
      To omit German scholarship in this way is like trying to do a survey of 
      the discipline of sociology without mentioning Weber, Simmel, or Tönnies. 
      It is quite clear, however, where Said derived the incentive for this 
      strategy. The Germans were prominent Orientalists, yet Germany never went 
      on to become an imperial power in any of the Oriental countries of North 
      Africa or the Middle East. For the Germans, knowledge did not generate 
      power in the way that Foucault’s theory said it should. So, rather than 
      admit this or try to explain it away, Said conveniently omits Germany from 
      his survey. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he second part of Said’s thesis has just as 
      little to recommend it. The notion that Western culture has needed an 
      “Other” to define its own identity derives from the structuralist version 
      of Freudian theory that became prominent in France in the 1960s. An 
      individual’s self-concept, this thesis maintains, emerges only when he 
      recognizes himself as separate from and different from others. Cultures 
      need to go through an analogous process, it is claimed, and so must 
      identify themselves through an alter ego. In other words, the need for an 
      “Other” is built into human nature at both the individual and collective 
      levels. This is a central concept of Said’s thesis but, unfortunately, it 
      leads him into a direct contradiction with one of his core methodological 
      dicta: his rejection of essentialism. In the afterword to the 1995 edition 
      of <I>Orientalism</I>, he complains that the book has been misread by 
      hostile critics as an essentialist polemic against Western civilization. 
      He says he would condemn any “attempt to force cultures and peoples into 
      separate and distinct breeds or essences. . . . This false position hides 
      historical change.” His own approach is “explicitly anti-essentialist.” It 
      is difficult, though, to reconcile this assertion with the way he 
      characterizes Western identity. He argues that, from its origins, the 
      West’s self-concept was defined by its opposition to Asia. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Consider first the demarcation between Orient and the West. 
        It already seems bold by the time of the <I>Iliad</I>. Two of the most 
        profoundly influential qualities associated with the East appear in 
        Aeschylus’s <I>The Persians</I>, the earliest Athenian play extant, and 
        in <I>The Bacchae</I> of Euripides, the very last one extant. . . . The 
        two aspects of the Orient that set it off from the West in this pair of 
        plays will remain essential motifs of European imaginative geography. A 
        line is drawn between two continents. Europe is powerful and articulate; 
        Asia is defeated and distant. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>These same motifs persist in Western culture, he claims, right down to 
      the modern period. This is a tradition that accommodates perspectives as 
      divergent as those of Aeschylus, Dante, Victor Hugo, and Karl Marx. 
      However, in describing “the essential motifs” of the European geographic 
      imagination that have persisted since ancient Greece, he is ascribing to 
      the West a coherent self-identity that has produced a specific set of 
      value judgments—“Europe is powerful and articulate: Asia is defeated and 
      distant”—that have remained constant for the past 2500 years. This is, of 
      course, nothing less than the use of the very notion of “essentialism” 
      that he elsewhere condemns so vigorously. In short, it is his own work 
      that is essentialist and ahistorical. He himself commits the very faults 
      he says are so objectionable in the work of Orientalists. 
      <P>The proposition that produces this contradiction is the claim that 
      every culture needs to be defined by an Other. This is not an historical 
      statement at all, but an epistemological assumption derived from 
      structuralist theory. It is now such a standard refrain within cultural 
      studies that it usually goes unquestioned. There is, however, very little 
      to recommend it. Although they have long distinguished themselves from the 
      barbarians of the world, Europeans do not primarily draw their identity 
      from comparisons with other cultures. Instead, identity comes from their 
      own heritage. Europeans identify themselves as joint heirs of classical 
      Greece and Christianity, each tempered by the fluxes of medieval 
      scholasticism, the Renaissance, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, 
      the Enlightenment, and modernism. In other words, Western identity is 
      overwhelmingly defined by historical references to its earlier selves, 
      rather than by geographical comparisons with others. To claim otherwise is 
      to deny the central thrust of Western education for the past one thousand 
      years. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he final component of Said’s thesis, the 
      allegedly false essentialism of Orientalism, not only contradicts his own 
      methodological assumptions, but is a curious argument in itself. Going 
      back to the origins of a culture to examine its founding principles is 
      hardly something to be condemned. This is especially so in the case of 
      Islam where the founding book, the Koran, is taken much more literally by 
      its adherents than the overt text of the Bible is taken by Christians 
      today. In several countries, the Koran is both a religious and legal text. 
      In others, like Egypt and Algeria, there are political movements prepared 
      to resort to terrorism to have it made the basis of national law and 
      authority. Moreover, one could not understand the most bitter division in 
      the modern Islamic world, that between Shi’ites and Sunnis, without 
      knowing its origins in the conflicts over succession after the death of 
      Muhammed in 632, any more than one could properly understand events in 
      contemporary Northern Ireland without some knowledge of the breach in the 
      Christian world that occurred during the Reformation. One Muslim critic, 
      Sadik Jalal al-’Azm, has argued that the kind of religious essentialism of 
      which Said indicts Orientalism is actually necessary to understand the 
      Muslim mind: 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>[I]t is true that in general the unseen is more immediate 
        and real to the common citizens of Cairo and Damascus than it is to the 
        present inhabitants of New York and Paris; it is true that religion 
        “means everything” to the life of the Moroccan peasants in a way that 
        must remain incomprehensible to present day American farmers. 
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Of course, Said would be right to complain were Western ideas 
      about Islamic peoples confined solely to stereotypes derived from their 
      founding texts and early history. But it is simply untrue that the whole 
      body of Oriental scholarship has made this kind of mistake. Take Said’s 
      claims about economic studies of Islamic countries. He condemns the work 
      of Western observers 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>whose economic ideas never extended beyond asserting the 
        Oriental’s fundamental incapacity for trade, commerce, and economic 
        rationality. In the Islamic field those clichés held good for literally 
        hundreds of years—until Maxime Rodinson’s important study <I>Islam and 
        Capitalism</I> appeared in 1966. </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>Anyone, however, who takes the trouble to read the one book he favors, 
      <I>Islam and Capitalism</I>, will find it actually tells a different 
      story. Rodinson is a Marxist sociologist and his work, like most in its 
      mold, is based on secondary sources. A large section of the book is a 
      debate with, and critique of, those Western economists and their Muslim 
      allies who do not, in fact, see the Arabs as having an inherent 
      “incapacity for trade,” but instead regard these societies as capable of 
      adopting capitalist commerce and industry. He discusses in some detail the 
      work of six economic commentators who expressed views of this kind between 
      the 1910s and the 1950s. Though Rodinson agrees there are many observers 
      who share the assumptions identified by Said, and though his main aim is 
      to see Islam adopt socialism, the evidence of his book is a clear 
      refutation of Said’s sweeping generalization about Orientalist economics. 
      In a later work, <I>Europe and the Mystique of Islam</I> (1987), Rodinson 
      dismisses the kind of homogeneity that Said wants to impose on Oriental 
      Studies, insisting that the field has always included “a multiplicity of 
      issues coming under the jurisdiction of many general disciplines.” 
      <P>Outside economic studies, Said’s claims about the essentialism of 
      Oriental Studies are just as misleading. Bernard Lewis has produced his 
      own survey of European attitudes towards Islam since the Middle Ages, 
      <I>Islam and the West</I> (1994). He argues that Europe’s initial 
      theological and ethnic prejudices had been largely overcome within serious 
      scholarship by the end of the eighteenth century when the study of Islam 
      was established as an academic subject worthy of attention and respect. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The Muslims were no longer seen purely in ethnic terms as 
        hostile tribes, but as the carriers of a distinctive religion and 
        civilization; their prophet was no longer a grotesque impostor or a 
        Christian heretic but the founder of an independent and historically 
        significant religious community. </BLOCKQUOTE>In other words, rather than 
      being necessarily ethnocentric and racist, Oriental Studies was one of the 
      first fields within European scholarship to overcome such prejudices and 
      to open the Western mind to the whole of humanity. 
      <P><FONT size=+2>A</FONT>lthough each of the three components of Said’s 
      thesis is therefore untenable, this is unlikely in the short term to 
      affect his status as an academic celebrity among students of literature 
      and cultural studies in the West. He is not only one of those writers who 
      helped create the current hegemony of identity-group politics and 
      multiculturalism within the university system, but is also one of its 
      chief beneficiaries. In accomplishing this, he has both endorsed the 
      prevailing cult of the victim, upon which identity-group politics are 
      based, and milked it himself to an indecent degree. “My own experiences of 
      these matters,” he says in <I>Orientalism</I>, “are in part what made me 
      write this book.” 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The life of an Arab Palestinian in the West, particularly in 
        America, is disheartening. There exists here an almost unanimous 
        consensus that politically he does not exist, and when it is allowed 
        that he does, it is either as a nuisance or as an Oriental. The web of 
        racism, cultural stereotypes, political imperialism, dehumanizing 
        ideology holding in the Arab or the Muslim is very strong indeed, and it 
        is this web which every Palestinian has come to feel as his uniquely 
        punishing destiny. </BLOCKQUOTE>Coming from any grown man, such wallowing 
      in victimhood would be bad enough, but from a tenured full professor at 
      Columbia University in New York City— that is, from one of the most 
      materially and occupationally privileged human beings on the planet, who 
      enjoys the added indulgence of being permitted to make whatever criticism 
      he fancies of the country that sustains him—it is simply embarrassing. It 
      certainly calls into question the judgment of his more ardent admirers, 
      especially Camille Paglia, who sees him as “an inspiring role model for a 
      younger generation of critics seeking for their cultural identity.” 
      <P>In the East, however, Said is regarded today in quite different terms. 
      While he acknowledges that translations of his book have won him support 
      among Islamic fundamentalists who see him documenting the violation of 
      Islam and the Arabs by a predatory West, he is much less of an influence 
      in other circles. He has had a highly publicized falling out with the 
      Palestine Liberation Organization, but a better indicator of the regard in 
      which he is widely held would be the notice taken of his views on his own 
      turf, as a cultural critic. It must be something of a disappointment to 
      him to see his analysis of the European arrogance and Western prejudices 
      purportedly built into Orientalist cultural artifacts being completely 
      ignored. For instance, at the time he wrote his book in the late 1970s, 
      about half of the nineteenth-century Orientalist art that was put to 
      auction in London and Paris was being bought by dealers for Arab clients 
      living in the West. Today, collectors of North African, Near and Middle 
      Eastern descent totally dominate the market for these paintings, with 
      Western and Japanese buyers all but priced out. Islamic collectors have 
      voted with their petrodollars. Palaces and mansions throughout North 
      Africa and the Persian Gulf are now liberally adorned with those same 
      portrayals of their culture by Delacroix, Ingres, Gérôme, Deutsch, and 
      others that Said and his followers claim are so demeaning. How could their 
      owners be so mistaken? The Moroccan curator Brahim Alaoui has explained 
      that, despite Said, the romantic portrayal of the nineteenth-century 
      Orient by European artists is now regarded as a valued part of Arab and 
      Islamic heritage. 
      <BLOCKQUOTE>That image of the Orient which set the Occident dreaming in 
        the nineteenth century returns something to those Orientals who also 
        seek an image of their past. They find in this painting a world on its 
        way to disappearing: this Orient that is highly colored, shimmering, 
        this Orient of arabesques, of costumes, and the richness of forms is in 
        the process of being eclipsed by a much more modern world. The image 
        that was fixed by the Occident in the nineteenth century—the Orientals 
        are now attempting to recover it. </BLOCKQUOTE><!-- Start footnote 1 --><!-- Notes start here -->
