<H2>The Lure of Syracuse</H2>
<H5>By <A href="http://www.nybooks.com/authors/66">Mark 
Lilla</A></H5><SMALL></SMALL>
<P>
<H3>1.</H3>
<P>When Plato set sail for Syracuse in 368 BC or so, he was, by his own report, 
of very mixed mind. He had visited that city once before when it was still ruled 
by the fearsome tyrant Dionysius the Elder, and the voluptuousness of Sicilian 
life did not appeal to him. How, he wondered, could young men learn to be 
moderate and just in a place where "happiness was held to consist in filling 
oneself full twice a day and never sleeping alone at night"? Such a city could 
never hope to escape the endless cycle of despotism and revolution.</P>
<P>So why return? As it happened, Plato did have a disciple in Sicily, whose 
soil was not as unforgiving as he had expected. A nobleman named Dion, who as a 
young man became devoted to Plato and the cause of philosophy, had just written 
him a letter reporting that Dionysius the Elder was dead and that his son, 
Dionysius the Younger, had taken command. Dion was both friend and 
brother-in-law to the younger Dionysius, and was convinced that the new ruler 
was open to philosophy and wished to be just. All he needed, in Dion's view, was 
to receive good instruction, which must come from Plato's own lips. He pleaded 
with his old teacher to visit, and Plato, overcoming serious misgivings, 
eventually set sail.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>It is an old myth about Plato that he was the proponent of a 
mad scheme to institute the rule of "philosopher-kings" in Greek cities, and 
that his "Sicilian adventure" was a first step toward realizing his ambition. 
When Martin Heidegger returned to teaching in 1934 after his shameful tenure as 
Nazi rector of Freiburg University, a now forgotten colleague, meaning to heap 
more shame on his head, quipped, "Back from Syracuse?" As a bon mot this can 
hardly be bettered. But Plato's aims could not have been more different from 
Heidegger's. As Plato recounts in his <I>Seventh Letter</I>, he once dreamed of 
entering political life but was disheartened by the tyrannical rule of the 
Thirty in Athens (404–403 BC). He then renounced politics altogether when the 
democratic regime that succeeded the Thirty put to death his friend and teacher 
Socrates. He concluded, much as the character Socrates concludes in Plato's 
<I>Republic</I>, that once a political regime is corrupt there is little one can 
do to restore it to health "without friends and associates"—that is, without 
those who are both philosophical friends of justice and loyal friends of the 
city. Short of a miracle, in which philosophers would become kings or kings 
would turn to philosophy, the most that can be hoped for in politics is the 
establishment of a moderate government under the stable rule of law.</P>
<P>Dion, however, was a spirited man on the lookout for miracles. He convinced 
himself, and then tried to convince Plato, that Dionysius could be that rare 
thing, a philosophical ruler. Plato had his doubts; though he trusted Dion's 
character he also knew that "young men are often apt to fall prey to sudden and 
often inconsistent impulses." Yet he also reasoned—or perhaps rationalized to 
himself—that were he not to seize this rare opportunity and make the effort of 
turning a living tyrant toward justice he could be accused of cowardice and 
disloyalty to philosophy. And so he agreed to go. </P>
<P>But the outcome of this second visit was not happy. It was only too clear 
that Dionysius longed to acquire a patina of learning but lacked the discipline 
and commitment needed to submit to dialectical argument and bring his life into 
line with its conclusions. (Plato compares him to a man who wants to be in the 
sun but only manages to get himself sunburned.) Just as a doctor cannot cure a 
patient against his will, so it proved impossible to bring the stubborn 
Dionysius to philosophy and justice. In their conversations Plato and Dion even 
appealed to the young tyrant's political ambitions, telling him that as a 
philosopher he would learn how to give good laws to the cities he conquered, 
thus acquiring their friendship, which he could then exploit to extend his 
kingdom further. To no avail. Turning his ear to slanderous rumor, Dionysius 
instead grew to suspect Dion of harboring political ambitions of his own and 
summarily banished him from Syracuse. When Plato failed to bring about a 
reconciliation between the former friends, he decided to leave.</P>
<P>Yet six or seven years later he returned, again at Dion's behest. Although 
Dion was still in exile he had heard that Dionysius had returned to the study of 
philosophy, and reported this to Plato. At first Plato was unmoved, knowing that 
"philosophy often has this sort of effect on young men" and suspecting that 
Dionysius only wished to quell the gossip that Plato had rejected him as 
unworthy. But, following the same line of reasoning that led him to make the 
second trip, Plato decided to make a third, his last. What he discovered on 
arrival was an even haughtier man who already considered himself a philosopher 
and reportedly had written a book, something Plato the dialectician steadfastly 
refused to do. The cause was lost, yet Plato blamed no one but himself: "I had 
no more reason to be angry with Dionysius than with myself and with those who 
constrained me to come." Dion was not so sanguine. Three years after Plato's 
final departure he attacked Syracuse with mercenaries and liberated the city, 
expelling Dionysius, but was himself betrayed and murdered three years later. 
After a series of violent coups Dionysius eventually regained the throne, only 
to be deposed by the army of Corinth, Syracuse's mother city. Dionysius survived 
and returned to Corinth, where it is said he finished his days running a school, 
teaching his doctrines.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Dionysius is our contemporary. Over the last century he has 
assumed many names: Lenin and Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini, Mao and Ho, Castro 
and Trujillo, Amin and Bokassa, Saddam and Khomeini, Ceau&euml;sescu and 
Milosevic—one's pen runs dry. In the nineteenth century optimistic souls could 
believe that tyranny was a thing of the past. After all, Europe had entered the 
modern age and everyone knew that complex modern societies, attached to secular, 
democratic values, simply could not be ruled by old-style despotic means. Modern 
societies might still be authoritarian, their bureaucracies cold and their 
workplaces cruel, but they could not be tyrannies in the sense that Syracuse 
was. Modernization would render the classical concept of tyranny obsolete, and 
as nations outside Europe modernized they, too, would enter the post-tyrannical 
future. We now know how wrong this was. The harems and food-tasters of ancient 
times are indeed gone but their places have been taken by propaganda ministers 
and revolutionary guards, drug barons and Swiss bankers. The tyrant has 
survived.</P>
<P>The problem of Dionysius is as old as creation. That of his intellectual 
partisans is new. As continental Europe gave birth to two great tyrannical 
systems in the twentieth century, communism and fascism, it also gave birth to a 
new social type, for which we need a new name: the philotyrannical intellectual. 
A few major thinkers of that period whose work is still meaningful for us today 
dared to serve the modern Dionysius openly in word and deed, and their cases are 
infamous: Martin Heidegger and Carl Schmitt in Nazi Germany, Georg Luk&aacute;cs in 
Hungary, perhaps a few others. A great many joined Fascist and Communist parties 
on both sides of the Iron Curtain, whether out of elective affinities or 
professional ambition, without taking great risks; a few played soldier for a 
time in the jungles and deserts of the third world. A surprising number were 
pilgrims to the new Syracuses being built in Moscow, Berlin, Hanoi, and Havana. 
These were the political voyeurs who made carefully choreographed tours of the 
tyrant's domains with return tickets in hand, admiring the collective farms, the 
tractor factories, the sugarcane groves, the schools, but somehow never visiting 
the prisons. </P>
<P>Mainly, though, European intellectuals stayed at their desks, visiting 
Syracuse only in their imaginations, developing interesting, sometimes brilliant 
ideas to explain away the sufferings of peoples whose eyes they would never 
meet. Distinguished professors, gifted poets, and influential journalists 
summoned their talents to convince all who would listen that modern tyrants were 
liberators and that their unconscionable crimes were noble, when seen in the 
proper perspective. Whoever takes it upon himself to write an honest 
intellectual history of twentieth-century Europe will need a strong stomach.</P>
<P>But he will need something more. He will need to overcome his disgust long 
enough to ponder the roots of this strange and puzzling phenomenon. What is it 
about the human mind that made the intellectual defense of tyranny possible in 
the twentieth century? How did the Western tradition of political thought, which 
begins with Plato's critique of tyranny in the <I>Republic</I> and his 
unsuccessful trips to Syracuse, reach the point where it became respectable to 
argue that tyranny was good, even beautiful? Our historian will need to pose 
these larger questions, for he will find himself dealing with a general 
phenomenon, not isolated cases of extravagant behavior. The Heidegger case is 
only the most dramatic twentieth-century example of how philosophy, the love of 
wisdom, declined into philotyranny within living memory.</P>
<H3>2.</H3>
<P>But where to begin? Our historian's first instinct may be to look to the 
history of ideas, on the assumption that intellectual philotyranny and modern 
tyrannical practices share common intellectual roots. He will find many learned 
investigations into the sources of modern political thought that share this 
assumption, and also share an approach, which is to divide the European 
intellectual tradition into rival tendencies and then brand one of them 
philotyrannical. A favorite target of such studies is the Enlightenment, which 
since the nineteenth century has been commonly portrayed as ripping the tangled 
roots of European society out of the loam of Christian religion and tradition, 
and encouraging cavalier experiments in reshaping society according to simple 
ideas of rational order.</P>
<P>According to this picture, the Enlightenment not only bred tyrannies, it was 
tyrannical in its very intellectual methods—absolutist, deterministic, 
inflexible, intolerant, unfeeling, arrogant, blind. This stream of adjectives is 
taken from the writings of Isaiah Berlin, who in a series of remarkably 
suggestive essays in intellectual history written in the postwar decades made 
the most sophisticated case thus far for blaming the theory and practice of 
modern tyranny on the <I>philosophes</I>. Berlin's main concern was the 
hostility to diversity and pluralism he discerned in a major current of the 
Western tradition that began with Plato and culminated intellectually in the 
Enlightenment, before bearing political fruit in twentieth-century 
totalitarianism. The cardinal assumptions of this stream of thought were that 
all moral and political questions have only one true answer, that those answers 
are accessible through reason, and that all such truths are necessarily 
compatible with one another. On these assumptions the gulags and death camps 
were built and defended. It was the Enlightenment that provided the ideal, in 
Berlin's words, "for which more human beings have, in our time, sacrificed 
themselves and others than, perhaps, for any other cause in human history." </P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>This seems a convincing story. The problem with it, as our 
historian will undoubtedly see, is that it conflicts with another seemingly 
convincing story told by intellectual historians that reaches a rather different 
verdict about the intellectual responsibility for modern tyranny. This second 
story focuses on religious impulses rather than philosophical concepts, on the 
force of the irrational in human life, not on the pretensions of reason; it 
offers, one might say, intellectual history as Dostoevsky might have written it, 
not Rousseau. In the decades immediately following World War II much attention 
was given to religious irrationalism by Western historians who perceived a link 
between the theory and practice of modern tyranny and religious phenomena such 
as mysticism, messianism, chiliasm, kabbalism, and apocalyptic thought more 
generally. What they saw at work in the minds of revolutionaries and commissars 
was an old, irrational urge to hasten the coming of the Kingdom of God in a 
profane world. In <I>The Pursuit of the Millennium</I> (1957) Norman Cohn laid 
solid historical foundations for this approach. He demonstrated how significant 
were the outbursts of revolutionary millenarianism and mystical anarchism in 
Europe between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries and then drew parallels 
between the eschatological fantasies of that period and those of the twentieth 
century. </P>
<P>In his studies <I>The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy</I> (1952) and 
<I>Political Messianism</I> (1960), the Israeli historian Jacob Talmon brought 
this approach closer to the present by arguing, against Isaiah Berlin, that the 
most significant feature of European political thought in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries was not its rationalism, which might have led it in a 
liberal direction, but rather the new religious fervor and messianic 
expectations with which modern democratic ideas became infused. In the frenzy of 
the French Revolution reason had ceased to be reasonable and democracy had 
become an ersatz religion for modern men bereft of traditional faith in the 
beyond. Only in these religious terms, Talmon thought, can we understand how the 
modern democratic ideal became a bloody tyrannical dream in the twentieth 
century. </P>
<P>Another apparently convincing story. But which of these two stories will our 
historian choose to tell? If he is like most historians, that may well depend on 
which intellectual and political aspects of modern tyranny he feels deserve our 
attention. If he is trying to understand exclusively the brutality of Soviet 
"planning," the Nazis' chillingly efficient program to exterminate the Jews, the 
methodical self-destruction of Cambodia, the programs of ideological 
indoctrination, the paranoid webs of informers and secret police—if he wants to 
explain how these tyrannical practices were conceived and defended, he might be 
tempted to blame a heartless intellectual rationalism that crushed all in its 
path. If, on the other hand, he is struck by the role in modern tyranny played 
by the idolization of blood and soil, the hysterical obsession with racial 
categories, the glorification of revolutionary violence as a purifying force, 
the cults of personality, and the orgiastic mass rallies, he will be tempted to 
say that reason collapsed before irrational passions that had migrated from 
religion to politics. And if our historian is more ambitious still, and wants to 
explain both classes of phenomena? At that point he will have to abandon the 
history of ideas.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>There is another way of investigating intellectual 
philotyranny, however. And that is to examine the social history of 
intellectuals in European political life, rather than the history of the ideas 
they held. Here, too, there are standard accounts that offer plausible 
explanations of philotyranny in the twentieth century. The most popular story is 
taken from the French experience. It begins with the Dreyfus Affair, which is 
portrayed by one and all as having expelled French intellectuals from the glades 
of <I>l'art pour l'art</I> and alerted them to their higher calling as moral 
watchmen over the modern state. The chapters that follow can be recited by every 
French schoolchild: the skirmishes between republican Dreyfusards and their 
Catholic-nationalist opponents; the splits over the Russian Revolution and the 
Popular Front after World War I; the intellectual and political compromises of 
Vichy; the dominance of Sartre's existential Marxism after the war; the sharp 
divisions among intellectuals over Algeria; the revival of left-radicalism after 
May '68; the <I>crise de conscience</I> after the publication of Solzhenitsyn's 
<I>Gulag Archipelago</I> in the 1970s, and the development of a 
liberal-republican consensus in the Mitterrand years. </P>
<P>The morals drawn from this story differ, however, depending on the political 
leanings of the narrator. As told by Jean-Paul Sartre this story became a heroic 
myth about the rise of the solitary "committed" intellectual who asserted his 
"singular universality" against the dominant ideology of bourgeois society and 
the tyrannical systems it had bred in Europe (fascism) and abroad (colonialism). 
In his influential <I>Plaidoyer pour les intellectuels</I>, texts of lectures 
given in 1965, Sartre portrayed the intellectual as a left-wing Jeanne d'Arc who 
stands for what is essentially human against the inhuman forces of economic and 
political "power," and also against those reactionary cultural forces, including 
traitorous fellow writers, whose work "objectively" supports the modern tyrant. 
</P>
<P>For his nemesis Raymond Aron it was precisely this simple-minded opposition 
of "humanity" to "power" that demonstrated the incapacity of French 
intellectuals since the Dreyfus Affair to understand the real challenges of 
twentieth-century European politics. In Aron's view, it was no accident, indeed 
it was utterly predictable, that Sartre's romantic ideal of commitment would 
turn him into a heartless apologist for Stalinism in the decade after World War 
II. In <I>L'Opium des intellectuels</I> (1955) Aron retold the story of the rise 
of the modern intellectual but with a decidedly antimythical intent, 
demonstrating how incompetent and naive the intellectuals as a class had been 
when it came to serious political matters. In his view, the real responsibility 
of European intellectuals after the war was to bring whatever expertise they had 
to bear on liberal-democratic politics and to maintain a sense of moral 
proportion in judging the relative injustices of different political systems—in 
short, to be independent spectators with a modest sense of their roles as 
citizens and opinion-makers. Sartre and his followers accepted no such 
responsibilities.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Aron was right: in France it was the romantic, "committed" 
intellectuals who served the cause of tyranny in the twentieth century. But in 
Germany, which Aron knew uncommonly well, the picture was quite different. There 
the problem was, precisely, political disengagement. For a variety of reasons 
that historians of Germany discuss—the tradition of political decentralization, 
the lack of a cultural capital, the ideal of spiritual inwardness 
(<I>Innerlichkeit</I>), the autonomy of the university system, innate 
conservatism, and respect for military authority—Germany never developed an 
intellectual class along French lines, and consequently the issue of political 
commitment did not arise in the same way. East of the Rhine the assumption in 
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had been that professors were 
engaged in timeless <I>Wissenschaft</I> in the secluded university, that writers 
pursued private <I>Bildung</I> as they wrote their works, and that only 
journalists dared to write about politics, and they were untrustworthy. </P>
<P>This was a myth, of course, but a very attractive one in modern German 
culture. Nowhere is this more evident than in Thomas Mann's <I>Reflections of an 
Unpolitical Man</I> (1918), an intensely personal work that was also Mann's most 
ferociously political. Targeting his left-wing brother Heinrich, Mann tried to 
puncture the pretensions of the French <I>Zivilisationsliterat</I> with his 
childish attachment to democracy and popular enlightenment. Mann defended the 
tradition of German <I>Innerlichkeit</I> on aesthetic and political grounds. 
"German tradition," he wrote, </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>is culture, soul, freedom, art and not civilization, society, 
  voting rights, and literature.... Opposed to French <I>raison</I> and 
  <I>esprit</I> is German <I>Innerlichkeit</I>, which guarantees that Germans 
  never elevate social problems above moral ones, above inner 
experience.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yet as he himself knew, and later came to regret, his principled 
"unpolitical" position carried great political meaning and served as a post hoc 
justification of German aims in World War I, encouraging the popular view that 
the Versailles peace was an act of cultural war. "This political spirit that is 
anti-German intellectually," he wrote, "is with logical necessity anti-German 
politically." </P>
<P>This was not the first time that an "unpolitical" German intellectual had 
made a disastrous political debut. At the creation of the Reich in 1871, at the 
outbreak of war in August 1914, and again in the Walpurgisnacht of 1933, scores 
of Germany's leading professors and writers engaged themselves foolishly and 
ignorantly in politics, whether on the paradoxical grounds of defending the 
"unpolitical" German tradition, or out of a sudden naive embrace of politics, 
whose ways they did not begin to understand (Heidegger foremost among them). 
Most concluded that their forays into politics had been errors and returned 
quickly to their studies and laboratories. </P>
<P>The philosopher Jürgen Habermas, in a number of important postwar writings on 
the German political and cultural situation, has argued that this was exactly 
the wrong lesson to draw from these mistakes. By withdrawing from modern 
politics on principle, German writers and thinkers since the early nineteenth 
century had become accustomed to living in a mythical intellectual world 
governed by fantasies about Hellas or the Teutonic forests, fantasies that made 
Nazi tyranny appear to some of them as the beginning of spiritual and cultural 
regeneration. In Habermas's view, only by descending from the magic mountains of 
<I>Wissenschaft</I> and <I>Bildung</I> into the flatlands of democratic 
political discourse could German intellectuals have been inoculated against this 
tyrannical temptation, and had they done so they then might have helped to 
construct the open public sphere Germany needed —culturally and politically.</P>
<P>Habermas's argument seems convincing. But if he is right to blame German 
philotyranny on political disengagement, and Aron is right to blame blind 
political commitment in France, where does that leave our poor historian? 
Obviously neither explanation makes sense for twentieth-century Europe as a 
whole. It appears that just as neither "rationalism" nor "irrationalism" in the 
history of ideas can explain the theory and practice of modern tyranny, both 
"commitment" and "disengagement" in the social history of intellectuals fail to 
take us to the heart of the matter. All these attitudes and tendencies obviously 
had their part in European history, whether as proximate causes or effects, but 
none tells us why intellectual philotyranny develops at all. At this point our 
historian, if he is still with us, may begin to despair. Perhaps he will begin 
to wonder if the answer to his historical question is to be found in history or 
must be sought elsewhere. That would be a productive wonder, for it might 
encourage him to reexamine the old story of Plato, Dion, and Dionysius from 
another angle, looking for clues about the deeper forces that draw the mind to 
tyranny.</P>
<H3>3.</H3>
<P>The most interesting fact about young Dionysius was that he was an 
intellectual. He may have been the first tyrant with such pretensions but he 
certainly was not the last. Today, in corners of left-leaning European 
bookshops, one can still find unwanted sets of Lenin's, Mao's, even Stalin's 
collected works, which were translated by propaganda bureaus in the Communist 
world and published by front organizations in the West. It may strike us as 
preposterous today that anyone would have felt the need to consult such works, 
or even to write them. But I doubt that Plato or Dion would have thought so. To 
judge by their actions in Syracuse, they understood that Dionysius' intellectual 
drive bore some important relation to his tyrannical political ambitions— hence 
their hope that by working a transformation on the former they could indirectly 
moderate the latter. In the event, that turned out to be impossible. Dionysius 
remained an immoderate glutton for second- and third-hand ideas, which he 
regurgitated in written works that made a hash of Plato's thought. But if Plato 
and Dion were mistaken in their hopes, they were not necessarily wrong in their 
assumptions about the psychological force that draws certain men to tyranny. It 
is the same force, Plato believed, that draws other men to philosophy. </P>
<P>That force is love, eros. For Plato, to be human is to be a striving 
creature, one who does not live simply to meet his most basic needs but is 
somehow driven to expand and sometimes elevate those needs, which then become 
new objects of striving. Why do humans "stretch" themselves in this way? For 
Plato this is a deep psychological question, one to which the characters in his 
dialogues offer many different answers. Perhaps the loveliest is that given by 
Diotima and reported by Socrates in the <I>Symposium</I>, that "all men are 
pregnant in respect to both body and soul." We are, or at least feel ourselves 
to be, incomplete creatures and cannot rest until some potential we sense within 
is made actual, until we can "beget in the beautiful," as she puts it. This 
yearning, this eros, is to be found within all our good and healthy desires, 
those of the flesh and those of the soul; some people experience mainly the 
former and satisfy themselves with their bodies, while those who have desiring 
souls become philosophers or poets, or concern themselves with "the right 
ordering of cities and households"—that is, with politics in the highest sense. 
Wherever we see human activity for the good, Diotima tells Socrates, there we 
will find traces of eros.</P>
<P>But what of activity directed toward what is bad for us or 
others—drunkenness, say, or cruelty? Are these also driven by eros? In the 
<I>Phaedrus</I> Plato leads us to think so when he has Socrates introduce a 
famous image of the soul that pictures it as a team of two winged horses driven 
by a charioteer. One of these horses is said to be noble and is drawn toward 
what is eternal and true, while the other horse is something of a brute, lacking 
in control and unable to distinguish higher things from lower ones; he wants 
them all. If the base horse is stronger than the noble one, Socrates suggests, 
the soul will stay close to earth, but if the noble horse is stronger, or the 
charioteer can aid him, the soul rises closer to eternal truth. All souls—and 
therefore all human types—can be found somewhere on this celestial path, some 
closer to earth, others to the heavens, depending on how their erotic horses 
have traveled. Socrates describes nine such souls, the highest one being that of 
philosophers and poets, the lowest one belonging to the tyrant.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Love wants the good but it can also unwittingly serve the bad, 
Socrates explains. That is because love induces madness, a blissful kind of 
madness we find hard to control, whether we are in love with another human being 
or with an idea. But the highest happiness can only be had if such madness is 
indeed mastered and we remain in charge of our souls, even as eros draws us 
upward. Such self-mastery in the face of love is what the philosophical life 
aims to provide. As Plato paints it, the philosophical life is not one of 
Buddhist self-renunciation, it is a controlled erotic life that hopes to attain 
what love unconsciously seeks: eternal truth, justice, beauty, wisdom. Few are 
capable of such a life, and most of those who aren't will gratify their 
yearnings in predictable ways and lead middling lives. Others, though, become 
utter slaves to their drives and nothing will control them. These people Plato 
calls tyrants. In the <I>Republic</I> the character Socrates describes the 
tyrannical soul as one in which the madness of love—"love has from old been 
called a tyrant"—drives all moderation out and sets itself up as ruler, turning 
the soul itself into "a tyranny established by love." The philosopher also knows 
the madness of love, the love of wisdom, but he does not relinquish his soul to 
it; he remains in control, governing himself. The tyrannical man is the mirror 
image of the philosopher: he is not the ruler of his aspirations and desires, he 
is a man possessed by love madness, the slave of its aspirations and desires, 
rather than their ruler.</P>
<P>As the conversation in the <I>Republic</I> unfolds we learn that there is a 
connection between tyranny in the mind and tyranny in political life. Some 
tyrannical souls become rulers of cities and nations, and when they do entire 
peoples are subjugated by the rulers' erotic madness. But such tyrants are rare 
and their grip on power is weak. There is another, more common class of 
tyrannical souls that Socrates considers, those who enter public life not as 
rulers, but as teachers, orators, poets—what today we would call intellectuals. 
These men can be dangerous, for they are "sunburned" by ideas. Like Dionysius, 
this kind of intellectual is passionate about the life of the mind, but unlike 
the philosopher he cannot master that passion; he dives headlong into political 
discussion, writing books, giving speeches, offering advice in a frenzy of 
activity that barely masks his incompetence and irresponsibility. Such men 
consider themselves to be independent minds, when the truth is that they are a 
herd driven by their inner demons and thirsty for the approval of a fickle 
public. Those who listen to such men, usually the young, may feel the stir of 
passion within; this feeling does them credit, for properly channeled it might 
bring honor to them and justice to their cities. But they are in need of an 
education in intellectual self-control if they are to turn that passion 
exclusively to good use.</P>
<P>Socrates understands this. These intellectuals, though, lack his humility and 
pedagogic care; their reputations depend on exciting passions, not channeling 
them. Socrates suggests that such intellectuals play an important role in 
driving democracies toward tyranny by whipping the minds of the young into a 
frenzy, until some of them, perhaps the most brilliant and courageous, take the 
step from thought to action and try to realize their tyrannical ambitions in 
politics. Then, gratified to see their own ideas take effect, these 
intellectuals become the tyrant's servile flatterers, composing "hymns to 
tyranny" once he is in power.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Socrates introduces the outrageous idea of philosopher-kings in 
the <I>Republic</I> to shake his interlocutors out of their complacency in 
thinking about this relationship between intellectuals and tyrants. The 
philosopher-king, were he to be born or bred, would abolish both. The 
philosopher-king is an "ideal," not in the modern sense of a legitimate object 
of thought demanding realization, but what Socrates calls a "dream" that serves 
to remind us how unlikely it is that the philosophical life and the demands of 
politics can ever be made to coincide. Reforming a tyranny may not be within our 
power, but the exercise of intellectual self-control always is. That is why the 
first responsibility of a philosopher who finds himself surrounded by political 
and intellectual corruption may be to withdraw. In the <I>Republic</I> Socrates 
likens the fate of a genuine philosopher in an imperfect city to "a human being 
who has fallen in with wild beasts and is neither willing to join them in doing 
injustice nor sufficient as one man to resist all the savage animals." Taking 
all this into the calculation, he keeps </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>quiet and minds his own business —as a man in a storm, when dust 
  and rain are blown about by the wind, stands aside under a little wall. Seeing 
  others filled with lawlessness, he is content if somehow he himself can live 
  his life here pure of injustice and unholy deeds, and take his leave from it 
  graciously and cheerfully with fair hope.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Does this mean that Plato imagined the philosophical life as one of complete 
disengagement? Hardly. After delivering his speech about the philosopher in the 
windstorm, the character Socrates goes on to say that such a man does not lead 
the best life, for only in a good city "will he himself grow more and save the 
common things along with the private." And, as we know, the real-life Socrates 
was put to death for fighting tyranny, not in its explicitly political 
manifestations but at its psychological source in the human mind. The 
philosophical life represented by Socrates' own was, above all, an 
antityrannical life, the noblest one because it is supremely self-aware of its 
own tyrannical inclinations. </P>
<P>That self-awareness is what distinguishes the behavior of Plato and Dion in 
Syracuse from that of the philotyrannical intellectuals in twentieth-century 
Europe. Because Plato and Dion had followed Socrates' example and uprooted all 
tyranny from their own souls, they were able to understand the nature of 
Dionysius' rule and were justified in trying to free Syracuse from his tyranny. 
Both hoped that, as an intellectual, Dionysius might be turned to philosophy and 
be made to see the injustice of his actions and the foolishness of his writings. 
Both hoped to combat tyranny with the word, not the sword. They failed, and 
though afterward their paths separated, Plato returning to Athens and Dion 
descending to the battlefield, Plato defended both their actions. He recognized 
that, as a citizen of Syracuse who loved his homeland, Dion may have let his 
hopes mislead him about the chances of converting Dionysius and that he felt 
obliged to take up arms once their efforts failed. But Plato was confident that 
Dion did all this without letting the tyranny he combated enter his soul. There 
is no shame in failure or death in politics, so long as one remains free of that 
tyranny. Dionysius could never understand this simple principle. He survived but 
lived in dishonor, while Dion died a glorious death, loyal to truth and his 
city. "For to meet whatever fate sends in the attempt to reach the highest for 
oneself and one's country is altogether right and glorious," Plato concludes, in 
final judgment on his friend's life.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>The lure of Syracuse is strong for any thinking man or woman, 
and that is as it should be. One need not accept Sartre's narcissistic myth of 
the intellectual as hero to see what Plato saw long ago: that there is some 
connection in the human mind between the yearning for truth and the desire to 
contribute to "the right ordering of cities and households." Yet precisely 
because Plato recognized this urge as an <I>urge</I>—as a drive that could 
become a reckless passion—he was alert to its destructive potential and 
concerned with harnessing it for a healthy intellectual and political life. One 
is tempted to say that it is this supreme self-awareness about how the mind 
handles ideas that distinguishes most fundamentally the philosopher in Plato's 
sense from so many modern intellectuals. And it is this same self-awareness that 
we would be wise to acquire in thinking about philotyranny in the twentieth 
century and learning from it.</P>
<P>It is difficult to think of a century in European history better designed 
than the last to excite the passions of the thinking mind and lead it to 
political disaster. The doctrines of communism and fascism, Marxism in all its 
baroque permutations, nationalism, <I>tiers-mondisme</I>—many inspired by a 
hatred of tyranny, all capable of inspiring hateful tyrants and blinding 
intellectuals to their crimes. It is possible to conceive of these tendencies as 
part of a grand historical narrative to which some external force, driving both 
events and their interpretations, can be ascribed. But no matter how much we 
reflect on such forces, we are still far from capturing the intimate struggles 
that European intellectuals had with them and the many ruses they employed to 
maintain their illusions. </P>
<P>As we read their works today and struggle to comprehend their actions, we 
need to get beyond our inner revulsion and confront the deeper <I>internal</I> 
forces at work in the philotyrannical mind—and, potentially, in our own. The 
ideologies of the twentieth century appealed to the vanity and raw ambition of 
certain intellectuals, but they also appealed, slyly and dishonestly, to the 
sense of justice and hatred of despotism that thinking itself seems to instill 
in us, and which, unmastered, can literally possess us. To those possessed, 
appeals to moderation and skepticism will appear cowardly and weak, which is why 
those rare European intellectuals who did invoke them—Aron was one—were subject 
to hateful attacks as traitors to their calling. Such men may not have been 
philosophers in the classical sense but they did display the same intellectual 
and political sang-froid that Plato thought distinguished the genuine 
philosopher from the irresponsible intellectual.</P>
<P>Hard cases make bad law, so the judges have decreed. Perhaps, then, we should 
turn a blind eye to the political mistakes of European intellectuals and try to 
understand them in light of the extreme circumstances of the twentieth century 
and hope for calmer days ahead. Our historian may feel this temptation acutely. 
But he would be mistaken to give in to it. Tyranny is not dead, not in politics 
and certainly not in our souls. The age of the master ideologies may be over, 
but so long as men and women think about politics— so long as there are thinking 
men and women at all—the temptation will be there to succumb to the allure of an 
idea, to allow passion to blind us to its tyrannical potential, and to abdicate 
our first responsibility, which is to master the tyrant within. </P>
<P>The events of the last century merely provided the occasion for extraordinary 
displays of intellectual philotyranny whose sources will not disappear in less 
extreme political circumstances, for they are part of the makeup of our souls. 
If our historian really wants to understand the <I>trahison des clercs</I>, that 
is where he, too, must look: within.</P><BR></DIV>
