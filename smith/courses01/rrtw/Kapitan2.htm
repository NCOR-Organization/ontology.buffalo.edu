<H3>1. INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P><BR>Much of the current political instability in the Middle East stems from 
the conflict between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. At issue is a struggle 
over territory, each group claiming possession of the region traditionally known 
as Palestine. The West is familiar with the vision of Palestine as a "promised" 
land with which Jews have maintained an association for over 3000 years, though 
Jews governed no portion of it from the time of the Roman conquest in 65 B.C. 
till 1948 when, through the success of the Zionist movement, the state of Israel 
was established. Yet the historical association of Palestinian Christians and 
Muslims to Palestine is equally deep, whether as the descendents of ancient 
Canaanites, Phoenicians, Jews, Philistines, or Arabs. Since the rise of Islam in 
the 7th Century A.D., Palestine had been part of the larger Islamic world under 
the rule of various Islamic governments, even though no independent sovereign 
Arab or Muslim state was ever established there. Moreover, the strategic 
location of Palestine makes it a vital land bridge linking the Asian and African 
portions of the Arab and Islamic worlds, favoring its political linkage to 
larger units. 
<P>Matters are complicated by the religious significance of Palestine to three 
major religious traditions, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic, each claiming 
descent from the monotheistic faith of Abraham. Religious sentiment generates a 
connection to territory that transcends purely legal and political concerns, and 
the intense emotional attachments to Palestine and Jerusalem have given the 
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians a significance far beyond that of 
usual regional disputes. As W. T. Stace wrote in 1947, the question of Palestine 
"is not an isolated issue. It touches the future of the whole world" (in Khalidi 
1971, 641). 
<P>The notion of <I>self-determination</I> has been invoked to shed light on the 
struggle. Some view it in terms of rival claims by distinct peoples, each 
wishing to determine its destiny in Palestine, thus, as a tragic clash between 
competing <I>rights</I> (e.g., Dinstein 1980, Gerner 1991).<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP> 
But not all find this image appealing. Apart from the members of each group who 
deny that the other has any rights of self-determination in Palestine at all, a 
construal of the conflict as a clash of competing rights of self-determination 
obscures its evolution while blocking proposals for its just solution. At best, 
it merely dramatizes the difficulty without resolving it. Still, the concept of 
self-determination remains relevant in understanding the critical historical and 
normative dimensions, for it is employed in justifying present hostilities, 
explaining present obligations, and proposing viable solutions. The following is 
an examination of its application to this very troublesome conflict. <BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>2. SELF-DETERMINATION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND MORALITY</H3>
<P><BR>There is a considerable debate about the status of self-determination in 
international law, a debate made even more timely by recent events in the post 
Cold War era, as various groups, peoples, nationalities, renew calls for 
self-determination within given territories. The unresolved questions are 
several (see Emerson 1971, Paust 1980, Pomerance 1984), including the following: 
What is self-determination? What is called for by a principle or right of 
self-determination? Is self-determination a right, a formative or directive 
principle to be used as a basis for establishing statutes, or a moral or 
political principle to be used in guiding debates over sovereignty in disputed 
territory? When, and to whom, does self-determination apply, that is, what are 
the proper units or beneficiaries of self-determination? What are the mechanisms 
for implementing self-determination? 
<P>The mere existence of a debate over self-determination does not diminish its 
normative or legal relevance; the concept has been prominent in efforts to 
secure lasting peace in the aftermaths of each of the world wars and in the 
subsequent breakup of European colonial empires. It is present in agreements 
having significance for international law, for example, in Article 1 of the 
United Nations Charter which calls upon member nations "to develop friendly 
relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and 
self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to 
strengthen universal peace." However, the exact status accorded 
self-determination by this terminology remains a matter of debate. That a right 
is recognized is indicated in the French version "du principe de l'égalité de 
droits des peuples et de leur droit à disposer d'eux-mêmes," which explicitly 
refers to a right (<I>droit</I>). Again, the language of "right" occurs in a 
number of General Assembly Resolutions, for example, in GA Res. 1514 of Dec. 14, 
1960 and GA Res. 2625 of Oct. 24, 1970, and, again, in Article 1 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights passed by the General 
Assembly on Dec. 16, 1966: 
<P>All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that 
<P>right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue 
<P>their economic, social, and cultural development. 
<P>While not all legal scholars take these provisions to settle the 
issue,<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP> 
it remains that post World War II diplomacy has repeatedly invoked the concept 
of self-determination to justify independence movements in regions which had 
previously been under foreign domination.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP> 
This is enough to establish its normative importance for international 
relations, if not its status as a <I>jus cogens</I> principle of international 
law.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP> 
<P>It is at the level of <I>moral</I> foundations for international law and 
diplomacy that our present discussion of self-determination is anchored.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP> 
The concern is not whether self-determination is enshrined in international law, 
and if so, how, nor whether a principle of self-determination has any effect on 
the actual policies and practices of nations. The issue is whether there is 
justification for taking some such principle as a normative basis for settling 
questions of international law and international relations. 
<P>Some preliminary problems must be taken up. Most directly, if 
self-determination is to involve a people's entitlement to political autonomy or 
popular sovereignty within a given territory, then at least three elements stand 
to be clarified: (i) the group of people in question, (ii) the territory at 
issue, and (iii) the connection that makes that group entitled to 
self-determination there. There is considerable vagueness on each account. For 
example, while some might think it easiest to first delineate the group in 
question, there is little agreement about the identifying criteria for the 
appropriate collectives, e.g., on what a "people" is (Emerson 1971, 462). If not 
defined in regional terms, then some sort of national, cultural, or linguistic 
similarities might seem relevant, but these are as vague as they are 
controversial (see Section 3 below). Perhaps all that is necessary is that 
members of the group share enough moral ideals that would sustain their 
adherence to the same political and legal institutions, thus, minimally, that 
the group possesses the potential for constituting a "politically coherent" 
community (Ofuatey-Kodjoe 1977, 156-9). Even if this could be determined, there 
remains the problem of fixing the region in which a community is entitlted to be 
self-determining. No precise individuating conditions for "territories" or 
"regions" have been agreed upon. Historical boundaries are no doubt important, 
as are geographic-economic considerations, but so are the historic and emotional 
attachments peoples have to given regions, including the aspirations of both the 
minorities which dominate sub-regions of a historically-recognized territories 
and the majorities which dominate larger regions within which these territories 
fall. Could these matters be settled, there is still the difficulty of 
determining the appropriate link of community to territory; it is fair enough to 
demand that the collective consist of established inhabitants or legitimate 
residents of the territory in question, but deciding who is a "legitimate 
resident" is a delicate matter, particularly concerning immigrants and those 
whose refugee status is not voluntary. Plainly, we do not yet have a precise 
formula for deciding when a given region or people is entitled to 
self-determination. 
<P>Illuminating algorithms are hard to come by, but some advance can be made by 
describing distinct, though overlapping, concepts of self-determination, each 
emphasizing different elements in the overall call for political autonomy or 
popular sovereignty. At least three different notions and correlated principles 
can be identified: 
<P><I>Regional Self-Determination</I> -- a demand that inhabitants of 
well-established regions, territories, or states be allowed to settle for 
themselves all questions of sovereignty over that territory, even if they should 
choose to be politically autonomous. Typically, regional self-determination is 
demanded when a territory is under foreign domination or, for one reason or 
another, unsettled or disputed, but it is also conceived as a continuing right 
of peoples within established state boundaries. 
<P><I>Democratic Self-Determination</I> -- the idea of self-government by 
popular consent, requiring that the inhabitants of a territory ought to be 
democratically self-governing or that the social and political institutions 
which regulate public life be established through broadly "democratic" 
procedures. Minimally, this requires that the institutions be both founded and 
sustained by democratic means, hence, by majority preference, though it is a 
further step to insist that these institutions themselves operate on democratic 
principles, thus, that a self-determining unit be a "democracy." Taking it, 
would mandate a democratic form of government in order for self-determination to 
be realized. 
<P><I>National Self-Determination</I> -- the conception that a nation or people 
has a right to constitute itself as an independent sovereign state, a view 
popularized under the 19th Century German socialists' call for the 
<I>Selbstbestimmungsrecht</I> (sovereign right) of peoples (Umozurike 1972, 3). 
At its crux is the concept of a "nation" or a "people," viz., a group whose 
members self-consciously share a cultural identity that is vital in determining 
the self-identity of each (Margalit and Raz 1990). Historically, this view has 
been used not only to justify the right of existing nation-states to determine 
their own form of government and destiny, but to pave the way for subordinate 
national groups to claim rights of secession from larger political unities. It 
also strengthened the call for cultural, ethnic, religious, and racial 
homogeneity within a state, as such, providing an atmosphere in which 20th 
Century nationalist movements could flourish. 
<P>Various combinations of these three conceptions yield still richer notions of 
self-determination, and there are elements in each in the relevant modern 
discussions. But it is important not to conflate them; none requires any one of 
the others. Arguably, democratic self-determination must be either regional or 
national, though the converse is not true. Nor is national self-determination 
necessarily regional; a call for self-determination of a certain national group 
in a territory might be quite oblivious to the interests of the established 
inhabitants of that territory. 
<P>A combination of regional and democratic self-determination -- 
self-government by the inhabitants of a territory through popular consent -- 
emerged as the important principle after World War I. Embedded within his vision 
of enduring world peace, President Woodrow Wilson felt its observance was a 
natural extension of democratic theory essential for both preventing future wars 
and "making the world safe for democracy": 
<P>. . . no peace can last, or ought to last, which does not recognize and 
accept the principle that governments derive all their just powers from the 
consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to hand peoples about 
from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property" (Pomerance 1976, 2). 
<P>He first employed the term 'self-determination' on February 11, 1918: 
"Peoples may now be dominated and governed only by their own consent. 
Self-determination is not a mere phrase. It is an imperative principle of 
action, which statesmen will henceforth ignore at their peril" (Temperley 1920, 
266). A more complete statement of the relevant principle came on July 4, 1918: 
<P>The settlement of every question, whether of territory, of sovereignty, of 
economic arrangement, or of political relationship upon the basis of the free 
acceptance of that settlement by the people immediately concerned and not upon 
the basis of the material interest or advantage of any other nation or people 
which may desire a different settlement for the sake of its own exterior 
influence or mastery. (Temperley 1920, 264-5) 
<P>It was in this form that Wilson's vision emerged as a "basic principle" for 
negotiations in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 (Temperley 1920, 266-268, 
357-364), despite the fact that neither the principle nor the term 
'self-determination' made their way into the Covenant of the League of Nations 
(Lansing 1921, 93-105). 
<P>Three aspects of Wilson's principle stand to be clarified before considering 
it as a possible cornerstone of international justice. First, while it does not 
obviously assert a universal <I>right</I> of self-determination, Wilson's 
normative language indicates that he conceived of the principle as a moral 
precept rooted in the long-standing ideal that political institutions gain 
legitimacy only from the consent of the governed. Here, the principle mirrors a 
good deal of Western political philosophy and indicates, at minimum, that 
Wilson's concept was one of <I>democratic</I> self-determination. Second, the 
wording in the last sentence of the second quote from Wilson suggests that the 
principle was also offered as a maxim of political prudence, one which should 
guide those "statesmen" entrusted with making decisions about the future status 
of given territories. Combining the moral and prudential in this way, the 
principle imposes an obligation upon any agent, whether a state, an institution, 
or an individual, which, by virtue of historic circumstance, has a voice in 
resolving an issue of sovereignty.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP> 
<P>Third, the Wilsonian principle was primarily intended for use in settling 
questions concerning the status of territories <I>unsettled</I> by conflict, or 
which are, or previously had been, under foreign domination. It was as such that 
the principle was utilized in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, though its 
application was contested precisely in certain "unsettled" regions, e.g., 
Alsace-Lorraine, Upper Silesia, and, as we shall see, Palestine. After World War 
II, it was in circumstances occasioned by international conflict and colonial 
breakup that the paradigmatic applications of the principle of 
self-determination occurred (see Espiell 1980, 46-48; Umozurike 1972, 14; 
Crawford 1979, 87-88). Thus, the Wilsonian concept is also one of 
<I>regional</I> self-determination. Indeed, there is reason to think that the 
regional concept prevails in international law, not the national concept, and 
that its most obvious relevance is to decisions about the political status of 
unsettled regions which are not yet self-governing or are in dispute, e.g., 
regions established under mandates and trusts (Crawford 1979, 84-106, and 
Ofuatey-Kodjoe 1977, chp. VII). 
<P>So understood, the principle of self-determination is to be invoked whenever 
there is a question about what political, economic, social, and cultural 
institutions are to prevail in a territory. Such a question is genuine when 
there is a potentially politically coherent community whose members are 
legitimate residents of a territory which either (i) is under the domination of 
a foreign community in a way that threatens the well-being and human rights of 
its members, (ii) was formerly dominated by another community but is currently 
free from that domination and not yet self-governing, or (iii) is currently 
under some form of internationally sanctioned trusteeship. The community of 
legitimate residents would then be the beneficiary of the principle's 
application. What the principle requires is that the said institutions be 
decided by the community in question, not by external communities, agencies, or 
nations. The preferred mechanisms for resolution are referenda, especially 
plebiscites, viz., community-wide votes on political proposals whose outcomes 
are determined by majority preference (see Cobban 1944; Johnson 1967; Umozurike 
1972; Farley 1986). 
<P>An argument for ranking the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination as a norm of international justice is available from 
prevailing philosophies of political legitimacy. It has become an increasingly 
dominant view that social, political, economic, and cultural institutions should 
be created and sustained through the preferences of the people whose lives they 
most immediately affect and, therefore, that the people be allowed to 
participate in the relevant decision-making processes that determine these 
institutions. By voluntarily binding themselves to a social-political 
arrangement, a people's commitment grounds a moral obligation to abide by its 
terms and, in this way, preferred institutions and their constitutive rules gain 
legitimacy. Settling a territorial dispute through self-determination increases 
chances that the arrangement will conform to what people perceive as just, if 
not to what is just, and thereby, enhance prospects for future stability, peace, 
and orderly development. By contrast, imposing an arrangement upon a people 
against their will creates resentment that is likely to nourish future 
instability. It is, thus, that observing self-determination -- whether as a 
political principle for solving conflicts over sovereignty, a legal right of 
peoples, or a human right of individuals (Chen 1976; Paust 1980, 8-9) -- has 
become the crucial mechanism for securing a people's recognition of a state 
apparatus established in a region within which they are entitled to 
self-determination. 
<P>Two final observations. While the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination imposes an obligation upon decision-makers, it also taken as 
conferring entitlement to self-determination upon deserving collectives. Such a 
"right," if this language is appropriate, should not be considered absolute 
(Emerson 1971, 466-7; Pomerance 1984, 332-7). There are independent 
considerations limiting how a people can exercize self-determination and checks 
upon the types of institutions they are entitled to establish. Certainly, the 
human rights of every inhabitant of the territory must be respected and 
legitimate minority interests taken into account, in which case, 
self-determination cannot be construed as a <I>carte blanche</I> for majorities 
to establish objectional forms of discrimination. Consequently, it does not 
provide the sole normative principle relevant to decisions concerning the 
political status of disputed territories.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP> 
<P>Finally, it is obvious that nations and diplomats do not always abide by 
recognized principles of international justice, no matter how entrenched they 
may be. But even if adherents of <I>realpolitick</I> are correct in holding that 
nations act only in regards to promoting their self-interest, unmoved by moral 
considerations, it remains that some standards of international behavior are 
universally welcomed as means for fostering cooperation and assuring a stable 
predictable international order and, thus, an orderly pursuit of self-interest. 
More impressively, international law itself is largely the creation of powerful 
nations seeking a viable framework for international stability within which 
justification for actions and policies can be sought. Recognized norms 
constitute a fabric of constraints regulating a wide variety of international 
transactions and conditioning the sorts of responses a country makes to 
perceived opportunities and provocations (Joyner 1988, 196). There have been 
widespread violations, to be sure, and perhaps there are intrinsic limits to the 
effectiveness of the prevailing norms, but as long as there is a need for any 
countries to achieve a <I>modus vivendi</I> with each other, normative proposals 
for achieving international order, e.g., that of self-determination, will retain 
their practical relevance.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP> 
<BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>3. NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION: A BRIEF DISCUSSION</H3>
<P><BR>Understood as calling for regional-democratic self-determination, the 
Wilsonian principle is restricted in its application to specific sorts of 
territories and communities; neither does it apply to all peoples or national 
groups, nor does it require recourse to plebiscite for all outstanding disputes 
about prevailing institutions in every territory (Crawford 1979, 101). It does 
not confer a right to national sovereignty upon all peoples, and even for those 
who satisfy the conditions of beneficiaries, there is no implication that an 
application of the principle is of overriding importance. 
<P>It may be asked, of course, whether there are also grounds for inclusion of a 
principle of <I>national</I> self-determination within a framework of 
international justice and moral decision-making. Margalit and Raz 1990 argue 
affirmatively, though the authors make no claims about its recognition in 
international law. Briefly, their argument is that since there is value to 
membership in a "self-encompassing" (national) group, including participation in 
the political activities of that group, then there is an inherent value in that 
group's being self-governing (Margalit and Raz 1990, 451, and see Chen 1976). A 
right to self-determination derives from this value (p. 456) and is possessed 
when the self-encompassing group (i) "forms a substantial majority in a 
territory," (ii) "the new state is likely to respect the fundamental interests 
of its inhabitants," and (iii) "that measures are adopted to prevent its 
creation from gravely damaging the just interests of other countries" (p. 457), 
in which case the right to self-determination is not unconditional (pp. 459-461) 

<P>That there is an inherent value in self-government cannot be disputed, but 
the restrictions on when this right is possessed, if ever, are perhaps more 
severe than Margalit and Raz recognize. Few regions of the world are culturally 
homogenous, and "unsettled" regions typically are not. Conscious national 
self-determination is likely to entail emergence of characteristic cultural 
values within political and legal institutions. This poses a threat to the 
interests and rights of minorities outside the predominant national majority 
within a territory -- it always has and it continues to do so as on-going 
disturbances in Africa, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union testify. 
Minorities resent not only the imposition of cultural values of majorities but 
the threat of such, for the establishment of political institutions to reflect 
the preferences of national groups poses a danger to their rights and interests. 
Even if assurances are given to protect the human rights of these minorities, 
international law has not evolved to the point where there are reliable 
mechanisms to ensure such protection. Finally, the threat of national 
determination to world peace must also be considered, not only because a 
proliferation of claims for self-determination threatens world order,<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP> 
but because the call for national self-determination has often been coupled with 
nationalistic chauvinism, persecution of minorities, and interstate 
belligerency, e.g., with Nazi Germany during World War II and, recently, in the 
Balkans.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP> 
In today's world, there is an increasing need for individuals to identify 
themselves as members of the global community, to work for the common interest, 
and to recognize that the world and its resources belong to peoples of diverse 
cultural backgrounds. Too frequently, the demand for national allegiance is 
exclusivist, pointing an individual in an opposite direction. 
<P>A right to national self-determination might seem appropriate in certain 
limited circumstances, viz., when the "nation" in question is an overwhelming 
majority and there are constitutional and international safeguards for 
protection of minority rights. But then, the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination, as delineated above, is itself sufficient to secure the same 
ends of self-government. Therefore, additional justification in terms of 
national self-determination is not only of dubious worth, as argued above, but, 
quite frankly, unnecessary. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<H3>4. SELF-DETERMINATION IN PALESTINE: 1918-1948</H3>&nbsp; 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The tragedy of the people of Palestine is that their country was 
  'given' by a foreign power to another people for the creation of a new 
state.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER>Bertrand Russell 1970</CENTER>
<P><BR><BR>
<P>In 1917-18, combined British and Arab forces ended over 400 years of Turkish 
administration in various parts of the Arab world, including Palestine. The 
nationalities in these territories, stated Wilson in his famous "Fourteen 
Points" speech of January 1917, "should be assured an undoubted security of life 
and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development." Yet nothing 
of the sort took place immediately; in the aftermath of World War I, the 
newly-formed League of Nations placed much of the region under mandatory rule by 
the British and French, Palestine going to the British.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP> 

<P>At that point, there was uncertainty in Western capitols about the precise 
borders of historic Palestine. It was generally agreed that the region extended 
at least to the Mediterranean on the west, the Jordan River on the east, the 
southern Golan Heights in the northeast, and the Negev and Sinai deserts in the 
south, but there was dispute concerning the northern and eastern borders, fueled 
partly by Zionist aspirations.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP> 
The area mentioned, including the Negev, was classified as 'Palestine' by the 
terms of the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine granted to the British in 
1922. There were some 800,000 inhabitants in that region by 1918, Arabs 
outnumbering Jews ten to one. Ownership of approximately half of the land was in 
private Arab hands, 2.6% was privately owned by Jews, while the remainder was 
State property under the Ottoman law, though much of it had been farmed by 
generations of Arab villagers. 
<P>Given the general acceptance of Wilson's principle, it would seem that 
Palestine, either in itself or as part of a larger geographical unit, was a 
region to which regional-democratic self-determination should have been applied. 
Despite Arab expectations, this never occurred. Two political decisions 
intervened, one by the British in 1917 and another by the Americans in 1946, 
both eventuating in actions taken by international bodies which entailed a 
denial of self-determination in Palestine. This assessment has been well-argued 
in Cattan 1976, Bassouni 1978, Mallison 1986, and Quigley 1990. Here some 
features will be highlighted. 
<P>During World War I, Britain promised its Arab allies independence throughout 
the territory liberated from the Turks,<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP> 
but also signed two other agreements which embodied contrary policies. In 1916, 
Great Britain and France concluded the Sykes-Picot agreement by which the Arab 
Middle East would be divided up into regions of British and French influence 
under the sovereignty of those powers, with Palestine placed under some form of 
international administration. This was soon superseded by a more momentous 
decision; in 1917, the wartime British government under David Lloyd George 
issued the <I>Balfour Declaration</I> declaring British policy to establish a 
"national home" for the Jewish people in Palestine. The Declaration was the 
first significant victory for the Zionist movement initiated in the late 19th 
Century. Under the persuasive and careful diplomacy of its chief spokesman, 
Chaim Weizmann, the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, issued the 
declaration in a letter of November 2, 1917 to Lord Rothschild: 
<P>'His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of 
a national home for the Jewish people, and will use the best endeavours to 
facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that 
nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the 
existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political staus 
enjoyed by Jews in any other country.' (Mallison 1986, 427-9) 
<P>In one stroke, Palestine, a land which had been peopled by an Arab majority 
for centuries, was now promised by a European power to the Jewish people; not to 
the established Jewish minority in Palestine, but to the Jewish people <I>per 
se</I>. Although the crucial phrases 'civil and religious rights' and 'political 
status' were left undefined by the Declaration, it is significant that the 
document contrasted civil rights with political status while avoiding reference 
to the political status of Palestinian Arabs, viz., the "non-Jewish communities" 
which comprised the substantial majority of inhabitants.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP> 

<P>The principle of self-determination was ignored here; the largest segment of 
Palestine's inhabitants did not participate in the making of a decision which 
was to have a monumental impact upon their future. They were not consulted; no 
referendum, no plebiscite, was ever held, no approval from Palestinian 
representatives ever secured. To the contrary, they adamently opposed it and 
repeatedly voiced their opposition, e.g., as early as 1919 (Khalidi 1971, 
213-21). Again, in 1925, shortly after the Balfour Declaration had been 
incorporated into the terms of the 1922 Mandate for Palestine, the international 
lawyer, Quincey Wright, reported that Palestinian Arabs viewed the Declaration 
as a political decision constituting "a gross violation of the principle of 
self-determination proclaimed by the Allies" (Quigley 1990, 18). The governments 
of the United States and Great Britain were apprised of the situation in 
Palestine and fully informed of Arab opposition to the Balfour Declaration. In 
1919, President Wilson dispatched a commission to the Near East to report on the 
political situation there. In its report to the Paris Peace Conference on August 
28, 1919, the commissioners, Dr. King and Mr. Crane, expressed concern about the 
future of Palestine, claiming that if the principle of self-determination is to 
rule, 
<P>. . . then it is to be remembered that the non-Jewish population of Palestine 
-- nearly 9/10 of the whole -- are emphatically against the entire Zionist 
programme. The tables show that there was no one thing upon which the population 
of Palestine were more agreed than upon this. To subject a people so minded to 
unlimited Jewish immigration, and to steady financial and social pressure to 
surrender the land, would be a gross violation of the principle just quoted, and 
of the people's rights, though it kept within the forms of law.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP> 

<P>The commissioners also noted that none of the British officers consulted felt 
that a Jewish National Home could not be established except by the force of 
arms. Finally, citing Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant (see note 
11), their report indicated that the inhabitants preferred that the mandate for 
all Syria (including Palestine) go to the United States. 
<P>But the recommendations of the King-Crane Commission fell on deaf ears. They 
became no part of the policy of either the United States or Great Britain, and 
they were ignored by the League of Nations committees which drew up the terms of 
the mandates. In March 1919, and again in April 1919, Wilson reiterated his 
earlier approval (October 1917) of the Balfour Declaration (Lilienthal 1982, 30; 
Heckscher 1991, 340), and in 1922 the U.S. Congress concurred (Stone 1981, 
151-2). Wilson was apparently not pressed upon the apparent conflict of this 
vision with his principle of self-determination (see Khalidi 1971, xxxii; 
Lansing 1921, 104-5), and the British took the view that he fully supported 
Zionism (Lloyd George 1939, 734-5). The British Government had already ruled out 
settlement of the Palestine question by appeal to the principle of 
self-determination. Lord Balfour was particularly blunt: 
<P>. . . in Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of 
consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country . . . The Four 
Great Powers are committed to Zionism. And Zionism, be it right or wrong, goood 
or bad, is rooted in agelong traditions, in present needs, in future hopes, of 
far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who 
now inhabit that ancient land. (Khalidi 1971, 208) 
<P>An official memorandum of the British Foreign Office Department to the 
British Cabinet contained an equally explicit suspension of the principle: 
<P>The problem of Palestine cannot be exclusively solved on the principle of 
self-determination, because there is one element in the population -- the Jews 
-- which, for historical and religious reasons, is entitled to a greater 
influence than would be given to it if numbers were the sole test. (Lloyd George 
1939, 750) 
<P>These statements foreshadowed subsequent British policy. No mention of 
self-determination was made in the terms of the Mandate for Palestine and, 
against the wishes of the Arab majority, the gates of Palestine were opened to 
Jewish immigration so that by 1931 the Jews constituted 16% of the total 
population, and by 1936, 28%. Even at the height of World War II in 1942, 
Winston Churchill, echoing the sentiments of Balfour and Lloyd George, expressed 
concern about the self-determination clause of the Atlantic Charter since it 
might obstruct Zionist settlement in Palestine (letter to President Franklin 
Roosevelt, quoted in Khalidi 1971, 49). By 1947, Jews constituted roughly 
one-third of the Palestine's population of approximately 1.9 million people, "by 
the might of England, against the will of the people" (Toynbee 1954, 306). 
Despite explicit assurances from Zionist leaders like Weizmann that Jews had no 
intention of turning the Arabs out of their homes, Zionist political rhetoric in 
the streets and exclusivist policies on Jewish-owned land revealed other 
intentions. Only when Arabs resorted to armed insurrection against the British 
in 1936-1938 did the Government change its policy. In the 1939 MacDonald White 
Paper, Britain renounced the Balfour Declaration and declared a new policy of 
advocating a singular secular state throughout Palestine (Khalidi 1971, 461-75). 
This met with approval among many Arabs (though not all), but was angrily 
rejected by the Zionist movement (Hirst 1984, 96-7, and see Gal 1991). With the 
onset of the Second World War, the latter began to concentrate its diplomatic 
efforts upon the United States. 
<P>In the aftermath of World War II, a weakened Great Britain thrust the issue 
of Palestine onto the lap of the newly formed United Nations. Western opinion 
was now more favorably disposed towards Zionist aspirations as the facts of Nazi 
persecution and genocide of European Jews became clear. In the most significant 
political victory for Zionism since the Balfour Declaration, President Truman 
endorsed Zionist proposals in August 1946 (Khalidi 1971, lxiv), setting in 
motion American diplomatic efforts to secure a partition of Palestine into a 
Jewish and an Arab state. In September of 1947, the UN Special Committee on 
Palestine (UNSCOP) acknowledged that the League of Nations Mandate had violated 
the Palestinian Arabs right of self-determination and that the creation of a 
Jewish National Home in Palestine "ran counter" to the principle of 
self-determination (Quigley 1990, 33).<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP> 
But prevailing political opinion, particularly in the United States and USSR, 
pushed the General Assembly to recommend partition of Palestine into Jewish and 
Arab states with Jerusalem placed under an international trusteeship (Resolution 
181 of November 29, 1947). While Great Britain abstained in the voting, the 
United States led the fight for approval, resorting to pressure diplomacy to 
secure the necessary votes (Khalidi 1971, 709-30). Officially, the Jewish Agency 
(the political arm of the Zionist movement in Palestine) accepted the 
recommendations of the partition plan; Arabs overwhelmingly rejected its 
provisions as constituting a gross violation of the rights of the Arab majority 
in Palestine. It is, as some describe it, the "original sin" which "underlies 
the entire Palestine conflict" (Lilienthal 1982, 97). 
<P>In the subsequent violence of 1948-1949, Jewish military organizations 
outnumbered and outgunned the disorganized Palestinian forces and their Arab 
allies (Khalidi 1971, 861-71). Massacres, like those that took place at the Arab 
village of Deir Yassin in early April 1948, caused thousands of Arabs to flee 
from their homes in fear of a similar fate (Hirst 1984, 123-9; Khalidi 1971, 
761-6, 795-806). Outright expulsion was employed by the Israeli forces in other 
cases, e.g., in Lydda, Ramleh, Haifa, and parts of the Galilee region (Flapan 
1986; Morris 1988). Self-determination took on a new meaning, with the gun 
rather than the ballot box as its principal instrument. By the time a cease-fire 
was finalized in 1949, over 800,000 Arabs fled or were driven from their homes, 
villages, and towns, and Israel came into possession of 77% of mandated 
Palestine. The refugees were never permitted to return to their homes which, in 
many cases, no longer exist, since Israel has destroyed 385 Arab villages 
(Lilienthal 1982, 159). Today, they and their descendents number over 3 million, 
and on land that was once theirs, Jewish immigrants from Europe and other parts 
of the Middle East, are settled. Chaim Weizmann, who had earlier assured the 
Arabs of Jaffa that it had never been anybody's intention "to turn anyone out of 
his property" now proclaimed that the events of 1948 constituted "a miraculous 
clearing of the land: the miraculous simplification of Israel's task" (Hirst 
1984, 143). Here, then, the seeds of violence in the Middle East took root and 
germinated. 
<P>Let us conclude with these obsevations. After World War II, the Atlantic 
Charter and UN Charter made the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination a clearly acknowledged norm of international diplomacy, and 
there are powerful arguments that it existed as a norm of international law by 
the time of the UN Resolution 181 in 1947 (Quigley 1990; Bassouni 1978; Cattan 
1976; and Mallison 1986). With UN Resolution 181, however, Palestinian Arabs 
were denied input into the decision-making process that would determine their 
fate, despite the fact that by 1947 they still outnumbered Jews by a two to one 
ratio. Although Jews owned only about 6% of Palestine, nearly 56% of the 
territory was alloted to the proposed Jewish state, while the Arab state was to 
be established on 43.7%, the remainder being in Jerusalem. Adherence to the 
concept of regional-democratic self-determination would have called for a 
plebiscite on the partition proposal. As it was, Resolution 181, the 
establishment of Israel on May 14, 1948, the subsequent violence and refusal of 
repatriation, constituted an unmistakeable denial of self-determination for the 
Arab residents of Palestine. 
<P>Some have tried to justify Resolution 181 by claiming that the Jewish 
inhabitants of Palestine secured self-determination (Stone 1981, 14-15) and, 
indeed, that the very existence of a democratic Israel represents a paradigmatic 
exercise of that right. Yet however strong the case for a Jewish state was in 
1947, it could not be anchored on the type of self-determination discussed 
above, viz., regional-democratic self-government. The Jews lacked a majority in 
Palestine in 1947; over half of the 650,00 Jews in Palestine had immigrated 
since 1920, at least 10% classified as "illegals" by the British authorities 
(Anglo-American Survey: Supplement 1947, 17-23). Hence, the Zionist claim to be 
exercising a right to self-determination <I>in 1947-48</I> could only reduce to 
a plea for self-government by a specific national group within a certain 
territory, that is, for <I>national</I> self-determination. The existence of 
such a right is questionable (as argued in Section 3), but even if it did exist, 
the belief that it would override the call for regional-democratic 
self-determination is an implausible repudiation of the Wilsonian 
principle.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP> 

<P>Finally, considering the demographic, historic, and legal circumstances 
prevailing in 1947-48, Arab Palestinians cannot be faulted for failing at that 
time to recognize another people's claim for nationhood in a territory which 
they (the Palestinians) regarded as their own. Given standing international 
norms, Palestinians, and Arabs in general, were under no obligation to either 
accept Resolution 181 or to recognize the state of Israel. How could they? The 
imposition of Israel was not only against their will, it defied all standards of 
international behavior in directly assaulting their rights to land, homes, and 
heritage in their traditional domain. On this score, David Ben-Gurion, Israel's 
first Prime Minister, was candid: 
<P>Why should the Arabs make peace? If I was an Arab leader I would never make 
terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country. . . . Why 
should they accept that? (quoted in Goldmann 1978, 99). <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>5. A CONTINUED DENIAL OF SELF-DETERMINATION: 1948-1992</B> 
<P>In the years since Israel's declaration of statehood, Israeli Jews have 
enjoyed a considerable measure of self-determination: they have constituted 
themselves as a nation-state, are self-governing in the territory controlled by 
that state, and enjoy democratic rights of political participation. At the same 
time, the vast majority of Palestinians have been denied the most elemental form 
of self-determination by being excluded from the negotiations that have taken 
place to resolve the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, not only those in areas under 
Israel's control, but also those in the surrounding Arab countries to which the 
Palestinians fled or were expelled in 1947-48. This denial has persisted despite 
numerous resolutions by the UN General Assembly that the right of 
self-determination be accorded the Palestinian people.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP> 
Let us see how it has been manifested. 
<P>(1) Although Resolution 181 called for the establishment of an Arab state in 
43.7% of Palestine, it never materialized. Instead, from May 1948 to June 1967, 
Israeli, Jordanian, and Egyptian forces occupied that area and Palestinian Arabs 
were never given the opportunity to create a state, but were precluded from so 
doing by force of arms. Similarly, under Jordanian rule, Palestinians of the 
West Bank were accorded no rights of democratic participation in their own 
governance. 
<P>(2) Throughout Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan 
Heights (since June 1967), Arab residents have been denied any right of 
self-determination and any democratic rights, save for municipal elections in 
1972 and 1976. Instead, they have been governed by patchwork of Turkish, 
British, Jordanian law, and Israeli Military Orders which includes a stringent 
set of Defence Regulations, introduced into Palestine by the British, which 
sanction deportations, house demolitions, land expropriation, and detention 
without charge. Israel has annexed East Jerusalem, taken direct control of over 
55% of land in the Bank and 40% of land in the Gaza Strip. Currently, there are 
some 140,000 Israeli Jews in East Jerusalem and its outer belt, and 
approximately 100,000 in the rest of the Occupied Territories, each of whom are 
governed by Israeli law, not the regulations governing Palestinians.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP> 
The Palestinian <I>Intifada</I> (uprising) is a direct response to these facts 
and to the Military Government's arbitrary taxation without representation, 
harassment and closure of Palestinian institutions, collective punishment, and 
systematic brutality. The very existence of these practices, and the on-going 
occupation itself, argue Palestinians, constitute a continual violation of their 
human rights and entitlement to self-determination. 
<P>(3) Several attempts to resolve the Palestinian problem in the international 
arena have failed to include Palestinian participation, most notably, the 
deliberations leading up to the framing of the important Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and of the so-called "Framework for Peace in the Middle 
East" contained in the celebrated Camp David Accords. The latter document, 
signed by Israel, Egypt, and the United States, goes some distance in providing 
Palestinians an opportunity to "participate in the determination of their own 
future," by entering into negotiations "on the resolution of the Palestinian 
problem in all its aspects." Palestinians charged, however, that the Accords 
violated their right to self-determination; they were excluded from the 
negotiations which led to the Framework, and no provision were made for their 
exercise of self-determination. The General Assembly concurred on the latter (GA 
Res. 34/65, Nov. 29, 1979). More explicitly, the Accords were an unusual means 
of securing peace between belligerents since they (a) failed to address the 
concerns of Palestinians outside the Occupied Territories (over 3 million of the 
roughly 5.2 million Palestinians); (b) excluded participation by the PLO -- the 
political organization supported by the overwhelming majority of Palestinians 
both inside and outside Palestine --in the projected negotiations over the 
status of the Territories; and (c) offered only a temporary "autonomy" to 
Palestinians with Israel retaining control of resources, public land, security, 
and foreign trade. Also, the Accords allow Israel to continue its controversial 
settlement program, an explicit violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
governing territories occupied as a result of war (see note 19) and of the 
preferences of the inhabitants of the territories (Mallison 1986, chp.6; Quigley 
1990, chp. 24). Perhaps this, more than anything, discredited the entire 
Framework in Palestinian eyes.<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP> 

<P>(4) In the celebrated peace negotiations which began in November 1991 in 
Madrid and have been carried on intermittently since that time, only 
Palestinians from the Occupied Territories (excluding Arab East Jerusalem) have 
been permitted representation. As with the Camp David Accords, the majority 
(roughly two-thirds) of all Palestinians and the PLO are excluded. For this 
reason, any proposals for peace issuing from these negotiations unacceptable to 
this larger community would not constitute an exercise of self-determination; 
their implementation would be yet another violation.<SUP><A

  we shall hear a good deal of that in the future, and, indeed, in it we may

<CENTER>&nbsp;Lord Curzon 1918 (Lloyd-George 1939, 739-740)</CENTER>
<P><BR><BR>
<P>The systematic violation of the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination in Palestine is at once a failure to observe and apply a 
recognized moral norm as well as a continuing source of the ongoing conflict 
between Israelis and Palestinians, Jews and Arabs. In this sense, Wilson's 
warning of the "peril" of ignoring the principle of self-determination was 
prophetic. Yet the principle remains relevant, for the struggle over Palestine 
continues to pose a severe threat to world peace. 
<P>To some degree, the majority in Palestine today does exercise 
self-determination, for Israel has been a sovereign state for over four decades, 
recognized by a large number of countries and a member of the United Nations. 
One might argue that Israel's legitimacy can <I>currently</I> be based upon the 
principle of regional-democratic self-determination; it would be sanctioned by a 
plebiscite held today among the six million plus persons currently residing in 
the territory of mandated Palestine, most of whom can reasonably claim to be 
legitimate residents. But deciding sovereignty by this simple procedure would be 
to ignore past and present violations of self-determination and to bypass the 
difficult question of exactly which parties are entitled to self-determination 
there now. In plain fact, Israel exists only because Palestinian Arabs have been 
systematically denied self-determination during the period 1917-1992 -- and 
Palestine is the <I>only</I> territory placed under a League of Nations Mandate 
in which the established inhabitants were not granted this privilege. Given 
Palestinians' persistent attachment to their ancient homeland, their unresolved 
grievances, and repeated international recognition of their entitlement to 
self-determination in Palestine (see note 18 and also Roberts 1990, 76-9), the 
status quo in Palestine cannot be sanctioned by appeal to regional-democratic 
self-determination. To do so would be a mockery of the principle. On the 
contrary, since the 5 million plus Palestinians constitute a politically 
coherent group with an acknowleged connection to the land, yet without having 
been the beneficiary of self-determination, they retain an entitlement. That 
force was used against them has not erased the fact that they are, and are 
recognized as being, a legitimate unit entitled to self-determination (Crawford 
1979, 117).<SUP><A 
href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~phildept/Kapitan/sdpal.html#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP> 

<P>But the clock cannot be turned back to 1947, nor to 1917, and it must be 
asked what the principle of regional-democratic self-determination 
<I>currently</I> requires in Palestine or Israel. Much depends on who now counts 
as a legitimate resident of that territory, and there is no clear criterion for 
settling this sticky normative question. It seems clear that entitlements, 
including legitimate residency, change with the passage of time; what was the 
case in 1947 or 1917 is not necessarily so in 1992. But how much do they change 
and over what periods of time? At present, large numbers of both Israeli Jews 
and Palestinian Arabs can legitimately claim entitlement to self-determination 
in Palestine or Israel. Yet, as time passes, this assessment is likely to change 
if the status quo is not altered. Current Zionist insistence that Jews as such 
need a safe haven and are entitled to self-determination in their ancient 
homeland can be matched by Palestinian claims for reestablishing themselves in 
their homeland, and for similar reasons. Their position is supported by even 
more comprehensive Arab and Islamic interests in sovereignty throughout the 
Fertile Cresent and Arabian Peninsula -- and was in this region that Sheriff 
Hussein of Mecca sought self-determination in 1915 -- if not throughout the Near 
East and North Africa combined. Indeed, population numbers, historical 
association, and the current economic, political, and military threats to the 
Middle Eastern peoples by aggressive Western powers lend force to arguments that 
the legitimate interests of Arabs require a measure of political and 
geographical unity throughout their traditional domain. Plainly, at this point 
in time, there is nothing in the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination itself -- as articulated above and as set forth in the 
relevant international documents -- which decisively settles the rival claims 
(Dinstein 1980, 255). 
<P>The normative discussion must not be stalemated by these observations, 
otherwise the door is opened to political chaos, violence, and the temporary 
rule by the strongest. A solution must be found and articulated, and if any is 
to be acceptable the principle of regional-democratic self-determination must be 
followed. Some have proposed creation of a single binational state under a 
democratic constitution throughout Palestine; others argue that the proper place 
for Palestinian self-determination is in Jordan. A more widely accepted 
compromise, one which would permit both Jews and Arabs a degree of 
self-determination in Palestine, is the two-state solution as originally 
envisioned in UN Resolution 181 (see the Jaffee Center Proposal 1989; Fuller 
1989). In this respect, the Palestine National Council's acceptance of UN 
Resolution 181 (November 1988), coupled by its appeal to self-determination, is 
significant. The majority of Palestinians, in supporting the Council's decision, 
have effectively conceded to Israeli Jews a right to self-determination in 
Israel, and in calling for their own state they are not only reasserting their 
right to self-determination in Palestine but delimiting the region within which 
it is to be exercised (officially, the 43.7% of Palestine alloted them by 
Resolution 181). 
<P>If compromise of this sort fails, radicals among the Palestinians, and 
perhaps within the Arab and Islamic world in general, will assume control of the 
other half of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict -- just as those who refuse 
territorial compromise have dominated the Israeli Government for much of the 
past 15 years. The prospects are sobering. Whitehead's admonition in 1937 
remains timely; one-sided bargains are to be avoided, the ideal visions of 
zealots must be curtailed. In conclusion, unless Palestinians, like Israeli 
Jews, are allowed some exercise of self-determination in choosing the type of 
political institutions they wish to be governed by <I>in</I> Palestine, whether 
as an independent democratic state or in affiliation with some other state 
(Jordan or Israel), then, for the forseeable future, there is utterly no chance 
for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. War and genocide would become 
the increasingly likely consequences -- a prospect which the world should find 
difficult to tolerate. <BR>&nbsp;

<P>1. This was also the conclusion of Great Britain's Palestine Royal Commission 
in 1937, which stated that the dispute between Jews and Arabs is "fundamentally 
a conflict of right with right." According to W. T. Stace, however, this is "a 
crude piece of ethical analysis," since Zionist claims to Palestine were based 
on unjust promises by the British, specifically, the Balfour Declaration 
discussed in Section 4 below (Khalidi 1971, 637-8). 
<P><A name=N_2_></A>2. 
<P>2. The question of the precise status of self-determination in international 
law, specifically, whether it is a legal right, has sparked considerable 
discussion (see Emerson 1971, who cites representatives from both sides of the 
controversy). Several argue that self-determination is recognized by 
international law as a right of certain collectives, e.g., Suzuki 1976, 828; 
Ofuatey-Kodjoe 1977, 160-7; Bassouni 1978, 2-4, and Mallison 1986, 193. Citing 
Chen 1976, Paust 1980, 8-9, observes that a case can be made for ranking 
self-determination as a human right, given Article 21 of the "Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights" (adopted by the UN General Assembly on Dec. 10, 
1948), and Friedlander 1980, 309,concludes that self-determination is a 
"principle" of international law. On the other hand, Emerson 1964 argues that 
there is no legal right of self-determination, Feinstein 1979, 462, denies that 
its inclusion in the UN Charter converts the principle into a "norm of 
international law," and Pomerance 1984, 337, denies that there is any "single 
right to self-determination in all cases." Crawford 1979, 84-118, while granting 
self-determination status within international law, vacillates between the 
language of 'principle' and 'right'. 
<P><A name=N_3_></A>3. Espiell 1980, 46-48, lists regions in which the exercize 
of self-determination has been granted, in many cases yielding national 
independence. See also Umozurike 1972, 193. 
<P><A name=N_4_></A>4. 4. On the other hand, Crawford 1979 states that it is 
"much less certain" that self-determination has <I>jus cogens</I> status, though 
allows that it may be protected by other means within International Law 
(Crawford 1979, 81, 365-7). 
<P><A name=N_5_></A>5. 5. Stace 1947, for example, discusses self-determination 
at this level: "the principles of law and justice do not change, or at least 
change very slowly. Now the main principle of international justice is that 
which was laid down in the Atlantic Charter. Nations should have the right of 
determining their internal affairs without aggression from outside nations. . . 
. It has always been, for that matter, the fundamental idea of democracy. For 
the self-determination or democracy of a nation means that its affairs are 
governed by the wishes of its own people." (in Khalidi 1971, 632). 
<P><A name=N_6_></A>6. 6. By combining the political mandate with the moral 
principle, Wilson took a step towards satisfying Kant's call for a merger of 
politics with morality: 
<P>"Men can no more escape the concept of right in their private relations than 
in their public ones; nor can they openly risk basing their politics on the 
handiwork of prudence alone, and, consequently, they cannot altogether refuse 
obedience to the concept of public right (which is particularly important in the 
case of international right)" (Kant 1983, 131, from the essay "To Perpetual 
Peace: A Philosophical Sketch" written in 1795). Compare Friedlander 1980, 
314-318, which discusses self-determination as a political principle. 
<P><A name=N_7_></A>7. 
<P>7. Umozurike 1972, 192, includes the mentioned constraints among the 
"characteristics" of self-determination, thereby adding something to the meaning 
of 'self-determination' beyond the idea of self-government or popular 
sovereignty. This is more idiosyncratic than standard. 
<P><A name=N_8_></A>8. 8. The case for the practical relevance for a code of 
international law is made forcefully in Kant 1983, especially in "Idea for a 
Universal History With a Cosmopolitan Intent" pp. 29-39 and "On the Proverb: 
That May Be True in Theory But Is No Practical Use" pp. 85-89. There are 
abundant examples illustrating Kant's point about the relevance of the concept 
of right in justifying public policy (see note 6). Even the leadership of so 
powerful a country as the United States has found it expedient to offer 
justification for its recent military actions in foreign arenas. Thus, the 
invasion of Panama in December 1989 was dubbed "Operation Just Cause," and, in 
his State of the Union Address of January 1991, President George Bush repeatedly 
emphasied the correctness of the armed action in removing Iraqi forces from 
Kuwait, stating the "our cause is just, our cause is moral, our cause is right." 

<P><A name=N_9_></A>9. 9. The American Secretary of State in 1919, Robert 
Lansing, reacted to President Wilson's call for self-determination in this way: 
"The more I think about the President's declaration as to the right of 
'self-determination,' the more convinced I am of the danger of putting such 
ideas into the minds of certain races. It is bound to be the basis of impossible 
demands on the Peace Congress and create trouble in many lands. What effect will 
it have on the Irish, the Indians, the Egyptians, and the nationalists among the 
Boers? . . . How can it be harmonized with Zionism, to which the President is 
practically committed? The phrase is simply loaded with dynamite. It will raise 
hopes which can never be realized. It will, I fear, cost thousands of lives. In 
the end it is bound to be discredited, to be called the dream of an idealist who 
failed to realize the danger until too late to check those who attempt to put 
the principle in force. What a calamity that the phrase was ever uttered! What 
misery it will cause!" (Lansing 1921, 97-8). This passage suggests that Lansing 
interpreted self-determination along national lines. 
<P><A name=N_10_></A>10. 10. Particularly important here is whether a given 
minority in a self-determining territory has strong cultural and political links 
to communities on the outside. This was an important factor in Nazi propaganda, 
and is relevant to understanding the conflict among Palestinians and Israelis, 
since both parties have strong links to external communities giving it the 
international dimension it has. 
<P><A name=N_11_></A>11. 11. Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant 
established the mandate system which called for tutelage by "advanced nations" 
over "peoples not yet able to stand by themselves" in the modern world ". . . 
until such time as they are able to stand alone" including certain communities 
formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire. It also specified that the "wishes of 
these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the 
Mandatory." 
<P><A name=N_12_></A>12. 12. Lloyd-George 1939, 721-773, relates some of the 
controversies concerning the borders of Palestine that occurred during the years 
1917-1921. 
<P><A name=N_13_></A>13. 13. British promises to Arabs were conveyed to their 
ally, Sheriff Hussein, the Emir of Mecca, by Sir Henry MacMahon, the British 
High Commissioner in Cairo at the time (see Khouri 1976, 405). Stone 1981, 
146-7, cites a letter of 1937 by MacMahon to the <I>Times</I> in which he 
claimed that Palestine "was not or was not intended to be included in the 
territories in which the independence of the Arabs was guaranteed in my pledge" 
and that this was understood by Sheriff Hussein. But this interpretation does 
not agree with the description of Hussein's views by David Lloyd-George who was 
Prime Minister at the time. Lloyd-George mentions that MacMahon himself was then 
(in 1915) "very reluctant" to discuss boundaries despite the insistence of 
Hussein to include all the area along the eastern Mediterranean coast up to 
Mersina, an area which includes Palestine even though it was not mentioned by 
name (Lloyd-George 1939, 660-2). 
<P><A name=N_14_></A>14. 14. This aspect of the Balfour Declaration is not 
accidental, as argued by J. M. N. Jeffries in "Analysis of the Balfour 
Declaration," reprinted in Khalidi 1971, 173-188. The role of the Zionist 
leadership in drafting the document is discussed in both Jeffries and F. Manuel, 
"Judge Brandeis and the Framing of the Balfour Declaration" in Khalidi 1971, 
165-172. 
<P><A name=N_15_></A>15. 15. The text of the King-Crane report is reprinted in 
Khalidi 1971, 213-218. Zionists are fond of citing a January 3, 1919 agreement 
between the Emir Feisal of Mecca, a leader of the Arab resistance in 1915-1918, 
and Chaim Weizmann. It called for large-scale Jewish immigration into Palestine 
provided that the rights of Arab farmers be protected and "no religious test 
shall ever be required for the exercize of civil or political rights" (Stone 
1981, 147-8). However, Feisal added that the agreement shall be void unless the 
Arabs achieve independence as promised by the British, and in a subsequent 
letter to Mr. Felix Frankfurter, an American Zionist, Feisal made it clear that 
Arabs would not accept a Jewish state as such but only a possible Jewish 
province in a larger Arab state (Khouri 1976, 12). There was no popular 
representation of nor support by Palestinian Arabs in the making of this 
agreement, as the results of the King-Crane Commission pointed out (see Hocking 
1945 reprinted in Khalidi 1971, 502). To the contrary, there was outright 
opposition (Muslih 1988, chp.5). 
<P><A name=N_16_></A>16. 16. A subcomittee of a General Assembly Ad Hoc 
committee to consider the UNSCOP proposals concluded that the proposed partition 
is contrary to Article 1 of the UN Charter (Khalidi 1971, 655). 
<P><A name=N_17_></A>17. 17. Had the principle of regional-democratic 
self-determination been observed in Palestine in 1918-48, the world would not be 
saddled with the current conflict among Israelis and Palestinians and its 
ominous potential for massive destruction. Of course, the state of Israel might 
never have come into being, but such would have been the consequences of strict 
adherence to the principle. 
<P><A name=N_18_></A>18. 18. See, for example, G.A. Resolutions 2535 B of Dec. 
10, 1969; 2649 of Nov. 30, 1970; 2672 C of Dec. 8, 1971; 2792 D of Dec. 6, 1971; 
3210 of Oct. 14, 1974; 3236 of Nov. 22, 1974 3376 of 1975. A more complete list 
of resolutions on the Palestinian/Israeli conflict is given in Mallison 1986, 
459-484. 
<P><A name=N_19_></A>19. 19. These figures are taken from "Report on Israeli 
Settlement in the Occupied Territories," published by the Foundation for Middle 
East Peace (Washington D. C., 1991). This report also cites a number of UN 
Security Council Resolutions which have condemned Israel's settlement program as 
contrary to Article 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention, and concurring 
discussions can be found in Mallison 1986, Quigley 1990, and Roberts 1990. 
Israelis have contested these judgments (for example, Stone 1981, 177-181), but 
they stand alone on this matter. Eugene Rostow cites Stone in a letter to <I>The 
American Journal of International Law 84</I> (1990), 717-20, in defending 
Israeli settlements. Robert's response (720-22) is gentle, but, for the most 
part, decisive. 
<P><A name=N_20_></A>20. 20. The issue of settlements has been a matter of 
utmost concern to Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. The Palestinian 
delegation currently (January 1992) engaged in peace negotiation with Israelis 
has repeatedly called for an immediate halt to construction of settlements (see, 
for example, the statement by the Palestinian representative, Dr. Haidar Abdel 
Shafi in <I>The New York Times</I>, Friday, November 1, 1991, p. A7). 
<P><A name=N_21_></A>21. 21. At the same time it is highly unlikely that 
Palestinians inside the Territories would break ranks with those outside of 
Palestine -- a fact that Israel has itself assured through its deportation 
policy, since many West Bank and Gaza Strip deportees now occupy important 
positions within the PLO. 
<P><A name=N_22_></A>22. 22. It is doubtful that the status quo can be justified 
by any other aspects of international justice or law, as Cattan 1976, Mallison 
1986, Quigley 1990, Roberts 1990 have argued. </P></BODY></HTML>
