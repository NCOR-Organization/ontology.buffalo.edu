<P>
<P>Just war theory deals with the justification of how and why wars are fought. 
The justification can be either theoretical or historical. The theoretical 
aspect is concerned with ethically justifying war and forms of warfare. The 
historical aspect, or the "just war tradition" deals with the historical body of 
rules or agreements applied (or at least existing) in various wars across the 
ages. For instance international agreements such as the Geneva and Hague 
conventions are historical rules aimed at limiting certain kinds of warfare. It 
is the role of ethics to examine these institutional agreements for their 
philosophical coherence as well as to inquire into whether aspects of the 
conventions ought to be changed. 
<P>Historically, the just war tradition--a set of mutually agreed rules of 
combat--commonly evolves between two similar enemies. When enemies differ 
greatly because of different religious beliefs, race, or language, war 
conventions have rarely been applied. It is only when the enemy is seen to be a 
people with whom one will do business in the following peace that tacit or 
explicit rules are formed for how wars should be fought and who they should 
involve. In part the motivation is seen to be mutually beneficial--it is 
preferable to remove any underhand tactics or weapons that may provoke an 
indefinite series of vengeance acts. Nonetheless, it has been the concern of the 
majority of just war theorists that such asymmetrical morality should be 
denounced, and that the rules of war should apply to all equally. That is just 
war theory should be universal. 
<P>The just war tradition is as old as warfare itself. Early records of 
collective fighting indicate that some moral considerations were used by 
warriors. They may have involved consideration of women and children or the 
treatment of prisoners. Commonly they invoked considerations of honour: some 
acts in war have always been deemed dishonourable, whilst others have been 
deemed honourable. Whilst the specifics of what is honourable differ with time 
and place, the very fact of one moral virtue has been sufficient to infuse 
warfare with moral concerns. 
<P>The just war theory also has a long history. Whilst parts of the Bible hint 
at ethical behavior in war and concepts of just cause, the most systematic 
exposition is given by Saint Thomas Aquinas. In the <I>Summa Theologicae</I> 
Aquinas presents the general outline of what becomes the just war theory. He 
discusses not only the justification of war, but also the kinds of activity that 
are permissible in war. Aquinas's thoughts become the model for later 
Scholastics and Jurists to expand. The most important of these are: Francisco de 
Vitoria (1548-1617), Francisco Suarez (1548-1617), Hugo Grotius (1583-1645), 
Samuel Pufendorf (1632-1704), Christian Wolff (1679-1754), and Emerich de Vattel 
(1714-1767). In the twentieth century it has undergone a revival mainly in 
response to the invention of nuclear weaponry and American involvement in the 
Vietnam war. The most important contemporary texts include Michael Walzer's 
<I>Just and Unjust Wars</I> (1977), Barrie Paskins and Michael Dockrill <I>The 
Ethics of War</I> (1979), Richard Norman <I>Ethics, Killing, and War</I> (1995), 
as well as seminal articles by Thomas Nagel "War and Massacre", Elizabeth 
Anscombe "War and Murder", and a host of others, commonly found in the journals 
<I>Ethics</I> or <I>The Journal of Philosophy and Public Affairs</I>. 
<P>Against the just war (<I>justum bellum</I>) are those of a skeptical 
persuasion who do not believe that morality can or should exist in war. There 
are various positions against the need or the possibility of morality in war. 
Generally, consequentialists and act utilitarians may claim that if victory is 
sought then all methods should be employed to ensure it is gained at a minimum 
of expense and time. Arguments from 'military necessity' are of this type: for 
example, to defeat Germany in World War II, it was deemed necessary to bomb 
civilian centers, or in the US Civil War, for General Sherman to burn Atlanta. 
However, intrinsicists may also decree that no morality can exist in the state 
of war, for they may claim it can only exist in a peaceful situation in which 
recourse exists to conflict resolving institutions. Or intrinsicists may claim 
that possessing a just cause (the argument from righteousness) is a sufficient 
condition for pursuing whatever means are necessary to gain a victory or to 
punish an enemy. A different skeptical argument, one advanced by Michael Walzer, 
is that the invention of nuclear weapons alter war so much that our notions of 
morality--and hence just war theories--become redundant. However, against 
Walzer, it can be reasonably argued that although such weapons change the nature 
of warfare they do not dissolve the need to consider their use within a moral 
framework. 
<P>Whilst sceptical positions may be derived from consequentialist and 
intrinsicist positions, they need not be. Consequentialists can argue that there 
are long term benefits to having a war convention. For example, by fighting 
cleanly, both sides can be sure that the war does not escalate, thus reducing 
the probability of creating an incessant war of counter-revenges. Intrinsicists 
can argue that certain spheres of life ought never to be targeted in war: for 
example, hospitals and densely populated suburbs. The inherent problem with both 
ethical models is that they become either vague or restrictive when it comes to 
war. Consequentialism is an open-ended model, highly vulnerable to pressing 
military needs to adhere to any code of conduct in war: if more will be gained 
from breaking the rules than will be lost, the consequentialist cannot but demur 
to military necessity. On the other hand, intrinsicism can be so restrictive 
that it permits no flexibility in war: whether it entails a Kantian thesis of 
respecting others or a classical rights position, intrinsicism produces an 
inflexible model that would restrain warrior's actions to the targeting of 
permissible targets only. In principle such a prescription is commendable, yet 
the nature of war is not so clean cut when military targets can be hidden 
amongst civilian centers. 
<P>Against these two ethical positions, just war theory offers a series of 
principles that aim to retain a plausible moral framework for war. From the just 
war (<I>justum bellum</I>) tradition, theorists distinguish between the rules 
that govern the justice of war (<I>jus ad bellum</I>) from those that govern 
just and fair conduct in war (<I>jus in bello</I>). The two are by no means 
mutually exclusive, but they offer a set of moral guidelines for waging war that 
are neither unrestricted nor too restrictive. The problem for ethics involves 
expounding the guidelines in particular wars or situations. <BR>

Ad Bellem</I> Convention</U></FONT></B>
<P>
<P>The principles of the justice of war are commonly held to be: having just 
cause, being declared by a proper authority, possessing right intention, having 
a reasonable chance of success, and the end being proportional to the means 
used. One can immediately detect that the principles are not wholly intrinsicist 
nor consequentialist--they invoke the concerns of both models. Whilst this 
provides just war theory with the advantage of flexibility, the lack of a strict 
ethical framework means that the principles themselves are open to broad 
interpretations. Examining each in turn draws attention to the relevant 
problems. 
<P>Possessing just cause is the first and arguably the most important condition 
of <I>jus ad bellum</I>. Most theorists hold that initiating acts of aggression 
is unjust and gives a group a just cause to defend itself. But unless 
'aggression' is defined, this proscription rather open-ended. For example, just 
cause resulting from an act of aggression can ostensibly be responses to a 
physical injury (e.g., a violation of territory), an insult (an aggression 
against national honor), a trade embargo (an aggression against economic 
activity), or even to a neighbor’s prosperity (a violation of social justice). 
The onus is then on the just war theorist to provide a consistent and sound 
account of what is meant by just cause. Whilst not going into the reasons of why 
the other explanations do not offer a useful condition of just cause, the 
consensus is that an initiation of physical force is wrong and may justly be 
resisted. Self-defense against physical aggression, therefore, is putatively the 
only sufficient reason for just cause. Nonetheless, the principle of 
self-defense can be extrapolated to anticipate probable acts of aggression, as 
well as in assisting others against an oppressive government or from another 
external threat (interventionism). Therefore, it is commonly held that 
aggressive war is only permissible if its purpose is to retaliate against a 
wrong already committed (e.g., to pursue and punish an aggressor), or to 
pre-empt an anticipated attack. 
<P>The notion of proper authority seems to be resolved for most of the 
theorists, who claim it obviously resides in the sovereign power of the state. 
But the concept of sovereignty raises a plethora of issues to consider here. If 
a government is just, i.e., it is accountable and does not rule arbitrarily, 
then giving the officers of the state the right to declare war is reasonable. 
However, the more removed from a proper and just form a government is, the more 
reasonable it is that its sovereignty disintegrates. A historical example can 
elucidate the problem: when Nazi Germany invaded France in 1940 it set up the 
Vichy puppet regime. What allegiance did the people of France under its rule owe 
to its precepts and rules? A Hobbesian rendition of almost absolute allegiance 
to the state entails that resistance is wrong; whereas a Lockean or 
instrumentalist conception of the state entails that a poorly accountable, 
inept, or corrupt regime possesses no sovereignty, and the right of declaring 
war (to defend themselves against the government or from a foreign power) is 
wholly justifiable. The notion of proper authority therefore requires thinking 
about what is meant by sovereignty, what is meant by the state, and what is the 
proper relationship between a people and its government. 
<P>The possession of right intention is ostensibly less problematic. The general 
thrust of the concept being that a nation waging a just war should be doing so 
for the cause of justice and not for reasons of self-interest or aggrandizement. 
Putatively, a just war cannot be considered to be just if reasons of national 
interest are paramount or overwhelm the pretext of fighting aggression. However, 
possessing right intention masks many philosophical problems. According to Kant, 
possessing good intent constitutes the only condition of moral activity, 
regardless of the consequences envisioned or caused, and regardless, or even in 
spite, of any self interest in the action the agent may have. The extreme 
intrinsicism of Kant can be criticized on various grounds, the most pertinent 
here being the value of self-interest itself. At what point does right intention 
separate itself from self-interest? On the one hand, if the only method to 
secure peace is to annex a belligerent neighbor’s territory, political 
aggrandizement is intimately connected with the proper intention of maintaining 
the peace. On the other hand, a nation may possess just cause to defend an 
oppressed group, and may rightly argue that the proper intention is to secure 
their freedom, yet such a war may justly be deemed too expensive or too 
difficult to wage; i.e., it is not ultimately in their self-interest to fight 
the just war. On that account, some may demand that national interest is 
paramount: only if waging war on behalf of freedom is also complemented by the 
securing of economic or other military interests should a nation commit its 
troops. The issue of intention raises the concern of practicalities as well as 
consequences, both of which should be considered before declaring war. 
<P>The next principle is that of reasonable success. This is another necessary 
condition for waging just war, but again is insufficient by itself. Given just 
cause and right intention, the just war theory asserts that there must be a 
reasonable probability of success. The principle of reasonable success is 
consequentialist in that the costs and benefits of a campaign must be 
calculated. However, the concept of weighing benefits poses moral as well as 
practical problems as evinced in the following questions. Should one not go to 
the aid of a people or declare war if there is no conceivable chance of success? 
Is it right to comply with aggression because the costs of not complying are too 
prohibitive? Is it not sometimes morally necessary to stand up to a bullying 
larger force, as the Finns did when Russia invaded in 1940, for the sake of 
national self-esteem? Besides, posturing for defense may sometimes make 
aggression itself too costly, even for a much stronger side. However, the thrust 
of the principle of reasonable success emphasizes that human life and economic 
resources should not be wasted in what would obviously be an uneven match. For a 
nation threatened by invasion, other forms of retaliation or defense may be 
available, such as civil disobedience, or even forming alliances with other 
small nations to equalize the odds. Historically, many nations have overcome the 
probability of defeat: the fight may seem hopeless, but a charismatic leader or 
rousing speech can sometimes be enough to stir a people into fighting with all 
their will. Winston Churchill offered the British nation some of the finest of 
war's rhetoric when it was threatened with defeat and invasion by Nazi Germany 
in 1940. For example: "Let us therefore brace ourselves to do our duty, and so 
bear ourselves that, if the British Commonwealth and its Empire lasts for a 
thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'" …And "What is 
our aim?…Victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror; victory, 
however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no 
survival." (Speeches to Parliament, 1940). 
<P>The final guide of <I>jus ad bellum</I>, is that the desired end should be 
proportional to the means used. This principle overlaps into the moral 
guidelines of how a war should be fought, namely the principles of <I>jus in 
bello</I>. With regards to just cause, a policy of war requires a goal, and that 
goal must be proportional to the other principles of just cause. Whilst this 
commonly entails the minimizing of war's destruction, it can also invoke general 
balance of power considerations. For example, if nation A invades a land 
belonging to the people of nation B, then B has just cause to take the land 
back. According to the principle of proportionality, B's counter-attack must not 
invoke a disproportionate response: it should aim to retrieve its land. That 
goal may be tempered with attaining assurances that no further invasion will 
take place. But for B to invade and annex regions of A is nominally a 
disproportionate response, unless (controversially) that is the only method for 
securing guarantees of no future reprisals. For B to invade and annex A and then 
to continue to invade neutral neighboring nations on the grounds that their 
territory would provide a useful defense against other threats is even more 
unsustainable. 
<P>On the whole the principles offered by <I>jus ad bellum</I> are useful 
guidelines. Philosophically however they invoke a plethora of problems by either 
their independent vagueness or by mutually inconsistent results. They are 
nonetheless a useful starting point for ethics and remain a pressing concern for 
statesmen and women. <BR>

<P>
<P>The rules of just conduct fall under the two broad principles of 
discrimination and proportionality. The principle of discrimination concerns who 
are legitimate targets in war, whilst the principle of proportionality concerns 
how much force is morally appropriate. One strong implication of being a 
separate topic of analysis for just war theorists, is that a nation fighting an 
unjust cause may still fight justly, or vice verse. A third principle can be 
added to the traditional two, namely the principle of responsibility, which 
demands an examination of where responsibility lies in war. 
<P>In waging war it is considered unfair and unjust to attack indiscriminately, 
since non-combatants or innocents are deemed to stand outside the field of war 
proper. Immunity from war can be reasoned from the fact that their existence and 
activity is not part of the essence of war, which is killing combatants. Since 
killing itself is highly problematic, the just war theorist has to proffer a 
reason why combatants become legitimate targets in the first place, and whether 
their status alters if they are fighting a just or unjust war. Firstly, a 
theorist may hold that being trained and/or armed constitutes a sufficient 
threat to combatants on the other side. Voluntarists may invoke the boxing ring 
analogy: punching another individual is not morally supportable in a civilized 
community, but those who voluntarily enter the boxing ring renounce their right 
not to be hit. Similarly, those who join an army renounce their rights not to be 
targeted in war; the rights of non-combatants (civilians, or 'innocents') remain 
intact and therefore they cannot be justly attacked. Others, avoiding a rights 
analysis, may argue that those who join the army (or who have even been pressed 
into conscription) come to terms with being a target, and hence their own 
deaths. This is argued for example by Barrie Paskins and Michael Dockrill in 
<I>The Ethics of War </I>(1979). However, since civilians can just as readily 
come to terms with their own deaths, their argument is not sufficient to defend 
the principle of discrimination. Rights based analyses are more productive, 
especially those that focus on the renouncing of rights by combatants by virtue 
of their war status, leaving a sphere of immunity for civilians. 
<P>Warfare sometimes unavoidably involves civilians. Whilst the principle of 
discrimination argues for their immunity from war, the practicalities of war 
provoke the need for a different model. The doctrine of double effect offers a 
justification for killing civilians in war, so long as their deaths are not 
intended but are accidental. Targeting a military establishment in the middle of 
a city is permissible according to the doctrine of double effect, for the target 
is legitimate. Civilian casualties are a foreseeable but accidental effect. 
Whilst the doctrine provides a useful justification of 'collateral damage' to 
civilians, it raises a number of issues concerning the justification of 
foreseeable breaches of immunity, as well as the balance to strike between 
military objectives and civilian casualties. 
<P>Another problem arises in defining who is a combatant and who is not. Usually 
combatants carry arms openly, but guerrillas disguise themselves as civilians. 
Michael Walzer, in his <I>Just and Unjust Wars</I> (1977) claims that the lack 
of identification does not give a government the right to kill 
indiscriminately--the onus is on the government to identify the combatants. 
Others have argued that the nature of modern warfare dissolves the possibility 
of discrimination. Civilians are just as necessary causal conditions for the war 
machine as are combatants, therefore, they claim, there is no moral distinction 
in targeting an armed combatant and a civilian involved in arming or feeding the 
combatant. The distinction is, however, not closed by the nature of modern 
economies, since a combatant still remains a very different entity from a 
non-combatant, if not for the simple reason that the former is presently armed 
(and hence has renounced rights or is prepared to die, or is a threat), whilst 
the civilian is not. On the other hand, it can be argued that being a civilian 
does not necessarily mean that one is not a threat and hence not a legitimate 
target. If Mr Smith is the only individual in the nation to possess the correct 
combination that will detonate a device, then he becomes not only causally 
efficacious in the firing of a weapon of war, but also morally responsible; 
reasonably he also becomes a legitimate military target. His job effectively 
militarizes his status. The underlying issues that ethical analysis must deal 
with involve the logical nature of an individual's complicity, or aiding and 
abetting the war machine, with greater weight being imposed on those logically 
closer than those logically further from the war machine in their work. At a 
deeper level, one can consider the role that civilians play in supporting an 
unjust war; to what extent are they morally culpable, and if they are culpable 
to some extent, does that mean they may become legitimate targets? This invokes 
the issue of collective versus individuality responsibility that is in itself a 
complex topic. 
<P>The second principle of just conduct is that any offence should remain 
strictly proportional to the objective desired. This principle overlaps with the 
proportionality principle of just cause, but it is distinct enough to consider 
it in its own light. Proportionality for <I>jus in bello</I> requires tempering 
the extent and violence of warfare to minimise destruction and casualties. It is 
broadly utilitarian in that it seeks to minimize overall suffering, but it can 
also be understood from other moral perspectives, for instance, from harboring 
good will to all (Kantian ethics), or acting virtuously (Aristotelian ethics). 
Whilst the consideration of discrimination focuses on who is a legitimate target 
of war, the principle of proportionality deals with what kind of force is 
morally permissible. In fighting a just war in which only military targets are 
attacked, it is still possible to breach morality by employing disproportionate 
force against an enemy. Whilst the earlier theoreticians, such as Thomas 
Aquinas, invoked the Christian concepts of charity and mercy, modern theorists 
may invoke either consequentialist or intrinsicist prescriptions, both are which 
remain problematic as the foregoing discussions have noted. However, it does not 
seem morally reasonable to completely gun down a barely armed belligerent tribe. 
At the battle of Omdurman in the Sudan, six machine gunners killed thousands of 
dervishes--the gunners may have been in the right to defend themselves, but the 
principle of proportionality demands that a battle ends before it becomes a 
massacre. Similarly, following the battle of Culloden, Cumberland ordered "No 
Quarter", which was not only a breach of the principle of discrimination, for 
his troops were permitted to kill the wounded as well as supporting civilians, 
but also a breach of the principle of proportionality, since the battle had been 
won, and the Jacobite cause effectively defeated on the battle field. 
<P>The principles of proportionality and discrimination aim to temper war's 
violence and range. They are complemented by other considerations that are not 
taken up in the traditional exposition of <I>jus in bello</I>, especially the 
issue of responsibility. <FONT size=2>
<P>&nbsp;</FONT><I>Jus in bello</I> requires that the agents of war be held 
responsible for their actions. This ties in their actions to morality generally. 
Some, such as Saint Augustine argues against this assertion: "who is but the 
sword in the hand of him who uses it, is not himself responsible for the death 
he deals." Those who act according to a divine command, or even God's laws as 
enacted by the state and who put wicked men to death "have by no means violated 
the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill.'" Whilst this issue is connected to the 
concepts of just cause, it does not follow that individuals waging a just, or 
unjust war, should be absolved of breaching the principles of just conduct. 
Readily it can be accepted that soldiers killing other soldiers is part of the 
nature of warfare, but when soldiers turn their weapons against non-combatants, 
or pursue their enemy beyond what is reasonable, then they are no longer 
committing legitimate acts of war but acts of murder. The principle of 
responsibility re-asserts the burden of abiding by rules in times of peace on 
those acting in war. The issues that arise from this principle include the 
morality of obeying orders (for example, when one knows those orders to be 
immoral), as well as the status of ignorance (not knowing of the effects of 
one's actions). 
<P>The foregoing has described the main tenets of the just war theory, as well 
as some of the problems that it entails. The theory bridges theoretical and 
applied ethics, since it demands an adherence, or at least a consideration of 
meta-ethical conditions and models, as well as prompting concern for the 
practicalities of war. A few of those practicalities have been mentioned here. 
Other areas of interest are: hostages, innocent threats, international 
blockades, sieges, the use of weapons of mass destruction or of anti-personnel 
weapons (e.g., land mines), and interventionism. <BR>
