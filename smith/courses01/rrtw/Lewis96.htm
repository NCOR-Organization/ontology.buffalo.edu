<H4>PROF. BERNARD LEWIS</H4>
<P>Jerusalem (19, Febraury, 1996)- An audience of over 400 turned out yesterday 
evening to hear Prof. Bernard Lewis, Professor Emeritus, Princeton University, 
New Jersey, USA, deliver the ninth B'nai B'rith World Center "Jerusalem Address" 
on "The Middle East Towards the Year 2000 - Patterns of Change".</P>
<P>In his introduction, Mr. Uri Lubrani, Government Coordinator for Lebanese 
Affairs, described Prof. Lewis as a world-respected authority on Islamic and 
Middle East history and a man whose counsel has been sought by many 
chancelleries, royal and other, inside and outside this region.</P>
<P>The "Jerusalem Address" was held in memory of Menache H. Eliachar. Hon. Moshe 
Landau, President Supreme Court (ret.) presented reflections on the late Menache 
H. Eliachar.</P>
<P>Prof. Shlomo Avineri, a noted political scientist at Hebrew University, 
winner of the Israel Prize for 1996 and "Jerusalem Address" keynote speaker in 
1989, presented a response to Prof. Lewis' address: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In a broad-ranging address, Prof. Lewis addressed some of the fundamental 
  issues facing the region: </P>
  <P>Opening with a historical perspective on the major changes which have 
  occurred in the Middle East, Prof. Lewis said that the current decade has seen 
  the end of an era which began in 1798 with the landing of Napoleon Bonaparte 
  in Egypt. The French occupation taught two sharp lessons to the peoples of 
  this area: the first, that a west European power, using a small expeditionary 
  force, could concur, occupy and rule one of the central provinces of the 
  Ottoman Empire. The departure of the French a few years later taught them the 
  second lesson: that only another European power - in this case the British - 
  could get them out. Thus began a period during which the ultimate power in the 
  Middle East resided elsewhere; when the basic theme of international relations 
  and of much else in this region was the rivalries of outside, imperial powers 
  contending for domination in the area. The most recent phase of this rivalry 
  was the Cold War between United States and the Soviet Union which dictated 
  their policy in the Middle East. In each case this rivalry went through 
  several, discernible, stages: interference, intervention, penetration, 
  domination and the final phase of reluctant departure. This phase has now 
  ended. The collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War, has brought the 
  region back, in a sense, to 1797: for the first time in slightly less than 200 
  years, the peoples of the region need to take responsibility for their own 
  affairs. For nearly two centuries decisions were made elsewhere, ultimate 
  power lay in distant lands and the principal task of statesmanship and 
  diplomacy was avoiding the dangers and exploiting the opportunities presented 
  by this situation. It is difficult to forsake the set old habits of a whole 
  era and to internalize their ramifications, Prof. Lewis said. With the end of 
  the era of great power domination the new Middle East has returned to a very 
  old Middle East in which regional powers have acquire an importance which they 
  did not have for two centuries.</P>
  <P>Prof. Lewis stated that of the two remaining great world powers, the U.S. 
  and Russia, neither will play an imperial role in this region: Russia because 
  it can't and the U.S. because it won't. With its ambitions, resources and 
  population, Russia cannot remain on the sidelines of great international 
  politics and it will return to the region. But it is unclear what kind of 
  Russia it will be: what kind of policy, aims and objectives it will pursue. 
  There are villaities eminating from Russia which indicate that it has some 
  desire to play a part in Middle East affairs but it manifestly lacks the 
  capacity to do so.</P>
  <P>Focusing on the role the United States in the region, Prof. Lewis said that 
  it withdraws from taking a dominant role in the region not due to lack of 
  ability but because of a lack of will. During the Cold War, U.S. presence in 
  the Middle East was part of its global strategy, designed to cope with a 
  global confrontation. With the end of the confrontation, the strategy becomes 
  unnecessary. The problem of American policy in this region is not American 
  involvement, but American reluctance to become involved, Prof. Lewis 
  maintained. </P>
  <P>Regarding the charge leveled against the United States mainly by Arab 
  states that its policies in the region are not evenhanded, Prof. Lewis offered 
  that while evenhandedness is a desirable quality in agencies of law 
  enforcement, it is irrelevant to the policies of a power pursing its interests 
  as defined by its leadership. If evenhandedness means treating all alike, it 
  is a manifestly suicidal policy for any government, American or other, to 
  pursue. </P>
  <P>Prof. Lewis described the advent of Israel - a separate power between the 
  Nile Valley and the Tigris-Euphrates Valley which did not exist before - as a 
  change with far reaching consequences for the region. </P>
  <P>The Middle East has reverted back to history in another important respect 
  in that it has been enlarged from its 1991 boundaries back to its 1798 
  boundaries. Whereas it became accustomed to think of the Middle East as a 
  vaguely defined areas with its northernmost limit at the Soviet frontier, this 
  is no longer the case. The various Middle East countries which were conquered 
  by the Russia in the last 18th and mid-19th century and incorporated into the 
  Russian empire are now reverting back to being part of the Middle East to 
  which they historically belong. These countries were artificially separated 
  from the Middle East by Russian conquest. Prof. Lewis described the remarkable 
  parallel between what is happening in the Transcaucasia and Moslem republics 
  to what happened in the former British and French dependencies in Southwest 
  Asia and Northern Africa. With the independence of the Moslem and 
  Transcaucasia republics from the former USSR. If these states can complete 
  their disentanglement from the Russian empire as did the Arab countries of the 
  Middle East from Britain and France, an important group of independent states 
  with ever-closer links to the 'older' Middle East will emerge. The burgeoning 
  relationship between five of these newly independent countries and Turkey 
  which speak languages closely related to Turkish indicates the emergence of a 
  'Turkic world' - in the same sense that there exists and 'Arab world' - 
  groping its way towards some sort of new unity, which Prof. Lewis described as 
  one of the most interesting phenomena in the region..</P>
  <P>Of the older states in the region, two stand out as being the most dynamic 
  and important: Turkey and Iran. Here too, the region is reverting back to the 
  realities of 1798 when there were only two main powers, Turkey and Persia, 
  battling over the centuries for dominance in the region. With the departure of 
  outside powers this rivalry has been renewed. Turkey and Iran present 
  competing models for the future which represent the two most likely 
  alternative futures for the whole region: Kamalist Turkey a model of secular 
  democracy and post-revolutionary Iran a model of Islamic theocracy. Both 
  though are manifestly under strain, as proven by the election showing of the 
  Islamic party in Turkey.</P>
  <P>Prof. Lewis noted that it is remarkable that in the entire region, not a 
  single ruler or regime commands any influence or prestige outside his 
  immediate area. Today rulers and regimes throughout the Arab world can command 
  obedience either through repression at home or terror abroad but do not 
  command the enormously wide support and popularity of a figure like Nasser. 
  The old fashion autocratic and new style totalitarian dictatorships do not 
  present an attractive model for the future, least of all for their own people. 
  </P>
  <P>Regarding the peace process, Prof. Lewis said that the advent of the peace 
  process is a consequence of the ending of the Cold War. So long as there was 
  an alternative patron whose support could be sought - French vs. British, 
  Allies vs. Axis, Soviet vs. Americans etc. - there was a way of avoiding the 
  prerogative of peace. Now there is no such game in town. The only alternative 
  today is Iran, but while the people in the region didn't know much about 
  Nazism or Communism and could therefore delude themselves into believing that 
  in a world dominated by the Nazis or the Communists they would have an honored 
  place, they have no such delusions about Iran or Islamic Fundamentalists which 
  they understand. In this situation Israel finds itself elevated to the status 
  of a lesser evil. </P>
  <P>Negotiations and, ultimately, peace became possible because one side found 
  itself in an extremely disadvantageous position. The Palestinian leadership 
  made a series of bad decisions: during the World War they chose the Axis, 
  during the Cold War they chose the Soviets, during the Gulf War they chose 
  Sadam Hussein. After a series of miscalculations of such staggering magnitude, 
  the Palestinian leadership understood that there would be a price to pay. For 
  the Palestinians, Oslo and all it entailed was a lifesaver. Prof. Lewis termed 
  'very fortunate' the fact that there was a government in Israel which 
  perceived this development as an opportunity for peace rather than an 
  opportunity for victory. It would have been easy to make the other choice - to 
  take advantage of the situation of utter powerlessness on the part of the 
  Palestinians. The government made a statesmanlike choice and this made what 
  followed possible. </P>
  <P>Relating to the impediments to peace, Prof. Lewis noted that there are 
  still powerful forces, factors and circumstances working against peace, 
  including the rejectionist camp which rejects anything short of total victory. 
  These camps are remarkably similar on both sides of the divide with both sides 
  claiming divine support for their policies. The rejectionists remain a 
  powerful force and have the capacity to delay the peace. </P>
  <P>Another problem is the ignorance of the other side's point of view. While 
  very few in Israel are aware of the sense of outrage that most Arabs feel over 
  the very existence of Israel in the region, Arabs have very little knowledge 
  about Jewish history or modern Zionism. Bookstores in the Arab carry, almost 
  exclusively, leftovers from the Third Reich, including the Protocols of the 
  Elders of Zion. These kinds of books are all the Arabic reader has to chose 
  from in order to learn about the connection between Jews and the Land of 
  Israel although a number of books about Israel have been translated of late. 
  </P>
  <P>The level of mutual fear and distrust is immense and therefore difficult to 
  overcome. The translation of these mutual fears creates very different 
  perspectives: Israel perceives itself as a small country surrounded by 
  countries with overwhelmingly large populations armed to the teeth waiting for 
  an opportunity to destroy it while Arabs perceive it as a powerful, 
  technologically advance, economically dominant country awaiting an opportunity 
  to extend it imperial rule over the whole Arab world. There is a real fear 
  that the old military menace which Israel posed is gone only to be replaced by 
  an economic menace. Over-enthusiasm by Israelis has encouraged, rather than 
  allayed these fears.</P>
  <P>Yet there are factors in favor of peace: a changed regional and global 
  situation which for the first time makes peace not only acceptable but even, 
  in certain respects, desirable in Arab countries. The second is the 
  realization by more rational elements on both sides that war in unwinable. A 
  series of wars proved that the Arabs cannot conquer Israel whereas the 
  Intifada proved to Israel that to continue indefinitely to rule over a 
  resentful alien population could succeed only at an unacceptable cost 
  involving the transformation of the very nature of society. Third, there is a 
  growing realization on both sides that the alternatives to compromise are 
  worse and entail unending war for both parties with no prospect of victory for 
  either and no visible way of ending it. This is the ultimate reason for any 
  optimism that one might have regarding the outcome of the peace process. </P>
  <P>Regarding Egypt, the pessimists have been proven wrong time and again: 
  peace outlived Saadat and strife, even war, between Israel and other Arab 
  states. The negative side of the peace with Egypt is its 'arctic coldness'. 
  The resentment towards peace with Israel stems from the fact that before 
  Saadat's peace overture towards Israel, Egypt was the accepted leader of the 
  Arab world. In every capital around the world, the Arab ambassadors formed a 
  group and the Egyptian ambassador was their leader. With the initiation of the 
  dialogue with Israel and signing of peace, followed by no other Arab country, 
  the Egyptians became the outcasts and pariahs of the Arab world, and it was 
  the Egyptian diplomatic corps which was the primary victim. When the new peace 
  process began in Madrid and Oslo there was a surge of hope that now, at last, 
  the rest of the Arab world had realized that Egypt was right and would its 
  lead: Egypt would resume its role of leadership and the road of peace would 
  lead through Cairo. This did not happen. The Palestinians, the Jordanians and 
  many others preferred to deal with Israel directly and not through Cairo, 
  leading the Egyptians to feel crowded out of their rightful role of leadership 
  in the Middle East as a whole.</P>
  <P>There are also differences in culture and way of life which divide Israelis 
  and Arabs, particularly noticeable where two peoples who had been hermetically 
  sealed from each other and whose only contact was hostile, were suddenly 
  brought into close proximity and direct links. Prof. Lewis noted in this 
  context the Casablanca conference: the overbearing Israeli presence was a 
  terrify experience which caused resentment and alarm in the Arab world. 
  Another example offered by Prof. Lewis is the difference in attitude toward 
  human rights and human dignity: the Israeli concern for human rights is not 
  greatly shared on the Arab side while the Arab concern for human dignity 
  doesn't appear to command much attention among Israelis. Prof. Lewis suggested 
  one might hope that each can learn from the other. </P>
  <P>Regarding Syria, Prof. Lewis stated that the Israeli demand for 
  normalization is either unreasonable or illogical. 'Normalization' is to 
  become normal, but asking for open frontiers, free movement of tourists is 
  asking not for normal treatment but rather for privileged treatment from 
  Syria. None of Syria's other neighbors enjoy this: she is surrounded by 
  countries which are suspicious and often openly hostile. For a country in this 
  situation to accept open frontiers even as they exist between Israel and 
  Jordan, seems totally unrealistic. Expressing admiration for Assad's 
  diplomatic skill, Prof. Lewis noted that though isolated, impoverished, 
  deprived of his super power patron, with his military growing antiquated and 
  his economy in a shambles, Assad has managed to parlay himself into a position 
  where he has interviews with two American presidents, 17 visits form an 
  American Secretary of State and is clearly setting the tone of the discussions 
  with the United States and Israe!. </P>
  <P>Narrowing his perspective further to the domestic situation in Israel, 
  Prof. Lewis said that the two options for the region are either democracy or 
  theocracy. At first glance there are many reasons why democracy should not 
  succeed in Israel, and few reasons why it should. Most Israelis come from 
  countries in which democracy is either nonexistent or gravely flawed. Another 
  factor is the neighborhood in which democracy generally does not flourish. The 
  circumstances of perpetual war or military alert inevitably gives a major role 
  to the military, a classical situation for a military take over. Yet there has 
  never been a military takeover in Israel and it seem unlikely in the highest 
  degree. Another impediment is the electoral system which must be one of the 
  worst in the free world, made worse by the latest reform. Democracy not only 
  survives but flourishes in Israel despite this. One obvious reason is that 
  Israel had been virtually quarantined in the region, and has therefore become 
  part of Western Europe, adopting its political mores. </P>
  <P>In a final note, Prof. Lewis said that Israel shares with its Arab 
  neighbors the problem of compatibility been religion and state. One of the 
  remarkable successes of Israel is the cohabitation between Jews who hail from 
  the countries of Christendom and Jews who came from Islamic countries. These 
  Christian and Muslim backgrounds are particularly important regarding the 
  relationship between religion and state. The lack of Jewish political culture 
  - natural since Jews had been cut off from the exercise of coercive power and 
  from sovereignty, with the memories of ancient Jewish sovereignty too remote 
  to provide much in the way of guidance - has left the field open to the 
  development of a political culture which is a derivative of existing political 
  systems rather an a unique creation. The Christian solution to the 
  compatibility between religion and state was to effect a separation between 
  the two. Moslems and Jews are still seeking their solution. </P>
  <P>Prof. Lewis ended by expressing the hope that they don't take too long in 
  finding it. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=RESPONSE>
<H4>Response: PROF. SHLOMO AVINERI</H4></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Prof. Avineri opened his response by focusing on an aside by Prof. Lewis 
  about which he did not elaborate: that Russia will return to the Middle East 
  in some capacity. Prof. Avineri stressed that will be Russia, not the Soviet 
  Union or Communism. The latter two formed the potent combination of a 
  territorial state and a revolutionary ideology which had a universal message. 
  This ideology was perceived by many in the East and in the developing world as 
  the wave of the future. Therefore the Soviet Union was not only a major power 
  with nuclear capability which threatened the West but a revolutionary, 
  universalistic, messianic movement which sometimes managed to 'bamboozle the 
  best and the brightest'. Today, though, regardless of the developments in 
  Russia, nobody in the jungles of Bolivia will view it again as a model for 
  emulation. Russia will no longer serve as a second homeland, as it did for 
  many revolutionaries in the 50's and 60's. So even if there is going to be 
  some sort of restoration of a Communist, nationalist, imperialist power in 
  Russia, while it will be a territorial power, a major power and perhaps even a 
  threatening power near to Israel, it will no longer pose this potent 
  combination of military might and a revolutionary redemptive ideology which 
  was the unusual combination of the Soviet Union: the Communist Manifesto in 
  the one hand and the Gulag in the other. This powerful combination is dead, 
  regardless of who is elected president in Russia.</P>
  <P>The logic behind the peace process between Israel and the Arabs will ensure 
  its continuation. One of the problems of living for fifty years in a condition 
  of war and lack of peace is that the word 'peace' in Israeli parlance has 
  taken on a messianic meaning. 'Peace' for Israelis never meant the kind of 
  relationship which existed between the United States and the Soviet Union - 
  they never went to war and therefore were always at peace - or the relation 
  between West and East Germany who never went to war; Israelis meant peace as 
  portrayed in Isaiah, chapter 2, verses 1-5 - a messianic peace. This explains 
  the emotional response to Egyptian President Saadat's visit to Jerusalem. 
  People really believed that peace, in its messianic sense, had broken out. 
  Therefore when Israelis observe the Israel-Egyptian peace and simply see 
  twenty years of armies no longer facing each other, they refer to it as a cold 
  peace, and feel disappointed, even cheated. Prof. Avineri suggested that there 
  are different kinds of peace: just as the U.S. is at peace with both Canada 
  and Mexico the nature of this peace is different in each case. The alternative 
  to making war is not making peace, but not making war and this is being 
  achieved between Israel and Egypt, between Israel and the Palestinians and, 
  with a greater degree of warmth, with Jordan. This has policy implications 
  because one of the prerequisites of a peace achieved after so many years of 
  enmity is that one has to tread very carefully and slowly. We do not do away 
  with enmity simply by signing a peace of paper, despite its political and 
  diplomatic importance. A treaty will not ensure an Isaiah peace. </P>
  <P>Prof. Avineri advised that Israel should not aim to attract a great 
  outpouring of love from the other side, but rather should aim to coexist 
  honorably and decently and minimize fears and friction. He suggested that 
  totally open borders not be the first step; not just for security reasons but 
  because both peoples have been traumatized by each other and need some time to 
  be with themselves and to feel secure in the knowledge that on the other side, 
  while there might not be great friends, at least there is no enemy. Full 
  integration, like in the EU or Benelux, is possible between more or less equal 
  economies. Therefore the only type of integration possible between Israel and 
  the Palestinian entity and perhaps other Arab countries is a vertical 
  integration. This does not mean that peace is not possible, but rather that a 
  certain peace is possible. Hopes should be realistic because if hopes are 
  raised too high there is a feeling of being let down and of the souring of a 
  promise if expctations are not met. </P>
  <P>Prof. Avineri drew attention to the fact that the Middle East contains more 
  than Arab countries - it includes countries with whom Israel does not have 50 
  years of enmity. Ben Gurion developed a strategy to develop relations with the 
  non-Arab elements in the region. He advised that even today, Israel should 
  place significant economic, political and intellectual focus on those 
  countries and develop with them the close kind of relationship which it seeks, 
  but perhaps cannot achieve, with Arab countries.</P>
  <P>In response to Prof. Lewis' remarks about democracy in Israel, Prof. 
  Avineri acceded to the point that most of Israel's citizens came from 
  non-democratic traditions however he disagreed with Lewis' on its 
  implications. Despite their countries of origin, most came with a political 
  culture which knew how to deal with questions of elections, representation, 
  voting, coalition building and of making compromises. This was the tradition 
  of the Jewish communities in the Diaspora. On the one hand the founding 
  fathers of Zionism revolted against the Diasporic tradition, against 
  rabbinical rules and against the disintegration of Jewish community life in 
  the 18th and 19th century. At the same time, they understood the democratic 
  process in community affairs. No church or Vatican dictated policy in the 
  Jewish community - the community elected the rabbis and the minority who 
  didn't like the decision broke away and formed their own synagogue. This is 
  exemplified by the plethora of Jewish organizations in the Diaspora today and 
  by the profusion of political parties in Israel - no political engineering can 
  do away with this multiplicity because they do represent real and different 
  interests. </P>
  <P>Prof. Avineri also found that while Bernard Lewis was correct is his 
  analysis that Jews in the Diaspora enjoyed but a derivative of sovereignty, 
  the authority of this derivative structure was really very Jewish. Typically, 
  Diaspora communities were a combination of solidarity, compromise and deep 
  division. This is a very Jewish concoction - at times very dangerous - but it 
  explains a lot about political life in Israel, Avineri said. </P>
  <P>Prof. Avineri concluded by saying that it is this tradition that has made 
  Israel's political system the kind of riddle which Bernard Lewis mentioned. 
  Whether they came from the East or the West, political representatives knew, 
  because of their tradition, how to form a political culture in which 
  compromise, coalition making and elections were a major element. This is very 
  much part of Israel's political achievement. The synagogue and shtetle served 
  as the Jewish town meetings and polls. Out of the revolt against these 
  traditions developed the political tradition in Israel today. As has happened 
  so often in history, the target of the revolt, in this case the Diaspora 
  Jewish culture, became ingrained in some ways into the results of the revolt 
  itself.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
