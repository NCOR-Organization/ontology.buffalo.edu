      width=23 align=left>n the course of the twentieth century it became 
      abundantly clear that things had gone badly wrong in the Middle East—and, 
      indeed, in all the lands of Islam. Compared with Christendom, its rival 
      for more than a millennium, the world of Islam had become poor, weak, and 
      ignorant. The primacy and therefore the dominance of the West was clear 
      for all to see, invading every aspect of the Muslim's public and even—more 
      painfully—his private life.<BR><BR>Muslim modernizers—by reform or 
      revolution—concentrated their efforts in three main areas: military, 
      economic, and political. The results achieved were, to say the least, 
      disappointing. The quest for victory by updated armies brought a series of 
      humiliating defeats. The quest for prosperity through development brought 
      in some countries impoverished and corrupt economies in recurring need of 
      external aid, in others an unhealthy dependence on a single resource—oil. 
      And even this was discovered, extracted, and put to use by Western 
      ingenuity and industry, and is doomed, sooner or later, to be exhausted, 
      or, more probably, superseded, as the international community grows weary 
      of a fuel that pollutes the land, the sea, and the air wherever it is used 
      or transported, and that puts the world economy at the mercy of a clique 
      of capricious autocrats. Worst of all are the political results: the long 
      quest for freedom has left a string of shabby tyrannies, ranging from 
      traditional autocracies to dictatorships that are modern only in their 
      apparatus of repression and indoctrination.<BR><BR>Many remedies were 
      tried—weapons and factories, schools and parliaments—but none achieved the 
      desired result. Here and there they brought some alleviation and, to 
      limited elements of the population, some benefit. But they failed to 
      remedy or even to halt the increasing imbalance between Islam and the 
      Western world.<BR><BR>There was worse to come. It was bad enough for 
      Muslims to feel poor and weak after centuries of being rich and strong, to 
      lose the position of leadership that they had come to regard as their 
      right, and to be reduced to the role of followers of the West. But the 
      twentieth century, particularly the second half, brought further 
      humiliation—the awareness that they were no longer even the first among 
      followers but were falling back in a lengthening line of eager and more 
      successful Westernizers, notably in East Asia. The rise of Japan had been 
      an encouragement but also a reproach. The later rise of other Asian 
      economic powers brought only reproach. The proud heirs of ancient 
      civilizations had gotten used to hiring Western firms to carry out tasks 
      of which their own contractors and technicians were apparently incapable. 
      Now Middle Eastern rulers and businessmen found themselves inviting 
      contractors and technicians from Korea—only recently emerged from Japanese 
      colonial rule—to perform these tasks. Following is bad enough; limping in 
      the rear is far worse. By all the standards that matter in the modern 
      world—economic development and job creation, literacy, educational and 
      scientific achievement, political freedom and respect for human 
      rights—what was once a mighty civilization has indeed fallen low. 
      <BR><BR>"Who did this to us?" is of course a common human response when 
      things are going badly, and many in the Middle East, past and present, 
      have asked this question. They have found several different answers. It is 
      usually easier and always more satisfying to blame others for one's 
      misfortunes. For a long time the Mongols were the favorite villains. The 
      <A class=magbodylink 
      href="http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/ihame/Sec11.htm" 
      target=outlink>Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century</A> were blamed 
      for the destruction of both Muslim power and Islamic civilization, and for 
      what was seen as the ensuing weakness and stagnation. But after a while 
      historians, Muslims and others, pointed to two flaws in this argument. The 
      first was that some of the greatest cultural achievements of Islam, 
      notably in Iran, came after, not before, the Mongol invasions. The second, 
      more difficult to accept but nevertheless undeniable, was that the Mongols 
      overthrew an empire that was already fatally weakened; indeed, it is hard 
      to see how the once mighty empire of the caliphs would otherwise have 
      succumbed to a horde of nomadic horsemen riding across the steppes from 
      East Asia.<BR><BR>The rise of nationalism—itself an import from 
      Europe—produced new perceptions. Arabs could lay the blame for their 
      troubles on the Turks, who had ruled them for many centuries. Turks could 
      lay the blame for the stagnation of their civilization on the dead weight 
      of the Arab past, in which the creative energies of the Turkish people 
      were caught and immobilized. Persians could lay the blame for the loss of 
      their ancient glories on Arabs, Turks, and Mongols impartially.<BR><BR>In 
      the nineteenth and twentieth centuries British and French paramountcy in 
      much of the Arab world produced a new and more plausible scapegoat—Western 
      imperialism. In the Middle East there have been good reasons for such 
      blame. Western political domination, economic penetration, and—longest, 
      deepest, and most insidious of all—cultural influence changed the face of 
      the region and transformed the lives of its people, turning them in new 
      directions, arousing new hopes and fears, creating new dangers and new 
      expectations without precedent in their cultural past. <BR><BR>But the 
      Anglo-French interlude was comparatively brief, and ended half a century 
      ago; Islam's change for the worse began long before and continued unabated 
      afterward. Inevitably, the role of the British and the French as villains 
      was taken over by the United States, along with other aspects of Western 
      leadership. The attempt to transfer the guilt to America has won 
      considerable support but, for similar reasons, remains unconvincing. 
      Anglo-French rule and American influence, like the Mongol invasions, were 
      a consequence, not a cause, of the inner weakness of Middle Eastern states 
      and societies. Some observers, both inside and outside the region, have 
      pointed to differences in the post-colonial development of former British 
      possessions—for example, between Aden, in the Middle East, and Singapore 
      or Hong Kong; or between the various lands that once made up the British 
      Empire in India.<BR><BR>Another European contribution to this debate is 
      anti-Semitism, and blaming "the Jews" for all that goes wrong. Jews in 
      traditional Islamic societies experienced the normal constraints and 
      occasional hazards of minority status. Until the rise and spread of 
      Western tolerance in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, they were 
      better off under Muslim than under Christian rule in most significant 
      respects. With rare exceptions, where hostile stereotypes of the Jew 
      existed in the Islamic tradition, Islamic societies tended to be 
      contemptuous and dismissive rather than suspicious and obsessive. This 
      made the events of 1948—the failure to prevent the <A class=magbodylink 
      href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00hb0" 
      target=outlink>establishment of the state of Israel</A>—all the more of a 
      shock. As some writers observed at the time, it was humiliating enough to 
      be defeated by the great imperial powers of the West; to suffer the same 
      fate at the hands of a contemptible gang of Jews was intolerable. 
      Anti-Semitism and its image of the Jew as a scheming, evil monster 
      provided a soothing antidote.<BR><BR>The earliest specifically 
      anti-Semitic statements in the Middle East occurred among Christian 
      minorities, and can usually be traced back to European originals. They had 
      limited impact; during the Dreyfus trial in France, for example, when a 
      Jewish officer was unjustly accused and condemned by a hostile court, 
      Muslim comments usually favored the persecuted Jew against his Christian 
      persecutors. But the poison continued to spread, and starting in 1933, 
      Nazi Germany and its various agencies made a concerted and on the whole 
      remarkably successful effort to promote European-style anti-Semitism in 
      the Arab world. The struggle for Palestine greatly facilitated the 
      acceptance of the anti-Semitic interpretation of history, and led some to 
      attribute all evil in the Middle East—and, indeed, in the world—to secret 
      Jewish plots. This interpretation has pervaded much of the public 
      discourse in the region, including that seen in education, the media, and 
      even entertainment.<BR><BR>An argument sometimes adduced is that the cause 
      of the changed relationship between East and West is not a Middle Eastern 
      decline but a Western upsurge—the discoveries and the scientific, 
      technological, industrial, and political revolutions that transformed the 
      West and vastly increased its wealth and power. But this is merely to 
      restate the question: Why did the discoverers of America sail from Spain 
      rather than from a Muslim Atlantic port, out of which such voyages were 
      indeed attempted in earlier times? Why did the great scientific 
      breakthrough occur in Europe and not, as one might reasonably have 
      expected, in the richer, more advanced, and in most respects more 
      enlightened realm of Islam?<BR><BR><IMG height=58 alt=A hspace=0

      width=41 align=left> more sophisticated form of the blame game finds its 
      targets inside, rather than outside, Islamic society. One such target is 
      religion—for some, specifically Islam. But to blame Islam as such is 
      usually hazardous and not often attempted. Nor is it very plausible. For 
      most of the Middle Ages it was neither the older cultures of the Orient 
      nor the newer cultures of the West that were the major centers of 
      civilization and progress but the world of Islam. There old sciences were 
      recovered and developed and new sciences were created; there new 
      industries were born and manufactures and commerce were expanded to a 
      level without precedent. There, too, governments and societies achieved a 
      freedom of thought and expression that led persecuted Jews and even 
      dissident Christians to flee Christendom for refuge in Islam. In 
      comparison with modern ideals, and even with modern practice in the more 
      advanced democracies, the medieval Islamic world offered only limited 
      freedom, but that was vastly more than was offered by any of its 
      predecessors, its contemporaries, or most of its successors.<BR><BR>The 
      point has often been made: If Islam is an obstacle to freedom, to science, 
      to economic development, how is it that Muslim society in the past was a 
      pioneer in all three—and this when Muslims were much closer in time to the 
      sources and inspiration of their faith than they are now? Some have posed 
      the question in a different form—not "What has Islam done to the Muslims?" 
      but "What have the Muslims done to Islam?"—and have answered by laying the 
      blame on specific teachers and doctrines and groups.<BR><BR>For those 
      known nowadays as Islamists or fundamentalists, the failures and 
      shortcomings of modern Islamic lands afflict those lands because they 
      adopted alien notions and practices. They fell away from authentic Islam 
      and thus lost their former greatness. Those known as modernists or 
      reformers take the opposite view, seeing the cause of this loss not in the 
      abandonment but in the retention of old ways, and especially in the 
      inflexibility and ubiquity of the Islamic clergy, who, they say, are 
      responsible for the persistence of beliefs and practices that might have 
      been creative and progressive a thousand years ago but are neither today. 
      The modernists' usual tactic is not to denounce religion as such, still 
      less Islam in particular, but to level their criticism against fanaticism. 
      It is to fanaticism—and more particularly to fanatical religious 
      authorities—that they attribute the stifling of the once great Islamic 
      scientific movement and, more generally, of the freedom of thought and 
      expression.<BR><BR>A more common approach to this theme has been to 
      discuss a specific problem: the place of religion and of its professional 
      exponents in the political order. In this view a principal cause of 
      Western progress is the separation of Church and State and the creation of 
      a civil society governed by secular laws. Another approach has been to 
      view the main culprit as the relegation of women to an inferior position 
      in Muslim society, which deprives the Islamic world of the talents and 
      energies of half its people and entrusts the other half's crucial early 
      years of upbringing to illiterate and downtrodden mothers. The products of 
      such an education, it has been said, are likely to grow up either arrogant 
      or submissive, and unfit for a free, open society. However one evaluates 
      the views of secularists and feminists, their success or failure will be a 
      major factor in shaping the Middle Eastern future.<BR><BR>Some solutions 
      that once commanded passionate support have been discarded. The two 
      dominant movements in the twentieth century were socialism and 
      nationalism. Both have been discredited—the first by its failure, the 
      second by its success and consequent exposure as ineffective. Freedom, 
      interpreted to mean national independence, was seen as the great talisman 
      that would bring all other benefits. The overwhelming majority of Muslims 
      now live in independent states, but this has brought no solutions to their 
      problems. National socialism, the bastard offspring of both ideologies, 
      persists in a few states that have preserved the Nazi-Fascist style of 
      dictatorial government and indoctrination through a vast security 
      apparatus and a single all-powerful party. These regimes have failed every 
      test except survival, and have brought none of the promised benefits. If 
      anything, their infrastructures are even more antiquated than those of 
      other Muslim states, their armed forces designed primarily for terror and 
      repression.<BR><BR>At present two answers to the question of what went 
      wrong command widespread support in the Middle East, each with its own 
      diagnosis and corresponding prescription. One attributes all evil to the 
      abandonment of the divine heritage of Islam and advocates return to a real 
      or imagined past. That is the way of the Iranian revolution and of the 
      so-called fundamentalist movements and regimes in various Muslim 
      countries. The other condemns the past and advocates secular democracy, 
      best embodied in the Turkish Republic, proclaimed in 1923 by Kemal 
      Atat&uuml;rk.<BR><BR>For the oppressive but ineffectual governments that rule 
      much of the Middle East, finding targets to blame serves a useful, indeed 
      an essential, purpose—to explain the poverty that they have failed to 
      alleviate and to justify the tyranny that they have introduced. They seek 
      to deflect the mounting anger of their unhappy subjects toward other, 
      outside targets.<BR><BR>But growing numbers of Middle Easterners are 
      adopting a more self-critical approach. The question "Who did this to us?" 
      has led only to neurotic fantasies and conspiracy theories. And the 
      question "What did we do wrong?" has led naturally to a second question: 
      "How do we put it right?" In that question, and in the various answers 
      that are being found, lie the best hopes for the future. <BR><BR>During 
      the past few weeks the worldwide exposure given to the views and actions 
      of Osama bin Laden and his hosts the Taliban has provided a new and vivid 
      insight into the eclipse of what was once the greatest, most advanced, and 
      most open civilization in human history.<BR><BR>To a Western observer, 
      schooled in the theory and practice of Western freedom, it is precisely 
      the lack of freedom—freedom of the mind from constraint and 
      indoctrination, to question and inquire and speak; freedom of the economy 
      from corrupt and pervasive mismanagement; freedom of women from male 
      oppression; freedom of citizens from tyranny—that underlies so many of the 
      troubles of the Muslim world. But the road to democracy, as the Western 
      experience amply demonstrates, is long and hard, full of pitfalls and 
      obstacles.<BR><BR>If the peoples of the Middle East continue on their 
      present path, the suicide bomber may become a metaphor for the whole 
      region, and there will be no escape from a downward spiral of hate and 
      spite, rage and self-pity, poverty and oppression, culminating sooner or 
      later in yet another alien domination—perhaps from a new Europe reverting 
      to old ways, perhaps from a resurgent Russia, perhaps from some expanding 
      superpower in the East. But if they can abandon grievance and victimhood, 
      settle their differences, and join their talents, energies, and resources 
      in a common creative endeavor, they can once again make the Middle East, 
      in modern times as it was in antiquity and in the Middle Ages, a major 
      center of civilization. For the time being, the choice is theirs.<BR><BR><!--ARTICLE CONTENT ENDS--><!--endclickprintinclude--><!--POST & RIPOSTE-->
