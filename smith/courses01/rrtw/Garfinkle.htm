      <H3>FPRI Wire<BR>September 11: Before and After</H3>
      <P>Volume 9, Number 8<BR>October 2001 </P>
      <P>by Adam Garfinkle </P>
      <P><EM>Adam Garfinkle, editor of The National Interest, served on the 
      staff of the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century and is a 
      former FPRI Senior Fellow. His writings appear in this space from time to 
      time.</EM> </P>
      <P>Before we can see clearly the way ahead from the horrible events of 
      September 11, we need to look backward to sources -- for if we do not 
      understand how these events came about, we will be hard pressed to prevent 
      recurrences. Indeed, there are many sources for the events of September 
      11, some remote and some more proximate, some across the sea and some here 
      at home. The purpose for naming them is not to engage in recrimination; 
      there will be time for that later. The purpose is prophylaxis aimed at the 
      future. </P>
      <P>Starting at home, it is clear that in some respects the events of 
      September 11 are the bitter wage of several policy failures. Osama bin 
      Laden and those of his ideological ilk are furious at the United States 
      for desecrating the land of the two mosques -- Saudi Arabia -- by its 
      military presence. Clearly, that presence would not be necessary in its 
      present extent were it not for the Ba'athi regime next door in Iraq. That 
      Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath are still there is not, in my view, the 
      result of the error made in February and March of 1991 - namely, the 
      failure to march to Baghdad at the end of the Gulf War -- but that the 
      United States under the two Clinton Administrations was both feckless and 
      unimaginative when it came to understanding and acting against Ba'athi 
      Iraq. Every Middle East expert worth his or her salt said at the time that 
      a prolonged U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be a 
      constant and deepening social abrasion within those countries that would 
      eventually come to haunt the United States. They were right. Had the 
      Ba'ath problem been ended earlier, too, the sanctions regime against Iraq 
      would have ended with it, and with both the pretext -- for that is all it 
      is -- for those who accuse the United States of state terrorism by 
      "killing over a million" Iraqi civilians. </P>
      <P>Of course, if one goes a step farther back in the chain of causality, 
      it is undeniable that the greatest failure of imagination in U.S. policy 
      concerns energy. The United States would not have gone to war to free 
      Kuwait, it was said at the time, if Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
      exported artichokes instead of oil. However morally uncomfortable it may 
      be to admit the truth of this, true it most certainly is. That the United 
      States, Western Europe, and the economically vibrant parts of the Far East 
      are all dependent on imported oil is a collective failure of science 
      policy in the first degree. Had it not been for that failure, the nature 
      of the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia would be dramatically different 
      today -- in the direction of far less significant. </P><BR>
      <H4>THE SAUDI ROLE </H4>
      <P>Speaking of Saudi Arabia, it is clear that the nature of Saudi society 
      and the Saud regime are the key seedbeds for the terrorism of September 
      11. Saudi Islam is Wahhabi Islam, and Wahhabism is not traditional Islam. 
      Wahhabism is, in essence, an 18th century Arabian revitalization movement, 
      since attenuated but hardly neutered, that was designed to purge Islam 
      from the accretions of the previous half dozen or so centuries and return 
      it to an imagined pure, original form. Wahhabism is more aggressively 
      evangelical, more ascetic, more scripturally literalist, more xenophobic, 
      more intolerant, and more militant than other forms of Islam. In the name 
      of Wahhabism, Saudi citizens and the Saudi government have spent roughly 
      $10 billion a year, year after year, proselytizing the faith all over the 
      world. It would be wrong to say that all of this money supports terrorism, 
      but it does inculcate attitudes and sustain institutions that, in 
      combination with other factors, do promote terrorism. It is no coincidence 
      that no other worship services other than Islamic ones are permitted in 
      the Kingdom. It is no coincidence, either, that the government oppresses 
      its Shi'a minority, mainly in al-Hasa province. And it is no coincidence 
      that the high fervor of Wahhabism, now spreading rapidly among younger 
      Saudi clergy, has become so much a threat to the ruling Saud family that 
      the Saudis are involved in a very dirty deal: they allow wealthy Saudis to 
      fund extremists, including Osama bin Laden, in return for a pledge that 
      acts of extremism will not be undertaken on Saudi soil or against Saudi 
      interests abroad. For years the regime, the government-controlled press, 
      and the pliant and comfortable intellectuals in the Kingdom, such as they 
      are, have been directing the growing resentment, fanaticism, and violence 
      of that society away from themselves, toward Israel and the United States. 
      </P>
      <P>American experts on Saudi Arabia, radical Islam, and the Middle East -- 
      including those in the U.S. government -- have known about all this for 
      years. Successive U.S. administrations have done nothing; they have been 
      too afraid to raise such a sensitive issue with the Saudi government, lest 
      U.S. economic interests in the Kingdom suffer. This cowardice has got to 
      stop. </P>
      <P>Saudi Wahhabi evangelism has succeeded wonderfully in two places in 
      particular: in Pakistan, particularly its ethnic Pashtun areas, and from 
      there to Afghanistan, in the form of the Taliban. That success explains 
      why Saudi Arabia was one of only three governments to maintain diplomatic 
      relations with the Taliban (recently broken under U.S. pressure). The 
      Taliban could not have formed and come to power without Pakistan's aid, 
      particularly the aid of Pakistan's Inter- Service Intelligence (ISI) 
      service, which is suffused with Wahhabist true believers. With bin Laden 
      and some 7,000 Arab mercenaries in Afghanistan, Pakistan's ISI was able to 
      train its own terrorists to operate against India in Kashmir. Over time, 
      bin Laden's Arab legion has become the shock troops of the Taliban in its 
      war against the remaining Afghani opposition. Bin Laden himself has also 
      become an important financial supporter of the Taliban, from money 
      received from wealthy Saudis and others (bin Laden's family inheritance 
      has long been exhausted), and also an ideological influence within the 
      Taliban, in recent years pushing it to ever farther extremism. It is bin 
      Laden's influence, for example, that led to the destruction of the 
      Buddhist shrines in Bamiyan, and that also has caused a widening split 
      within the Taliban leadership and among its veteran mujahideen 
      rank-and-file. </P>
      <P>In light of all this, consider the wisdom of the United States seeming 
      to target bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network first and foremost, which are 
      emanations of this Saudi- Pakistani-Taliban connection, while claiming at 
      the same time that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are our allies. Perhaps these 
      alliances are tactical necessities only for the first part of the war 
      against terrorism. Perhaps the war represents a chance for moderate 
      elements in Pakistan to wage a determined civil struggle against the 
      Talibanization of their country. Perhaps, too, the Al-Saud will see the 
      error of its ways and change its modus operandi with regard to its 
      internal opposition. But this much is clear: without the replacement of 
      the Taliban regime with one more responsible and responsive to the needs 
      of the people of Afghanistan, without the elimination of the seething 
      Wahhabi madrassas in and around Peshawar and Quetta in Pakistan, and 
      without a sea-change in Saudi internal practices, it will be impossible to 
      "drain the swamp" and really put an end to the kind of terrorism we 
      suffered last month. </P>
      <P>There are other sources of the disaster, too. The failure of the 
      Clinton Administration to understand that globalization generates 
      resentment as well as economic growth was breathtaking. The triumphalism 
      of its rhetoric -- particularly the foolish repetition of the 
      "indispensable nation" mantra -- its arrogant double standards, and its 
      self-absorbed use of force in the Balkans had the effect of adding 
      gratuitous resentment to that which one must expect to be directed toward 
      a socially anti-status quo liberal power. This did not cause bin Laden to 
      do what he did, but it has made it much more popular worldwide -- even in 
      Greece, where soccer teams have taken to burning the American flag in 
      public to the wild applause of their fans. </P>
      <P>Then there are the intelligence failures and episodes of rank 
      bureaucratic incompetence, not just in the CIA but also in the FBI, the 
      INS, and the FAA. This cannot be blamed on the Clinton Administration 
      alone; these problems predate 1993, and Congress is complicit in nearly 
      all of them. Even the current administration deserves some criticism: when 
      in mid-February the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century 
      (a.k.a. the Hart-Rudman Commission) warned in dramatic and graphic terms 
      that mass-casualty terrorism was coming and that we were not ready for it, 
      the administration shelved the report. When a few Congressmen and a 
      Senator or two tried to promote the Commission's homeland security 
      recommendations, the administration fobbed off the effort by creating a 
      study committee under the auspices of Vice President Dick Cheney. It was 
      supposed to report on October 1. If the administration had taken the 
      Commission's concerns and recommendations seriously from the beginning, it 
      is unlikely that the attacks of September 11 could have been prevented -- 
      but not impossible. </P><BR>
      <H4>THE ISRAEL FACTOR </H4>
      <P>A word about what is not a source of the September 11 attacks is also 
      in order, given the ugly rise of Israel- bashing we are beginning to see. 
      </P>
      <P>Osama bin Laden hates the United States mainly for what it is, not for 
      what it does. As he sees it, what it does is a natural consequence of what 
      it is: decadent, immoral, materialistic, and sexually perverse. This is 
      just as true as the fact that Khalid Islambouli did not murder Anwar al- 
      Sadat because he signed a peace treaty with Israel, but because he was, in 
      Islambouli's eyes, "Pharaoh," an apostate of the worst kind. Apostates 
      naturally do such things. Bin Laden cares deeply about the desecration of 
      Saudi Arabia. He cares next about the desecration of Iraq, which, as 
      Bernard Lewis pointed out long ago, are the two most sacred pieces of 
      geography to a Wahhabi Muslim. Amazing as it sounds to us, the U.S. 
      humanitarian mission to Somalia in 1993 was interpreted in bin Laden's 
      addled, insular brain, as an attempt to flank the Hejaz as a prelude to a 
      "Crusader" attack upon it. Last and least in his view comes Palestine and 
      Jerusalem. Bin Laden's fatwas are pronounced against Crusaders and Jews, 
      in that order. Insofar as he hates Jews, he hates American Jews as much as 
      he hates Israeli Jews for, in the common versions of Islamist 
      conspiratorial cant, bin Laden believes that Zionists control America. The 
      World Trade Center was not chosen as a target just because it was a 
      general symbol of American wealth. Bin Laden's logic, while delusional, is 
      straightforward: if the Zionists control America and the vehicle of 
      control is international finance, and if the World Trade Center is the 
      heart of international finance, then the building must be full of Jews. 
      What an excellent place, then, to kill a great many prominent "Zionists." 
      </P>
      <P>Israeli-Palestinian problems have not been upper-most on bin Laden's 
      list, which explains why he perpetrated acts of war against the United 
      States when the Oslo peace process appeared to be thriving. There is 
      simply no correlation between Al-Qaeda's activities and the tenor of 
      Israeli- Palestinian relations. But the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is 
      not as low on the list as one moves across the Arab world from east to 
      west. As in Saudi Arabia, the anti-Israeli and outright anti-Semitic 
      sentiment in the Levant and Egypt and much of North Africa is derivative 
      of a controlled press, and of weak regimes deflecting hostility against 
      themselves onto Israel and America. The version of modern history that 
      much of the Arab "street" believes after decades of government 
      press-spawned disinformation is truly bizarre. It explains why 
      Palestinians in Nablus danced to celebrate the terrorist strike of 
      September 11, and why it has been hailed in the Egyptian and Syrian press. 
      It is easy to be angry at these revelers and hack journalists, but one 
      should resist the urge. Put in their place, one would see that the great 
      majority simply do not know any better. It is more appropriate, as Fouad 
      Ajami has explained so brilliantly, to be angry at the regimes, and at the 
      particularly Arab traison d'clercs that has made it all possible. </P>
      <P>What this means, in essence, is that, yes, U.S. support for Israel is a 
      source of anti-Americanism in the Arab and Muslim worlds -- indeed, as far 
      east as Indonesia -- particularly so during a time of increased Israeli- 
      Palestinian violence. It plays at least indirectly into the popularity of 
      Osama bin Laden in Saudi Arabia and outside of it. It does create 
      diplomatic complications for the United States in trying to build a level 
      of cooperation with Arab and Muslim governments that does not, in turn, 
      threaten to undo those governments from within. But for bin Laden and the 
      Taliban and the Wahhabist ulema in Peshawar, it is a marginal issue. </P>
      <P>That being the case, the current U.S. administration's rush to curry 
      favor with Arabs and Muslims by sacrificing Israeli interests has been 
      most unfortunate. Before September 11, Bush Administration principals, 
      even the Secretary of State, insisted that the Palestinian violence had to 
      stop before the next stages of the Mitchell Plan could proceed. After 
      September 11, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon came under intense 
      pressure to stage a diplomatic pantomime with Yasir Arafat in order to 
      facilitate U.S. coalition-building efforts. (It has to be a pantomime; who 
      in his right mind could believe, after Arafat's behavior since Camp David 
      and his speech in Durban, that a genuine peace settlement is possible as 
      long as he stands at the leadership of the Palestinians?) Sharon was 
      reduced to begging first for just 48 hours without shooting, then 24 
      hours, and then for a meeting even under fire -- which occurred when 
      Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met in late September. 
      Then, almost immediately after terrorist incidents in Israel on October 3 
      and 4 in which five Israeli civilians were murdered, President Bush stated 
      his approval in principle for Palestinians statehood as rumors rose of a 
      major U.S. initiative in the making that would, as one U.S. official put 
      it, "have a lot in it that would please the Palestinian side." About ten 
      days earlier, the United States, in trying to freeze the assets of 
      terrorist groups, deliberately left Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hizballah 
      off the list. </P>
      <P>What message does such "diplomacy" send? </P>
      <P>It tells Osama bin Laden that the way to drive a wedge between the 
      Great Satan and the Little Satan is to bomb the World Trade Center and the 
      Pentagon. It tells Yasir Arafat that the Palestinian use of violence and 
      terrorism gets good results from the United States. It also tells him that 
      some people not quite in their right minds, notably at the Department of 
      State and in many chancelleries in Europe, still think that Arafat is both 
      willing and able to deliver a final peace on terms that an Israeli 
      government -- any Israeli government -- could sign. It tells the Arab 
      "street" that the United States shares its view that Israel is guilty of 
      state terrorism, a common if ludicrous belief on that "street." Both to 
      bin Laden and to Arafat, and to all the other sponsors and shelterers of 
      terrorism worldwide, it communicates strategic weakness and moral 
      illiteracy. </P>
      <P>In effect, those who argue that the United States should pressure 
      Israel toward signing a final settlement with Arafat's PLO for the sake of 
      greater good are arguing that Israel should jeopardize its very existence 
      so that the United States can ally with Arab and Muslim states some of 
      which are complicit in terrorism, and whose likely assistance to the 
      United States will run from dubious to temporary to marginal. Those who 
      make such arguments bring joy to Osama bin Laden, who wants nothing more 
      than to harm U.S. allies as part of the campaign to drive the United 
      States from the Middle East. (That is also why, most likely, Al-Qaeda will 
      strike against Turkey if given a chance, and why the refusal of Germany 
      and other West European states to help Turkey in a time of economic 
      difficulty represents such bad judgment.) </P><BR>
      <H4>THE RETURN OF REALISM </H4>
      <P>One conclusion that comes upon us from this brief discussion of the 
      sources of the September 11 attack, and that acts as a kind of bridge from 
      the analysis of the past to a focus on the future, is that those who have 
      said that now, as of September 12, everything is different, everything is 
      changed, and nothing will ever again be the same, are talking pure 
      nonsense. As Owen Harries has put it, the attacks of September 11 were 
      long predicted, long warned against, and were born out of a series of 
      circumstances with which the world has long been pregnant. Moreover, the 
      fact that this attack has ended the American illusion of invulnerability 
      brings us out of our dozen-year long holiday from history, and places us 
      not in a new context but in a very old one: the context of realism. 
      Certainly one thing that clearly has not changed is the tendency of the 
      press to both historical ignorance and irresponsible hyperbole. </P>
      <P>Many have observed that the September 11 attack has given the United 
      States a foreign policy focus, comparable to that of the Cold War, that 
      works as an organizing principle. As such a principle, all other interests 
      tend to be subsumed beneath it. So, for example, rapid, if still shallow, 
      changes in U.S.-Russian relations are made to seem more significant and 
      permanent than they probably are. We now make common cause with detestable 
      regimes, just as dealing with "friendly tyrants" was a justifiable lesser 
      evil during the Cold War. </P>
      <P>Some observers imitate another Cold War-era theme: Communism, many 
      liberals believed, came from poverty and despair, so that economic 
      advancement in the world abroad was the key to winning the Cold War; now 
      many liberals believe that we should mount a Marshall Plan for the Middle 
      East, as radical Islam is similarly attributed to poverty and despair that 
      U.S.-led globalization has helped to create, or at least to worsen. The 
      Cold War variety of this theory was plausible but mostly wrong; the 
      current incarnation of the same theory is simply idiotic. Radical Islam 
      has sprung from economic growth and upward mobility, not the other way 
      around. The Arab terrorists of September 11 were none of them poor or 
      uneducated or from the bottom rungs of their societies. So here again is 
      something that has not changed: the incurable secularized Calvinism of 
      American liberals. </P>
      <P>The truth is that the essential characteristics of our age have not 
      changed because of what happened on September 11. As I laid them out in 
      the Fall 2001 issue of The National Interest ("The Present Opportunity") 
      there are three such characteristics, whose true significance emerges only 
      when the three are seen together. First is the growing realization that, 
      thanks to the actual sources of wealth in science-based economies, 
      economic competitions no longer need lead to security competitions. Second 
      is the preeminence of American power. Third is the enthronement of 
      Wilsonian values as international best practice in all those parts of the 
      world that "work." Each of these characteristics reinforces the other two, 
      and each corresponds to one of the three most popular names for the 
      post-Cold War era: globalization, the unipolar moment, and the "end of 
      history." </P>
      <P>September 11 has not changed the real sources of wealth and power in 
      the world, and the exhibition of American vulnerability has not materially 
      undone the new structure of the international economy. It has tarnished 
      American preeminence but not harmed it seriously, and that tarnish will be 
      wiped away as American wins the war against terrorism. It has, if 
      anything, increased the global commitment to democracy, open economic 
      systems, and limits to the unilateral and aggressive use of force and 
      violence. </P>
      <P>Before September 11, American opportunities outweighed threats. They 
      still do. The attacks against us must be seen as an opportunity to 
      extirpate terrorism as completely as possible, for if there is a next 
      time, with biological or nuclear weapons, our dead will not be measures in 
      thousands but hundreds of thousands. That is why we must do all we can to 
      deprive terrorists of the aid and shelter that states provide. Individuals 
      may be suicidal, but states are not; regimes can be swayed, and when they 
      resist being swayed they can be destroyed. The Taliban must go. So must 
      the Ba'athi regime in Iraq; even Senator Joseph Biden, a man not known for 
      his strategic sagacity, realizes that Ba'athi Iraq will be the 
      unconventional weapons K-Mart of the terrorist world if it is left to 
      stand. </P>
      <P>But beyond the war itself, we must look out for other, more subtle 
      dangers. Will the events of September 11 cause us to define U.S. foreign 
      policy interests in narrowed, more circumscribed ways, in which the 
      opportunity for U.S. global leadership will be abandoned? Will it lead 
      ultimately to the growth of isolationist sentiment? It could, especially 
      if further deadly attacks on the United States occur over a protracted 
      period. But there are few if any signs of this yet, and sound leadership 
      can prevent it. Will it finally lead to a creative energy policy? To a 
      sounder governmental structure for homeland security? To better 
      intelligence and better qualified people wanting to be involved in such 
      careers? To adjustments to the law to make homeland defense and serious 
      intelligence capabilities possible? Quite likely "yes," on all counts, and 
      sound leadership can harvest all these, and other, opportunities. </P>
      <P>What will happen in the days ahead? No one can say for sure, and the 
      law of unintended consequences will surely be at work in any event. But, 
      as Charles Krauthammer has observed, look at the new international line-up 
      and, behold, it is very good. On the enemy's side are fanatical but weak 
      forces, supported and sheltered by not a single major power, or even a 
      single state with a modern economy. On our side, for all near term 
      practical purposes at least, is NATO, Japan, Russia, China, India, and 
      scores of other countries. If we cannot win a war, even an unusual one, 
      with a line-up like that, then we do not deserve to remain a great power. 
      And if we lose, we won't. </P>
      <P>It may be, too, that the positive reshaping of U.S. relations 
      particularly with Russia, China, and India can be nurtured toward 
      something more substantive and long-lasting. That would be a major 
      achievement of U.S. statecraft, for the only thing worse than a situation 
      in which 6,000 Americans can be murdered on a single day is a situation 
      conducive to war among the great powers. If the answer to September 11 
      turns out to be, in the fullness of time, the decisive deepening of peace 
      among the great powers, then we will indeed have turned a great darkness 
      into a greater light. </P>
