Americans, Europeans, and even Israelis, have been calling for a Palestinian 
state run by Yasser Arafat. Far from delivering long-awaited "salvation," such a 
state would only bring Palestinians more misery and death. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Arafat's and the PLO's 
long history of terrorism and violence. Over a span of 35 years, Arafat and the 
PLO have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of Israeli, American, 
Lebanese, and Palestinian civilians. Through the PLO, Arafat has orchestrated 
the kidnapping and murder of Israeli school children, the hijacking of 
airliners, numberless car bombings and death-squad killings. Often Arafat's 
violence has been targeted at his Arab "brothers," as is evidenced by the PLO's 
role in Jordanian (1960s-'70s) and Lebanese (1970s-'80s) civil insurrections. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider also the track record of 
the current Palestinian Authority—the temporary governing body of the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank territories. Arafat is the dictator of the Palestinian Authority 
in everything but title. The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> has described his 
domination as stretching "from the largest to the most minor matter." 
Palestinians live in constant fear of having their property arbitrarily 
confiscated by Arafat's corrupt "police" force. Laws prohibiting free speech are 
common and are enforced brutally. To silence those who oppose him, Arafat shuts 
down radio and TV stations. According to Amnesty International, dissenters are 
arbitrarily detained, tortured, or "encouraged" at gunpoint to leave the 
territories. In November 1999 a group of prominent intellectuals who signed a 
petition accusing Arafat's regime of corruption was summarily jailed. They were 
lucky; some recalcitrants are assassinated. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arafat's current regime is 
barbaric and oppressive. One can logically predict that conditions in an 
independent Palestinian state would be worse than they are presently. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viewed in this context of 
dictatorial rule, the alleged right of Palestinians to "self-determination" is 
groundless. No group has a right to its own state if what it seeks is a 
dictatorship. Arafat's "Palestinian self-determination" really means more of 
Arafat's despotism—it means granting legitimacy to a state that is utterly 
hostile to its own citizens. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
Ayn Rand wrote, "the right of 'the self-determination of nations' applies only 
to free societies or to societies seeking to establish freedom; it does not 
apply to dictatorships." The only legitimate reason to found a new state is to 
escape tyranny and secure freedom. Thus, America's Founding Fathers rightly 
fought for independence from England's oppressive rule; the United States was 
founded on the recognition of individual rights. What Palestinians desire, 
however, is the "right" to be rightless serfs in a state run by a ruthless 
dictator. Nobody has a right to create and maintain such a state. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palestinians would be better off 
staying under Israeli rule (as some Palestinians admit, when safe to do so). To 
the extent that the Arabs living in Israel have accepted Western values such as 
individual responsibility, property rights, and the rule of law, they have 
thrived. The material evidence of that flourishing can be seen in the relatively 
high standard of living found in many Arab villages in Israel. Indeed, 
Palestinians rely on the relative economic freedom and prosperity offered in 
Israel to make a living. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But 
Israel also offers Palestinians more precious values. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Arab country gives its 
inhabitants the liberty to protest, to publish articles and books opposing the 
government (as many Jews and Palestinians do in Israel)? What Arab country has 
free elections or a judicial system in which all are treated equally before the 
law? None. In Israel, Palestinians have more freedom and more economic 
opportunities than they have in any Arab country, and than they could possibly 
have in a future Palestinian state run by the PLO or any other dictatorial 
group. If the choice is between a Palestinian state run by terrorists like 
Arafat and remaining under Israeli rule, the latter is by far the better option. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Palestinians were serious about 
having their own free state, they would start by deposing and arresting Yasser 
Arafat for his crimes against his own people. In place of the terrorists now 
representing them, Palestinians should send to the negotiating table 
representatives who believe in and honor individual rights—leaders who plan to 
establish a free civilized country where violence is abhorred and suppressed. 
Palestinians should treat Israel as an older and wiser neighbor from whom they 
have much to learn, rather than an enemy to be destroyed. Only when Palestinians 
are willing to negotiate with Israel on such terms, will they have earned the 
right to a state of their own.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><B>Dr. Brook is executive director
