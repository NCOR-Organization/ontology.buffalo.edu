        PRESIDENT GENERAL PERVEZ MUSHARAF’S <br>
        ADDRESS TO THE NATION <br>
        ( JANUARY 12, 2002 )</font></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I begin in the name of 
        God, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pakistani Brothers and 
        Sisters!</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">As you would remember, 
        ever since I assumed office, I launched a campaign to rid the society of 
        extremism, violence and terrorism and strived to project Islam in its 
        true perspective. In my first speech on October 17, 1999, I had said and 
        I quote; “Islam teaches tolerance, not hatred; universal brotherhood, 
        not enmity; peace, and not violence. I have a great respect for the 
        Ulema and expect them to come forward and present Islam in its true 
        light. I urge them to curb elements which are exploiting religion for 
        vested interests and bringing a bad name to our faith”.&nbsp; After this, I 
        initiated a number of steps in this regard. First, in the year 2000, I 
        started interacting with the Taliban and counselled them to inculcate 
        tolerance and bring moderation in their ways. I also told them that 
        those terrorists who were involved in terrorist acts in Pakistan and 
        seeking refuge in Afghanistan should be returned to us. Unfortunately, 
        we did not succeed.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the year 2001, I 
        think it was January, we sealed the Pak-Afghan borders and I gave 
        directions that no students of any Madarissah (religious seminaries) 
        should be allowed to cross into Afghanistan without relevant documents. 
        After this, I despatched a number of delegations to meet Mullah Omar.I 
        continued to advise them tolerance and balance. Later, on February 15, 
        2001, we promulgated the Anti-Weaponisation Ordinance. Through this law, 
        we launched a de-weaponisation campaign in Pakistan.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">On 5<sup>th</sup> of 
        June, on the occasion of the Seerat Conference, I addressed Ulema 
        belonging to all Schools of thought and spoke firmly to them against 
        religious extremism. On the 14<sup>th</sup> of August 2001, we finally 
        took a very important decision to ban Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Muhammad 
        and placed Sipah-e-Sahaba and TJP (Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan) under 
        observation. In addition, on a number of occasions, I called Ulema and 
        Mashaikh and held extensive consultations with them. The objective was 
        to take them on board in our campaign against terrorism and extremism. 
        These measures have been continuing since our government assumed office 
        in 1999. I am explaining all this to you in great detail only because of 
        the fact that the campaign against extremism undertaken by us from the 
        very beginning is in our own national interest. We are not doing this 
        under advice or pressure from anyone. Rather, we are conscious that it 
        is in our national interest. &nbsp;We are conscious that we need to rid 
        society of extremism and this is being done right from the beginning.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">This domestic reforms 
        process was underway when a terrorist attack took place against the 
        United States on the 11<sup>th</sup> of September. This terrorist act 
        led to momentous changes all over the world. We decided to join the 
        international coalition against terrorism and in this regard I have 
        already spoken to you on a number of occasions. We took this decision on 
        principles and in our national interest.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">By the grace of God 
        Almighty our decision was absolutely correct. Our intentions were noble 
        and God Almighty helped us. I am happy to say that the vast majority of 
        Pakistanis stood by this decision and supported our decision. I am proud 
        of the realistic decision of our nation. What really pains me is that 
        some religious extremist parties and groups opposed this decision. What 
        hurts more was that their opposition was not based on principles. At a 
        critical juncture in our history, they preferred their personal and 
        party interests over national interests.&nbsp; They tried their utmost to 
        mislead the nation, took out processions and resorted to agitation. But 
        their entire efforts failed. The people of Pakistan frustrated their 
        designs. As I have said, I am proud of the people of Pakistan who 
        support correct decisions and do not pay heed to those who try to 
        mislead them.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I have interacted with 
        the religious scholars on a number of occasions and exchanged views with 
        them. I am happy to say that our discussions have been very fruitful. A 
        majority of them are blessed with wisdom and vision and they do not mix 
        religion with politics. Some extremists, who were engaged in protests, 
        are people who try to monopolise and attempt to propagate their own 
        brand of religion.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">They think as if others 
        are not Muslims. These are the people who considered the Taliban to be a 
        symbol of Islam and that the Taliban were bringing Islamic rennaissance 
        or were practising the purest form of Islam.. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">They behaved as if the 
        Northern Alliance, against whom the Taliban were fighting, were 
        non-Muslims! Whereas, in fact, both were Muslims and believers. These 
        extremists were those people who do not talk of “Haqooqul Ibad” 
        (obligations towards fellow human beings). They do not talk of these 
        obligations because practising them demands self-sacrifice. How will 
        they justify their Pajeros and expensive vehicles? I want to ask these 
        extremists as to who was responsible for misleading thousands of 
        Pakistanis to their massacre in Afghanistan? These misled people were 
        let down by the very people in whose support they had gone. All of us 
        should learn a lesson from this. We must remember that we are 
        Pakistanis. Pakistan is our identity, our motherland. We will be aliens 
        outside Pakistan and be treated as aliens. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pakistan is our land. 
        It is our soil. If we forsake it, we will face difficulties. This lesson 
        we must learn.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Sectarian terrorism has 
        been going on for years. Everyone of us is fed up of it. It is becoming 
        unbearable. Our peace-loving people are keen to get rid of the 
        Klashinkov and weapon culture. Every one is sick of it. It was because 
        of this that we banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Muhammad. &nbsp;Yet 
        little improvement occurred. The day of reckoning has come. Do we want 
        Pakistan to become a theocratic state? Do we believe that religious 
        education alone is enough for governance or do we want Pakistan to 
        emerge as a progressive and dynamic Islamic welfare state? The verdict 
        of the masses is in favour of a progressive Islamic state. This 
        decision, based on the teaching of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) 
        and in line with the teachings of Quaid-e-Azam and Allama Iqbal will put 
        Pakistan on the path of progress and prosperity. Let us honestly analyse 
        what the few religious extremists have attempted to do with Pakistan and 
        Islam.&nbsp; First, with regard to Afghanistan, they indulged in agitational 
        activities. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Look at the damage it 
        has caused! Pakistan’s international image was tarnished and we were 
        projected by the international media as ignorant and backward. Our 
        economy suffered. A number of export orders already placed with 
        Pakistani industry were cancelled and no new orders materialised. &nbsp;This 
        led to closure of some factories and unemployment. The poor daily wage 
        earners lost their livelihood. Extremists also formed a 
        Pakistan-Afghanistan Defence Council! Apart from damaging Pakistan, they 
        had negative thinking and had no idea of anything good for Afghanistan. 
        Did they ever think of bringing about peace to Afghanistan through 
        reconciliation among the Taliban and Northern Alliance? Did they counsel 
        tolerance to them? Did they ever think of collecting funds for the 
        welfare, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war-ravaged 
        Afghanistan, or to mitigate sufferings of the poor Afghan people? Did 
        they think of a solution to the hunger, poverty and destruction in 
        Afghanistan? To my knowledge, only Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi, God bless 
        him, and some foreign NGOs and the UN organisations were providing the 
        Afghans with food and medicines. These extremists did nothing except 
        contributing to bloodshed in Afghanistan. I ask of them, whether they 
        know any thing other then disruption and sowing seeds of hatred? Does 
        Islam preach this?</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, let us see their 
        activity outside Afghanistan. They initiated sectarian feuds.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Sects and different 
        schools of thought in Islam have existed since long. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is nothing wrong 
        with intellectual differences flowing from freedom of thought as long as 
        such differences remain confined to intellectual debates. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Look at what this 
        extremist minority is doing? They are indulging in fratricidal killings. 
        There is no tolerance among them. Quaid-e-Azam declared that Pakistan 
        belonged to followers of all religions; that every one would be treated 
        equally. However, what to speak of other religions, Muslims have started 
        killing each other.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I think, these people 
        have declared more Muslims as Kafirs (infidels) than motivating the 
        non-Muslims to embrace Islam. Look at the damage they have caused? They 
        have murdered a number of our highly qualified doctors, engineers, civil 
        servants and teachers who were pillars of our society. &nbsp;Who has 
        suffered? The families of the dead, no doubt. But a greater loss was 
        inflicted on Pakistan because, as I said, we lost the pillars of our 
        society. These extremists did not stop here. They started killing other 
        innocent people in mosques and places of worship.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Today, people are 
        scared of entering these sacred places of worship. &nbsp;It is a matter of 
        shame that police have to be posted outside for their protection. We 
        claim Islam as Deen or a complete way of life.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Is this the way of life 
        that Islam teaches us? That we fight amongst ourselves and feel scared 
        of fellow Muslims, scared of visiting our places of worship where police 
        have to be deputed outside for protection? &nbsp;Mosques are being misused 
        for propagating and inciting hatred against each other’s sect and 
        beliefs and against the Government, too.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I would like to inform 
        you that a number of terrorist rings have been apprehended. In Karachi, 
        the Inspector General of Police, while briefing me, informed that the 
        leader of one of these groups is the Pesh Imam (Prayer Leader) of a 
        Mosque in Malir. The Imam has confessed to murdering many people 
        himself. This is the state of affairs. To what purpose are we using our 
        mosques for? These people have made a state within a state and have 
        challenged the writ of the government.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, I would like to 
        dwell upon the subject of Madaris or Religious Schools in some detail. 
        These schools are excellent welfare set-ups where the poor get free 
        board and lodge. In my opinion, no NGO can match their welfare aspects. 
        Many of the madaris are imparting excellent education. In addition to 
        religious teachings, other subjects such as science education and 
        computer training are also being imparted there.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am thankful to them 
        for undertaking excellent welfare measures without State funding. I 
        would also like to say that I have projected madaris internationally and 
        with various heads of states time and again.&nbsp; I think no one else in 
        Pakistan has done so much for their cause. &nbsp;However,there are some 
        negative aspects of some madrassahs. These few impart only religious 
        education and such education which produces semi-literate religious 
        scholars. This is a weakness. Very few madaris, I repeat very few of 
        them, are under the influence of politico-religious parties or have been 
        established by them. I know that some of these promote negative thinking 
        and propagate hatred and violence instead of inculcating tolerance, 
        patience and fraternity. We must rememeber that historically, the 
        madarasa was&nbsp; a prestigious seat of learning. They were citadels of 
        knowledge and beacon of light for the world.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">When Islam was at its 
        zenith, every discipline of learning e.g.: </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">mathematics, science, 
        medicine, astronomy and jurisprudence were taught at these institutions. 
        Great muslims luminaries such as Al-Beruni, Ibn-e-Sina (Avesina) and Ibn 
        Khuldoon, were the products of these same madaris.&nbsp; And if we study 
        history, we see that from the 7<sup>th</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> century 
        AD, transfer of technology took place from the Muslims to the rest of 
        the world. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Look at Muslims’ 
        condition today. Islam teaches us to seek knowledge, even if it involved 
        travel to China. I am sure you are aware that the Prophet&nbsp; (Peace Be 
        Upon Him) had told prisoners of war in the&nbsp; Battle of Badar that they 
        would be set free if each of them imparted education to ten Muslims.
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Quite obviously, this 
        education could not have been religious education as the prisoners were 
        non-Muslims. So the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) was actually referring 
        to worldly education. If we do not believe in education, are we 
        following the teachings of Islam or violating them? We must ask what 
        direction are we being led into by these extremists?&nbsp; The writ of the 
        government is being challenged. Pakistan has been made a soft state 
        where the supremacy of law is questioned. This situation can not be 
        tolerated any more. The question is what is the correct path? First of 
        all, we must rid the society of sectarian hatred and terrorism, promote 
        mutual harmony. Remember that mindsets can not be changed through force 
        and coercion. No idea can ever be forcibly thrust upon any one. May be 
        the person changes outwardly but minds and hearts can never be converted 
        by force. Real change can be brought about through personal example, 
        exemplary character and superior intellect. It can be brought about by 
        Haqooq-ul-ibad (Obligation towards fellow beings).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Have we forgotten the 
        example of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) where Islam was spread 
        by virtue of his personal conduct, true leadership and that is how 
        changes in the world took place at that time. We have forgotten the 
        teaching of revered personalities of Islam like Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh, 
        Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Fareed Ganj Shakar, Baha-uddin Zakria&nbsp; etc.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Was Islam spread by 
        them through force and coercion? No. They preached Islam by personal 
        example. I give these examples because it hurts me to see where we have 
        relegated ourselves now. We must restore that status of Madaris to what 
        it originally was. We have to change the state of affairs and take them 
        on the path of improvement.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The second thing I want 
        to talk about is the concept&nbsp; of Jehad in its totality. I want to dilate 
        upon it because it is a contentious issue, requiring complete 
        comprehension and understanding. In Islam, Jehad is not confined to 
        armed struggles only. Have we ever thought of waging Jehad against 
        illiteracy, poverty, backwardness and hunger? This is the larger Jehad. 
        Pakistan, in my opinion, needs to wage Jehad against&nbsp; these evils.
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">After the battle of 
        Khyber, the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) stated that Jehad-e-Asghar 
        (Smaller Jehad) is over but Jehad-e-Akbar (Greater Jehad) has begun. 
        This meant that armed Jehad i.e. the smaller Jehad was now over and the 
        greater Jehad against backwardness and illiteracy had started. </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pakistan needs 
        Jehad-e-Akbar at this juncture.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">By the way we must 
        remember that only the government of the day and not every individual 
        can proclaim armed Jehad. The extremist minority must realise that 
        Pakistan is not responsible of waging armed Jehad in the world. </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I feel that in addition 
        to Haqooq Allah (Obligations to God), we should also focus on 
        Haqooq-Al-ebad (Obligations towards fellow human beings). At Schools, 
        Colleges and Madaris, Obligations towards fellow beings should be 
        preached. We know that we have totally ignored the importance of correct 
        dealings with fellow humans beings. There is no room for feuds in 
        Islamic teachings. It is imperative that we teach true Islam i.e. 
        tolerance, forgiveness, compassion, justice, fair play, amity and 
        harmony, which is the true spirit of Islam. We must adopt this. We must 
        shun negative thinking.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We have formulated a 
        new strategy for Madaris and there is need to implement it so as to 
        galvanize their good aspects and remove their drawbacks. We have 
        developed a new syllabi for them providing for teaching of Pakistan 
        studies, Mathematics, Science and English along with religious 
        subjects.&nbsp; Even if we want these Madaris to produce religious leaders 
        they should be educated along these lines. Such people will command more 
        respect in the society because they will be better qualified. To me, 
        students of religious schools should be brought in to the mainstream of 
        society. If any one of them opts to join college or university, he would 
        have the option of being equipped with the modern education. If a child 
        studying at a madrasa does not wish to be a prayer leader and he wants 
        to be a bank official or seek employment elsewhere, he should be 
        facilitated.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">It would mean that the 
        students of Madaris should be brought to the mainstream through a better 
        system of education. This is the crux of the Madrasa strategy.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">This by no means is an 
        attempt to bring religious educational institutions under Govt control 
        nor do we want to spoil the excellent attributes of these institutions. 
        My only aim is to help these institutions in over coming their 
        weaknesses and providing them with better facilities and more avenues to 
        the poor children at these institutions.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We must check abuse of 
        mosques and madaris and they must not be used for spreading political 
        and sectarian prejudices. We want to ensure that mosques enjoy freedom 
        and we are here to maintain it. At the same time we expect a display of 
        responsibility along with freedom. If the Imam of mosques fail to 
        display responsibility, curbs would have to be placed on them. After 
        this analysis, now, I come to some conclusions and decisions: - First, 
        we have to establish the writ of the Government. All organizations in 
        Pakistan will function in a regulated manner. No individual, 
        organization or Party will be allowed to break law of the land. The 
        internal environment has to be improved.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Maturity and 
        equilibrium have to be established in the society. We have to promote an 
        environment of tolerance, maturity, responsibility, patience and 
        understanding. We have to check extremism, militancy, violence and 
        fundamentalism. We will have to forsake the atmosphere of hatred and 
        anger. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We have to stop 
        exploitation of simple poor people of the country and not to incite them 
        to fueds and violence. We must concern ourselves with our own country.&nbsp; 
        Pakistan comes first. We do not need to interfere and concern ourselves 
        with others. There is no need to interfere in other countries.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now I turn to other 
        important issues. In my view there are three problems causing conflict 
        and agitation in our minds. They include; first the Kashmir Cause, 
        secondly all political disputes at the international level concerning 
        Muslims and thirdly internal sectarian disputes and differences.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">These are the three 
        problems which create confusion in our minds. I want to lay down rules 
        of behaviour concerning all the three.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Let us take the Kashmir 
        Cause first. Kashmir runs in our blood. No Pakistani can afford to sever 
        links with Kashmir. The entire Pakistan and the world knows this. We 
        will continue to extend our moral, political and diplomatic support to 
        Kashmiris. We will never budge an inch from our principle stand on 
        Kashmir. The Kashmir problem needs to be resolved by dialogue and 
        peaceful means in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and 
        the United Nations resolutions. We have to find the solution of this 
        dispute. No organization will be allowed to indulge in terrorism in the 
        name of Kashmir. We condemn the terrorist acts of September 11, October 
        1 and December 13.&nbsp; Anyone found involved in any terrorist act would be 
        dealt with sternly.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Strict action will be 
        taken against any Pakistani individual, group or organization found 
        involved in terrorism within or outside the country. &nbsp;Our behaviour must 
        always be in accordance with international norms.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">On this occasion, as 
        President of Pakistan, I want to convey a message to Prime Minister 
        Vajpaee: If we want to normalize relations between Pakistan and India 
        and bring harmony to the region, the Kashmir dispute will have to be 
        resolved peacefully through a dialogue on the basis of the aspirations 
        of the Kashmiri people. Solving the Kashmir Issue is the joint 
        responsibility of our two countries.&nbsp; Let me repeat some of the 
        observations made by you, Mr. Vajpayee, some time back, and I quote: 
        “Mind-sets will have to be altered and historical baggage will have to 
        be jettisoned. I take you on this offer. Let us start talking in this 
        very spirit.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now as Commander of the 
        Armed Forces of Pakistan, I wish to convey another message. The Armed 
        Forces of Pakistan are fully prepared and deployed to meet any 
        challenge. They will spill the last drop of their blood in the defence 
        of their country. Let there be no attempt of crossing the border in any 
        sector as it will be met with full force. Do not entertain any illusions 
        on this count.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I would also like to 
        address the international community, particularly the United States on 
        this occasion. As I said before on a number of occasions, Pakistan 
        rejects and condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestation.
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pakistan will not allow 
        its territory to be used for any terrorist activity anywhere in the 
        world. Now you must play an active role in solving the Kashmir dispute 
        for the sake of lasting peace and harmony in the region. We should be 
        under no illusion that the legitimate demand of the people of Kashmir 
        can ever be suppressed without their just resolution. Kashmiris also 
        expect that you ask India to bring an end to state terrorism and human 
        rights violations. Let human rights organizations, Amnesty 
        International, the international media and U.N. peacekeepers be allowed 
        to monitor activities of the Indian occupation forces.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now we come to the 
        second problem, which causes confusion in our minds and is of our 
        particular concern. It relates to conflicts involving Muslims. Our 
        religious leaders involve themselves in such conflicts without giving 
        serious thought to them. I don’t want to talk at length on this.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is for the 
        government to take a position on international issues. &nbsp;Individuals, 
        organizations and political parties should restrict their activities to 
        expression of their views. I request them to express their views on 
        international issues in an intellectual spirit and in a civilized manner 
        through force of argument.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Views expressed with 
        maturity and moderation have greater convincing power. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Expressing views in a 
        threatening manner does not create any positive effect and anyone who 
        indulges in hollow threats is taken as an unbalanced person by the world 
        at large.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I would request that we 
        should stop interfering in the affairs of others. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">First, we should attain 
        the strength and the importance where our views carry weight when we 
        express them.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now we come to internal 
        decisions.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The third issue causing 
        conflict in our minds relates to sectarian </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">differences. As I have 
        already pointed out that writ of the Government will be established. No 
        individual, organization or party will be allowed to break the law of 
        the land. All functioning will be in a regulated manner and within 
        rules.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now I come to the 
        extremist organizations. Terrorism, and sectarianism must come to an 
        end. I had announced a ban on Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Mohammad on 
        14 August last year. On that occasion, I had pointed out that 
        Sipah-e-Sahaba and TJP would be kept under observation.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am sorry to say that 
        there is not much improvement in the situation. &nbsp;Sectarian violence 
        continues unabated. We have busted several gangs involved in sectarian 
        killings. You would be astonished to know that in year 2001 about 400 
        innocent people fell victim to sectarian and other killings.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Many of the gangs 
        apprehended include people mostly belonging to Sipah-e-Sahaba and some 
        to TJP. This situation cannot be tolerated any more. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I, therefore, announce 
        banning of both Sipah-e-Sahaba and TJP. In addition to these, TNSM (Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat 
        Mohammadi) being responsible for misleading thousands of simple poor 
        people into Afghanistan also stands banned.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">This organization is 
        responsible for their massacre in Afghanistan. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Government has also 
        decided to put the Sunni Tehreek under observation. &nbsp;No organization is 
        allowed to form Lashkar, Sipah or Jaish. The Government has banned Jaish-e-Mohammad 
        and Lashkar-e-Taiba.&nbsp; Any organization or individual would face strict 
        punitive measures if found inciting the people to violence in internal 
        or external contexts.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our mosques are sacred 
        places where we seek the blessings of God Almighty. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Let them remain sacred. 
        We will not allow the misuse of mosques. All mosques will be registered 
        and no new mosques will be built without permission. &nbsp;The use of 
        loudspeakers will be limited only to call for prayers, and Friday Sermon 
        and Vaaz. However, I would like to emphasise that special permission is 
        being given for “Vaaz” (Sermon). If this is misused the permission will 
        be cancelled.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If there is any 
        political activity, inciting of sectarian hatred or propagation of 
        extremism in any mosque, the management would be held responsible and 
        proceeded against according to law.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I appeal to all Pesh 
        Imams to project the qualities of Islam in the mosques and invite the 
        people to piety. Talk of obligations towards fellow beings, exhort them 
        to abstain from negative thoughts and promote positive thinking. I hope 
        that all Nazims, Distt. Police officers and Auqaf Department officials 
        will take quick action against violators of these measures.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">On Madaris, a detailed 
        policy will be issued through a new Madressa Ordinance. The Ordinance 
        will be issued in a few days. I feel happy that the Madressa policy has 
        been finalized in consultation with religious scholars and Mashaikh. I 
        have touched on the merits and shortcomings prevailing in the Madaris. 
        Merits have to be reinforced while shortcomings have to be rooted out.&nbsp; 
        Under the Madressa policy, their functioning will be regulated. </font>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">These Madaris will be 
        governed by same rules and regulations applicable to other schools, 
        colleges and universities. All Madaris will be registered by 23<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp; 
        March 2002 and no new Madressa will be opened without permission of the 
        Government.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If any Madressa 
        (religious school) is found indulging in extremism, subversion, militant 
        activity or possessing any types of weapons, it will be closed. All 
        Madaaris will have to adopt the new syllabi by the end of this year. 
        Those Madaris which are already following such syllabi are welcome to 
        continue. The Government has decided to provide financial assistance to 
        such Madaris. The government will also help the Madaris in the training 
        of their teachers. The Ministry of Education has been instructed to 
        review courses of Islamic education in all schools and colleges also 
        with a view to improving them. So far as foreign students attending 
        Madaris are concerned, we have set rules for them.&nbsp; Foreign students who 
        do not have proper documents would be required to comply with the 
        formalities by 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2002 otherwise they can face 
        deportation.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Any foreigner wanting 
        to attend Madaris in Pakistan will have to obtain required documents 
        from his/her native country and NOC from the government. </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Only then, he or she 
        will get admission. The same rules will apply to foreign teachers.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some Ulema were of the 
        view that some poor people who come to Pakistan for religious education 
        should not be deported to the countries of their origin.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree that this is a 
        genuine demand but such people should regularize their stay in Pakistan 
        through their respective embassies. As I have said, all such activity 
        has to be regulated and the writ of the Government must be established.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">With a view to ending 
        conflict, I have explained to you at great length the three areas 
        causing confusion in our minds. Making rules, regulations and issuing 
        ordinances is easy but their implementation is difficult. &nbsp;However, I 
        feel all the measures I have announced are of utmost importance. We have 
        to implement them. In this regard, the law enforcement agencies 
        including police must perform their duty.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We are introducing 
        reforms in the police with a view to improving their efficiency. A great 
        responsibility lies on their shoulders.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I have directed the 
        police to ensure implementation of the steps announced by the government 
        and I have no doubt they will be motivated to perform their duty. After 
        reforms we expect they will be better trained and equipped to discharge 
        their duty. Rangers and civil armed forces will be in their support.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We are also taking 
        steps in consultation with the judiciary for speedy trial of cases 
        relating to terrorism and extremism. Anti terrorist courts are being 
        strengthened and necessary orders will be issued in a few days.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Apart from these 
        issues, I would also like to inform you, my brothers and sisters, that 
        we have been sent a list of 20 people by India.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">I want to clear our 
        position on this. There is no question of handing over any Pakistani.&nbsp; 
        This will never be done.&nbsp; If we are given evidence against those people, 
        we will take action against them in Pakistan under our own laws. As far 
        as non-Pakistanis are concerned, we have not given asylum to any one. 
        Any one falling under this category will be proceeded against whenever 
        one is found.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">My brothers &amp; Sisters,</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Pakistan is an Islamic 
        Republic. There are 98 percent Muslims living in this country. We should 
        live like brothers and form an example for rest of the Islamic 
        countries. We should strive to emerge as a responsible and progressive 
        member of the comity of nations.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We have to make 
        Pakistan into a powerful and strong country. We have resources and 
        potential. We are capable of meeting external danger. We have to 
        safeguard ourselves against internal dangers. I have always been saying 
        that internal strife is eating us like termite.&nbsp; Don’t forget that 
        Pakistan is the citadel of Islam and if we want to serve Islam well we 
        will first have to make Pakistan strong and powerful. There is a race 
        for progress among all nations.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">We cannot achieve 
        progress through a policy of confrontation and feuds.&nbsp; We can achieve 
        progress through human resource development, mental enlightenment, high 
        moral character and technological development. I appeal to all my 
        countrymen to rise to the occasion. We should get rid of intolerance and 
        hatred and instead promote tolerance and harmony.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">May God guide us to act 
        upon the true teachings of Islam. May He help us to follow the 
        Quaid-e-Azam’s motto:&nbsp; “Unity, Faith and Discipline”.&nbsp; This should 
        always be remembered. We will be a non-entity without unity.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">And I would again like 
        to recite a couplet from Allama Iqbal.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Fard Qaim Rabte Millat 
        Say Hai Tanha Kuch Naheen.</font></p>
