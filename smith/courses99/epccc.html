  <p>This is an experimental course, constructed around both face-to-face 
seminars and intensive use of the internet. It will simultaneously involve 
students from both Buffalo and Budapest, and is designed as an experiment 
in cross-cultural communication devoted to the philosophical analysis of the
topic of cross-cultural communication. Topics dealt with will include: The
history of philosophy from the point of view of changes in technologies and
modes of communication. The organization of ideas and the organization of
societies. Tradition and authority in pre-literate societies. The rise of
individuality and democracy in the literate and typographic ages. The public
domain and democracy in a networked society. Communities, local cultures,
and globalization. English as a world language. The ethics of online communities:
rules, cohesion, expulsion. The geography of cross-cultural communication.
Alternatives to the nation state. Conservatism and anarchism revisited: rights
and rules, freedom and command, hierarchies, power and authority. Censorship,
content control, access to information, copyright, intellectual property.
Anonymity, identity, privacy, and confidentiality in cyberspace. The educational
potentials of the global information infrastructure. The ethical responsibility
of information professionals. </p>
