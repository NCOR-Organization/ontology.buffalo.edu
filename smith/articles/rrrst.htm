<blockquote>
<blockquote>What sort of set theory results when restrictions are placed
on the sorts of elements which may form a set? Given an arbitrary relevance
relation, one can formulate a notion of set which will apply only to totalities
of mutually relevant entities. Relevance might signify for example: exists
at the same time as, belongs to the same body as, is less than a certain
distance from, etc. The resultant theory, which embodies topological constraints,
can then be used as the basis for an account of relevance between propositions
which is in the tradition of the relevant logics of analytic implication
studied by M. Dunn and W. T. Parry.
