<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">From: K. Lehrer and J. C. Marek
(eds.), <i>Austrian Philosophy Past and Present </i>(Boston Studies in
the Philosophy of Science), Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster: Kluwer, 1996, 1-20.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">1. 'The Philosophy of the Twentieth
Century'</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It will be useful to begin by considering
that peculiar creature of the North-American university which goes by the
name of 'Continental philosophy'. There are many hundreds of courses with
this title taught each year in universities throughout the United States
and Canada - a practice that is questionable, to say the least, given that
such courses prove on examination to deal not with philosophy on the continent
of Europe as a whole, but rather with a highly selective slice of
<i>Franco-German</i>
philosophy, a slice which sometimes seems to include Heidegger as its sole
fixed point. Around him is gathered a slowly rotating crew of currently
fashionable, primarily French thinkers, each successive generation of which
claims itself the 'end' of philosophy (or of 'man', or of 'reason', of
'the subject', of 'identity') as we know it, and competes with its predecessors
in the wildness of the antics with which it sets out to support such claims.
The later Husserl, Heidegger's teacher, is sometimes taken account of in
courses of this Continental philosophy; not, however, Husserl's own teacher
Brentano, and not, for example, such important twentieth-century German
philosophers as Ernst Cassirer or Nicolai Hartmann. French philosophers
working in the tradition of Poincar&eacute; (or Bergson or Gilson) are
similarly ignored, as, of course, are Polish or Scandinavian or Czech philosophers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What, then, is the moment of unity of this
'Continental philosophy'? What is it that Heidegger and, say, Derrida or
Luce Irigaray have in common which distinguishes them from phenomenologists
such as Reinach or Ingarden or the famous Daubert? The answer, it seems,
is: <i>antipathy to science</i>, or more generally: antipathy to learning,
to scholarly and investigative activity, to all the normal bourgeois purposes
of the modern university. This is combined - in the case, certainly, of
all French thinkers accredited as 'Continental philosophers' - with a substitution
of politics for science (the former understood, again, in a somewhat generalized
sense). Philosophy, since Heidegger, who all but terminated the previously
healthy scientific line in phenomenology, becomes an only lightly disguised
form of ideologically motivated social criticism, the disguise taking the
form of styles of writing which - in their heady mixture of elements derived
from near pornography and pseudo-scientific jargonizing inspired by sociology
and psychoanalysis - have to be seen to be believed.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">2. Austrian Philosophy</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">Here, however, it is the fate of philosophy in <i>Austria</i>
which is our primary concern, and the first thing which strikes us on turning
to this topic is the extent to which philosophers from Austria have fared
so badly as concerns their admission into the pantheon of 'Continental
philosophers'. Why should this be so? Why, to put the question from the
other side, should there be so close an association in Austria between
philosophy and science? Bernard Bolzano, Ernst Mach, Ludwig Boltzmann,
Ludwig Wittgenstein, Ludwik Fleck, Vienna Circle, Karl Popper, Michael
Polanyi, Paul Feyerabend, Wolfgang Stegm&uuml;ller, Rudolf Haller, is after
all an impressive list, however much one might disagree with the views
and platforms of some of the individual figures mentioned.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Before canvassing an answer to this, our principal
question, it is necessary to point out that even in Austria - and even
in the innermost thickets of the Vienna Circle - the strictly scientific
orientation was not without admixtures of a political sort. Indeed when
the Vienna Circle manifesto was published in 1929 under the title "Scientific
Conception of the World", Moritz Schlick, to whom the work was dedicated,
was dissatisfied with the result precisely because he was not taken by
the conception of the circle as a 'movement' of any sort, favouring a more
modest and more strictly scientific approach. As Heinrich Neider puts it
in his interview with Haller and Rutte of 1977: 'Schlick hated everything
that smacked of agitation, was against it all'. And in Schlick's own words:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><font face="Times">It is not necessary for us to agitate: that
we can leave to the political parties: in science we say what we have found,
we hope to say the truth; and if it is the truth, then it will win out.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup></font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times">Or, as Thomas Masaryk expressed it in the words
he chose in 1918 as the State Motto of the new Czechoslovak Republic: <i>the
truth shall prevail!</i></font>
<p><font face="Times">Neurath, on the other hand, someone who would one
year later serve in the central planning office of the erstwhile Bavarian
Soviet Republic, propounded
<i>agitation</i>. He, it seems, was a person
who</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">looked at everything - ideas as well as
facts - through an often distorting lens of socialist philosophy and with
an eye to the possible effects of the ideas and facts on a socialization
of society. I have never seen a scholar as consistently obsessed with an
idea and an ideal as Neurath. (Menger 1994, p. 60)</font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times">For the 'proletarian front', as Neurath puts
it, 'military technique and propaganda-interest coincide with the holding
high of science and the overcoming of metaphysics'.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">3. Truth vs. Agitation</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">There is indeed a subtle tension by which the practice
of scientific philosophy in Austria has been marked since its inception
in the work of Bolzano, the tension between <i>science</i>, on the one
hand, and <i>politics</i>, on the other; between <i>truth</i> and <i>agitation</i>
- or between <i>Schlick</i> and <i>Neurath</i>, as we might also say -
a tension whose subtlety derives from the fact that it is <i>truth</i>
or <i>science</i> on whose behalf such agitation is incited. The tension
is present in the very system of higher education in Austria, under which
successive Ministers of Science (and even, most strikingly in the case
of Brentano, the Emperor himself) have played an important role in appointing
- and disappointing - university professors in their posts. But the tension
is present also, and more importantly for our purposes, in the very talk
of 'Austrian philosophy' - as also in talk of 'Continental' or 'French'
or 'Polish' or even 'women's' philosophy - talk which smacks not a little
of earlier talk (of 'Aryan' chemistry, and the like) of a sort which should
surely be anathema to those who have embraced the scientific conception
of the world and who believe that it is the truth that we should be striving
to find, and that, if it is the truth, then it will win out.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Some, however, have defended the thesis that Viennese
positivism ought to be viewed precisely in a political light. In particular
the Viennese sociologist-historian Friedrich Stadler has provided a large
body of documentation to support a case along these lines. Stadler suggests
that we see the University of Vienna in the interwar period as split into
'two camps':</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">on the one side, in the realm of scientific
philosophy, there dominated democratic (enlightenment, liberal, socialist)
tendencies; on the other side there was a spectrum of almost all forms
of anti-democratic feeling, from neo-romantic conservatism to fascist-totalitarian
outgrowths. Thus it is tempting to see philosophical life [in interwar
Vienna] as part of the fierce party-political <i>Kulturkampf</i> of the
time, between the bourgeois camp and the workers' movement (Stadler 1979,
p. 42).<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">A similar thesis is defended by Ayer, who encountered
the Vienna Circle on his honeymoon in Austria in 1932:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">The members of the Vienna Circle, with the
notable exception of Otto Neurath, were not greatly interested in politics,
but theirs was also a political movement. The war of ideas which they were
waging against the Catholic church had its part in the perennial Viennese
conflict between the socialists and the clerical reaction. (Ayer 1977,
p. 129)</font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times">And as Dvorak formulates the matter, citing Neurath:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">In light of the fact that the bourgeoisie
- especially in Central Europe - had discharged itself of all enlightenment
traditions and paid homage rather to the cults of irrationalism, while
the proletariat struggled for a rational formation of society, the hope
certainly prevailed that "It is precisely the proletariat which will become
the carrier of a science without metaphysics". (1985, p. 142)<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">In regard to Austrian society in general between the
wars, the 'two camp' thesis has a certain plausibility. It can on no account,
however, be translated into a thesis according to which the flowering of
scientific philosophy in interwar Vienna might be accounted for by regarding
the work of the Schlick circle as a manifestation of Austrian socialism,
or of anti-clericalism, or as a part of 'a non-capitalist socialization
of science, a radical democratization of science'.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Socialist anti-clericalism did not, after all, lead
to similar phenomena in France, or Spain, or Italy. Moreover, the too slavish
adherence to the two camp thesis has led on the part of its adherents to
an undervaluation of the role, discussed at greater length below, of the
Brentanists and other groups far from socialism in preparing the ground
for scientific philosophy in Vienna and elsewhere in the decades preceding
the founding of the Vienna circle. More importantly still, the thesis is
not able to cope with the fact that so few important Austrian philosophers
of science, and not even a majority of the members of the Vienna Circle,
were of socialist persuasion.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Indeed as far as the philosophers in interwar Vienna
are concerned we must be careful to distinguish three groups: the left
(Neurath and his brother-in-law Hahn), the right ('Christian socialists',
Othmar Spann, <i>et al</i>., otherwise dominant in the University, especially
in the medical and legal faculties), and those of an English-style liberal
persuasion (Schlick, Mises, Popper, Hayek) in between.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">This third group, as history proved, enjoyed under
the then obtaining circumstances a highly tenuous position. (When, in 1936,
Schlick was shot by a paranoiac former student on the steps to the auditorium
of the University of Vienna, newspapers close to the government saw the
incident as a response to Schlick's 'corrosive' philosophy.) Yet its ideas
have shown themselves in the longer run to be of first importance.</font>
<p><font face="Times">It was Neurath's conspicuous advocacy of crackpot
schemes for 'international planning for freedom' associated with the project
of an 'economy in kind' as a substitute for prices and markets which dissuaded
Hayek from making overtures to the Schlick group after his interest had
been sparked by his friend and fellow member of the Ludwig von Mises circle
Felix Kaufmann.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">As already the case of Schlick himself makes clear,
however, it would be overly simplistic to see the circle in particular
or Viennese scientific philosophy in general as in any sense a part of
the Austrian socialist movement. Certainly it is interesting that Austrian
scientific philosophy (and above all the thought of Mach) exerted some
influence upon Austro-Marxists such as Friedrich Adler. Another Austro-Marxist,
Otto Bauer, came to value the work of the Vienna circle enough to view
logical positivism as pointing the way forward for Marxist materialism
itself. But the idea of a two camp theory which would align all honest,
scientifically-minded thinkers in Vienna with progressivism, positivism
and the Viennese socialist city government, and would have them standing
opposed to Catholicism, fascism and other dark forces, breaks down precisely
when confronted with liberal or conservative intellectuals such as Schlick,
Kraft, Waismann, Menger, Kaufmann and even Wittgenstein.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">4. The Late Flowering of Liberalism</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">How, then, are we to explain the dominance of an
analytic, scientific orientation of philosophy in Austria, and especially
in Vienna between the wars? One answer to this question, due to J. C. Ny&iacute;ri,
might read as follows. Austria, by the end of the nineteenth century, clearly
lagged behind its more developed Western neighbours in matters of intellect
and science. The Empire, it is often held,<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup></font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">had witnessed a relatively late process
of urbanization, bringing also a late development of those liberal habits
and values which would seem to be a presupposition of the modern, scientific
attitude. It therefore lacked institutions of scientific research of the
sort that had been founded in Germany since the time of von Humboldt. On
the other hand, as more liberal ways began to be established in Austria
- effectively in the second half of the nineteenth century - the desire
to enjoy the trappings of a modern enlightened culture made itself felt.
The Austrians were not of course in a position to summon forth the means
to create reputable institutions and traditions of science in the narrow
sense, and this, as Ny&iacute;ri puts it, created 'a vacuum which the <i>theory</i>
of a practice so attractively pursued elsewhere could then fill' (1986,
p. 143).</font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times">Ny&iacute;ri's thesis might be held to be illustrated
particularly clearly by the case of Boltzmann, whose lack of funds for
serious experimental work seems to have constrained him to turn instead
to the (cheaper) field of theoretical physics, as also to work in philosophy.
(A variant of the thesis may be used to explain the comparative advantage
of smaller countries in certain fields not requiring vast research expenditures
- for example of Finland and Hungary in the field of mathematics.)</font>
<p><font face="Times">The Ny&iacute;ri account has its problems, however.
The liberal, scientific, enlightenment revolutions in England, France and
Holland came <i>before</i> massive urbanization, which was indeed to no
small degree a <i>product</i> of science and liberalism (having been made
possible, <i>inter alia, </i>by Pascal's invention of the omnibus). It
will not do, moreover, to provide an explanation of developments in the
intellectual or cultural sphere exclusively by appeal to underlying social
or economic factors. Explanations of this kind have been found tempting
by Marxist thinkers and by other advocates of a broadly economic approach
to human behaviour. Where, however, we are dealing with complex movements
of thought and doctrine, such explanations can be at best only partial.
For they rarely give us the needed insight into the precise intellectual
content of the movements in question. Why should the Austrians' initial
substitute for true scientific development have taken precisely these (phenomenalist
and physicalist) forms, rather than those? What is to account for the peculiar
blend of British empiricism and Russellian logic which provided the basic
framework within which, in their various ways, the members of the Schlick
circle would operate?</font>
<p><font face="Times">Clearly, and for all the dominance of schools and
movements in any particular case, we must point to the influence of specific
<i>individuals</i>
if we are to be in a position to provide satisfactory answers to questions
such as these. And there are a number of candidate individuals who come
to mind in this connection, including Boltzmann (whose vision of a unitary
science made itself felt not only among physicists but also in the wider
intellectual community in Vienna) and Wittgenstein (whose <i>Tractatus</i>
exerted a not inconsiderable influence on both Schlick and Carnap in precisely
the formative years of the Vienna Circle). We may presume, reasonably,
that no social or economic explanation of the genius of Boltzmann or Wittgenstein
(or G&ouml;del, or Einstein) would be forthcoming. Equally we may presume
that no social or economic explanation will be forthcoming of the peculiar
<i>longevity</i> of Brentano (1838-1917) and the members of his wider circle
- Marty (1847-1914), Stumpf (1848-1936), Meinong (1853-1920), H&ouml;fler
(1853-1922), Husserl (1859-1931), Ehrenfels (1859-1932), Twardowski (1866-1938)
- who did so much to spread the gospel of scientific philosophy throughout
the Empire and beyond.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">5. The Neurath Thesis</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">Even when all of this is granted, however, it would
still be insufficient to look at individuals in abstraction from the wider
social and institutional context in which they worked. This is not only
because the individual is shaped by his surrounding culture. It is also,
and more importantly, because his ideas will be able to take root in this
culture only to the extent that they strike a congenial chord in the thinking
of those to whom they are addressed.</font>
<p><font face="Times">More importantly, however, an individual, even an
individual of genius - and even an individual of genius of great longevity
- will be able to exert an influence upon his contemporaries only to the
extent that there are <i>institutions</i> which can facilitate the dissemination
of his ideas.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Hence there is a need, in regard to our specific
problem of the rise of scientific philosophy in interwar Vienna, to provide
a mixed explanation, one that makes room both for institutional and economic
and sociopolitical factors of the kind so far considered and also for the
serendipitous role of individuals. A forceful and coherent explanation
along exactly these lines has been provided by Neurath himself, in the
section labelled "Prehistory" of the Vienna circle manifesto.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Vienna, Neurath argues, provided especially fertile
soil for the development of the scientific conception of philosophy because
of the growth of liberalism in Vienna in the second half of the nineteenth
century, and of an anti-metaphysical spirit which stemmed from the enlightenment,
from empiricism, utilitarianism and the free trade movement of England.
Mach, too, was a product of this Viennese liberal enlightenment, and the
same anti-metaphysical attitudes manifested themselves in Mach's attempt
to 'purify' empirical science of metaphysical notions:</font>
<p><font face="Times">We recall his critique of absolute space which made
him a forerunner of Einstein, his struggle against the metaphysics of the
thing-in-itself and of the concept of substance, and his investigations
of the construction of the concepts of science from ultimate elements,
namely sense data. (Neurath 1929, p. 302 of translation)</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">The influence of Mach and of his successor
Boltzmann, Neurath now argues, 'makes it understandable' why there was
in Vienna 'a lively dominant interest in the epistemological and logical
problems that are linked with the foundations of physics'. Thus Hayek,
for example, reports that he and his contemporaries, upon arriving in Vienna
to take up their studies in the immediate post-war years, 'found in Mach
almost the only arguments against a metaphysical and mystificatory attitude'
such as was manifested by the dominant philosophers in the University at
the time.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">Neurath mentions further a number of Viennese social
thinkers, from both the Marxist and the non-Marxist camps, who had 'served
consciously in the spirit of the enlightenment' in the late nineteenth
century.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Thus 'in the sphere of political economy, too, a
rigorously scientific method was cultivated by the school of marginal utility'
which Carl Menger (father of Karl) had founded in 1871.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Neurath mentions in his account of the Viennese prehistory
of logical positivism also the role of Franz Brentano. As Neurath himself
puts it, the ground was cleared for the endeavours of the Vienna circle
in the direction of a reform of logic and of a concern with problems of
foundations also by Brentano:</font>
<p><font face="Times">As a Catholic priest Brentano had an understanding
for scholasticism; he started directly from the scholastic logic and from
Leibniz's endeavours to reform logic, while leaving aside Kant and the
idealist system-philosophers. Brentano and his students showed time and
again their understanding of men like Bolzano and others who were working
toward a rigorous new foundation of logic. (<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 302)</font>
<p><font face="Times">Brentano, too, was marked by the Austrian liberalism
of the nineteenth century. Thus for example he played an instrumental role
in commissioning the young Sigmund Freud to translate one of the volumes
- a collection of writings on female emancipation, socialism and Plato
- in the Gomperz edition of the works of Mill. (Freud was himself for a
time a devoted admirer of Brentano's work, though his youthful devotion
seems to have been quashed, for reasons as yet unexplained, on a trip to
Manchester during the early period of his studies in Vienna.) It is remarkable,
finally, in support of Neurath's contention as to the importance of Brentano,
to consider the degree to which the centres of scientific philosophy in
Europe - Vienna, Prague, Lemberg, Graz, Berlin, G&ouml;ttingen - were precisely
those cities in which Brentano's most distinguished students had held chairs
in philosophy from the 1890's onwards.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">6. The Neurath-Haller Thesis</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">Brentano was not only sympathetic to the idea of
a rigorously scientific method in philosophy; he also shared with the British
empiricists and with the Vienna positivists an anti-metaphysical orientation,
manifesting an especially forceful antipathy to the 'mystical paraphilosophy'
of the German idealists and stressing in all his work the unity of scientific
method. Brentano's writings involve the use of methods of language analysis
similar in some respects to those developed later by philosophers in England.
Moreover, he and his students encouraged teamwork amongst themselves as
well as an active collaboration with logicians, psychologists and the representatives
of other extra-philosophical disciplines.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Rudolf Haller, now, has developed Neurath's account
of the rise of Viennese positivism along the lines set forth above, and
transformed it into a thesis to the effect that these and certain related
features - which were shared in common not only by the Brentanists and
the logical positivists but also by thinkers as diverse as Mach and Wittgenstein
- serve to constitute a separate Austrian line of <i>regional or national
philosophy</i>. Haller's writings on the history of this 'Austrian philosophy',<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)
</a></sup>have
extended and clarified, and even institutionalized,<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)
</a></sup>the
Neurath doctrine.</font>
<p><font face="Times">But now, if this Neurath-Haller thesis can be accepted,
if, in other words, it can truly be accepted that there exists a separate
and internally coherent tradition of
<i>Austrian</i> <i>philosophy</i>,
then it follows that the Vienna Circle itself comes to be linked, via Brentano,
to Catholic scholasticism. And one could go further, and point to the <i>method</i>
of communal philosophy - of philosophizing by means of a sometimes ritualized
process of discussion and argument - as something that is shared, not merely
by Brentano and the medieval schoolmen, but also by Schlick, with his Thursday-evening
discussion-circle, and by Wittgenstein in his cell in Cambridge.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">7. Problems with the Neurath-Haller Thesis</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">Haller's own formulation of what I have called the
Neurath-Haller thesis is to be found in his paper "Wittgenstein and Austrian
Philosophy":</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">I wish … to defend two theses: first, that
in the last 100 years there has taken place an independent development
of a specifically <i>Austrian philosophy</i>, opposed to the philosophical
currents of the remainder of the German-speaking world; and secondly that
this development can sustain a genetic model which permits us to affirm
an intrinsic homogeneity of Austrian philosophy up to the Vienna Circle
and its descendants. (1981, p. 92)</font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times">The thesis, however superficially convincing,
is not without its problems. Thus, to take just one example, while it seems
that the works of Brentano, like those of Meinong and Husserl, were mentioned
in discussions of the Vienna Circle, in the case of Brentano, at least,
these writings were discussed primarily because Brentanian ethics was chosen
by Schlick as a special object of scorn.</font>
<p><font face="Times">The Neurath-Haller thesis has been attacked, too,
by Friedrich Stadler, who is reluctant to accept the running together of
the 'two camps' of Catholic reaction and progressive socialist neopositivism
(of darkness and light) which the thesis implies. Thus Stadler has pointed
out, correctly, that - in contrast to the picture of the typical Austrian
philosopher painted by Neurath and Haller - the influence of logical positivist
ideas, or of scientific philosophy in general, was in fact rather small,
at least as concerns the official life of the University of Vienna in the
period from 1918 to 1938. He has pointed out also that what predominated
in this period, both in lecture courses and in dissertation topics, was
the history of philosophy of a rather old-fashioned sort, dealing in Kant,
Schopenhauer, Spinoza, Plato, Nietzsche.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">The circle around Schlick can be seen from this perspective
to have consisted largely of philosophical cranks and dabblers, or of mathematicians,
fashioners of "ideal languages", individuals who would be taken seriously
as <i>philosophers </i>only later, and then initially only outside the
borders of Austria itself.</font>
<p><font face="Times">A somewhat different sort of criticism turns on the
fact that the suggestion that there exists a separate line of 'Austrian
philosophy' must surely constitute a sort of insult to the good citizens
of Austria. For it amounts to the thesis that philosophy in Austria is
something outside of and apart from the tradition of German-language philosophy
as a whole. The educated Austrian surely wants to believe, after all, that
the intellectual tradition of his motherland is allied with, is indeed
part and parcel of, the great tradition of Kant, Goethe, Fichte, Lessing,
Schiller - of the <i>Land der Dichter</i> <i>und Denker.</i> To ask young
Austrian philosophers to concentrate their energies on native tributaries
in the suggested fashion - the tributaries of Otto Neurath or Otto Weininger
- for reasons of national pride or loyalty - would surely imply a restriction
on their interests as radical as that which would be involved if young
literature students in Canada or Wales were forbidden to read Chaucer or
Shakespeare or Milton.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">8. Language and Style</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The attitude I have in mind, a still widespread attitude
of dismissal at the very idea of a special 'Austrian philosophy', can be
illustrated very clearly in the case of Edmund Husserl, the great German-speaking
Jewish-Austrian philosopher from Habsburg Moravia, whose newly published
correspondence reveals a thinker who conceives himself precisely as the
legitimate heir of the <i>German</i> culture of Lessing, Herder, Schiller
and Goethe, and who takes it for granted that it is the historical mission
of the German people 'to light the way for all other peoples in philosophy'.
Husserl, like his teacher Brentano, at no stage conceives his own philosophy
in light of any putative distinction between 'Austrian' and 'German' traditions,
and when he refers to 'my old Austria' he does so in purely geographical
terms. Indeed like Meinong and Frege, Husserl was from at least around
1910 a self-styled 'National-Deutscher' (though unlike Meinong and Frege
he was not an antisemite). Like almost all German academics he became caught
up in the furore of German nationalism at the start of the First World
War, and he looked forward at its close to the 'longed-for unification
of German-Austria and Germany'.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Yet as everyone can testify who is familiar with
Husserl's early logical writings or with the work of Bolzano, Brentano
oder Mach, there are radical differences of <i>style</i> and of mode of
philosophizing as between these Germanophone philosophers standardly associated
with Austria and those, such as Hegel, Heidegger, or Habermas, associated
with Germany proper.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Most simply put: the former employ a sober, scientific
style, and shun pretentions. There are also other striking and systematic
differences, for example in the degree to which the German, but not the
Austrian, line is marked by a sort of philosophical <i>hagiography.
</i>(Thus
there are Kant- and Hegel-"breviaries" which one can buy in German bookshops,
alongside similar compilations of gnomic or uplifting sayings drawn from
the writings of Goethe or Lutheror Jacob Boehme.) There are also the differences
adverted to already above - pertaining to the differential role of science
and logic as opposed to that of politics in the two traditions - differences
which serve to explain why it is (certain selected) German and not Austrian
philosophers who have been taken up into the bosom of 'Continental philosophy'
in North America. These are differences which, as we shall see, are deeply
and historically rooted, and they do much to explain why Germany - in spite
of the fact that it has brought forth such giants of mathematical logic
as Frege, Hilbert and Gentzen - has taken so long to develop a community
of analytic philosophers on its home-territory, and why not a few of those
most centrally responsible for this development - above all Wolfgang Stegm&uuml;ller
- have hailed from Austria.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times">Haller himself expresses it thus:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">as we could easily confirm at every stage,
academic geography has played an extensive role in determining the historical
dispersal of ideas. Whilst in Germany it was the influence of Husserl,
and later of Heidegger which grew, and remained dominant right up until
the '60s of this century, neither the remaining Brentano School nor the
philosophy of the Vienna Circle [has] been able to establish a foothold
in German universities; empiricism just does not seem to flourish in every
climate. (1981, p. 97)<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup></font></blockquote>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">9. The Sick Man of Europe</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">Perhaps, then, we should reformulate our initial
question as to why scientific philosophy should have taken root in (Catholic)
Austria and ask instead why such philosophy should have to such a great
extent failed to flourish in (Protestant, northern) Germany. And here again
we might turn first to Neurath, who provides an explanation of this failure
in religious terms:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">Catholics accept a compact body of dogma
and place it at the beginning of their reflections, [thus] they are sometimes
able to devote themselves to systematic logical analysis, unburdened by
any metaphysical details. … Once someone in the Catholic camp begins to
have doubts about a dogma, he can free himself with particular ease from
the whole set of dogmas and is then left a very effective logical instrument
in his possession. Not so in the Lutheran camp, where … many philosophers
and scholars from all disciplines, while avoiding a commitment to a clear
body of dogma, have retained half-metaphysical or quarter-metaphysical
turns of speech, the last remnants of a theology which has not yet been
completely superseded. … This may explain why the linguistic analysis of
unified science prevailed least in countries where the Lutheran faith had
dealt the hardest blows to the Catholic church, despite the fact that technology
and the sciences that go along with it are highly developed in these countries.
(Neurath 1933, p. 277 of translation)</font></blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Times">Hence, Neurath claims (somewhat over-optimistically),
the 'revolt against the metaphysical tradition is succeeding outside Lutheran
countries in Calvinistic as well as in Catholic ones' and he notes with
pride that there are in Austria 'no such metaphysical autocrats as Heidegger,
Rickert or others' (<i>loc. cit.</i>).</font>
<p><font face="Times">Unfortunately for Neurath, however, Heidegger himself
was steeped rather in Catholic than in Lutheran metaphysics as a young
man; and as we have already noted, there are many Catholic countries in
other respects comparable to Austria where logical empiricism and analytic
philosophy have failed to take substantial root, just as there are Lutheran
countries (Finland is here the most striking example), and of course countries
of Anglican-Episcopalian filiation - not mentioned at all by Neurath -
which have served as the veritable bastions of the analytic tradition.</font>
<p><font face="Times">One must clearly look elsewhere; and from this perspective
it seems that features not of religion but of the political history of
the Germans (as contrasted to that of the English or the Austrians) are
of particular relevance. For philosophy has come to play a role in the
political consciousness of the German state in a way that it has not in
that of England or Austria. Just as England has its National Theatre, we
might say, so Germany has its own National Philosophy: Kant, Fichte and
Hegel, like Goethe and Schiller, are national monuments of the German people,
whose memory is held sacred not least because they are seen, retrospectively,
as having been involved in creating that unified national consciousness
which made possible Germany itself as a unified nation state. Philosophers
and philosophical master-texts have thus acquired a role in the history
of Germany that is analogous to the role of Homer in the history of Greece
or of Shakespeare and the Magna Carta in the History of the English.</font>
<p><font face="Times">The characteristic property of such master texts,
now, be they master texts of a religion, a sect, a people or a culture,
is their tendency to spawn a commentary literature, with all that this
implies by way of association with the commentary literatures on, for example,
Aristotle, the Bible, or the writings of Marx and Engels.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">It cannot be emphasized too often that German philosophers
have for at least a century been schooled systematically in the habits
of a philosophical culture in which the most important textual models have
that sort of status, and that sort of density and obscurity, which is associated
with the need for commentaries. They grow up further in a philosophical
culture which is sealed off by firm disciplinary boundaries from the empirical
sciences and which places a high value not on consistency and clarity but
rather on 'depth' and 'authenticity'. The work of the philosopher - as
of the poet - is after all an expression of the national spirit (as Herder,
long before Heidegger, and in much the same tone, insisted); hence also
it should not be seen as subject to revision, or to second, more carefully
considered thoughts on the part of its author, nor (<i>a fortiorissimo</i>)
to criticism on the part of others; rather it should be conveyed to the
reader as far as possible in the 'authentic' form in which it was first
put down, as a direct expression of the author's soul or 'spirit'. Consider,
in this context, the mind-deadeningly repetitive stream-of-consciousness
rantings of Derrida, who shows how, in this as in so much else, French
philosophy (or more precisely: that part of French philosophy that is dubbed
'Continental'), has become little more than a parody of its German model.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Teamwork and the exercise of mutual criticism and
persistent argument, and indeed the search for any sort of 'truth' in philosophy,
are in French and German C.P.-philosophy simply out of place.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times">In the wider world, however, it is not classical
German idealism, with its political and historical associations, but rather
empirical, or at least scientifically oriented, philosophy that has for
a long time come to constitute the contemporary mainstream. The latter
is, for reasons not altogether accidental, a philosophy which values logic,
argument and technical competence more highly than those literary, ideological
and historical qualities which are at a premium in certain philosophical
circles in Germany and France. Moreover it seems likely to be the case
that (whether for good or ill), as the discipline of philosophy becomes
ever more a creature of the modern university, it will come to be marked
to increasing degrees by the factor of professionalization, so that respect
for technical competence and for the scientific method, and the rejection
of hagiography and the use of a mystificatory style, will come increasingly
to characterize the discipline of philosophy as a whole. <sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times">The most prominent Austrian philosophers have accordingly,
as we might put it, been speaking prose all along without knowing it. Or
to put the point another way: Haller's institutional account of the rise
of regional or national philosophies in Europe ought most properly to be
seen as applying not to Austria at all, but rather to Germany (and France),
where the political and literary associations of philosophy have had, from
the perspective of the disciplinary mainstream, serious negative consequences
in holding back the development of philosophy in ways which have become
ever more striking in recent decades.</font>
<p><font face="Times">If, now, we return to our question as to how we are
to explain the rise of scientific philosophy in <i>Austria</i>, then we
can see that this question in fact needs no answer. In Austria, exactly
as in Poland and Scandinavia, and exactly as in England and the rest of
the Anglosaxophone world, the rise of scientific philosophy is an inevitable
concomitant of the simple process of modernization.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">'Austrian philosophy', for all its usefulness in
combining together in a single unity the philosophies of Vienna, Graz and
Lemberg, of Bolzanians, Machians and Brentanists, is thus a misnomer to
the degree that it suggests, erroneously, that there is a corresponding
sectarian or regional or ethnic philosophy. For Austrian philosophy is
philosophy <i>per se, </i>part and parcel of the mainstream of world philosophy:
it is that part of German-language philosophy which meets international
standards of rigour, professionalism and specialization.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">In this respect, to repeat the point, it is Germany,
not Austria, which is the special case, Germany which is<i> the philosophical
sick man of Europe.</i></font>
<p><font face="Times">Austrian philosophy after the Second World War could
of course have very easily gone either way. It could have become, like
German, or Bulgarian, philosophy, a backwater, shipwrecked on the reef
of history (and such was indeed for a time the fate of philosophy in Vienna).
That it did not in this fashion get stranded on the paraphilosophical fringe;
that it did not go the zany way of French (Parisian) philosophy and become
reduced to the level of a mere sect, is due primarily to one individual
- an individual, as we all hope, of great longevity - it is due to Rudolf
Haller. In this respect it may be said that one signal contribution of
Rudolf Haller to the philosophy of the twentieth century has been to ensure
that there is no such thing as 'Austrian philosophy'.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">10. The Law of Conservation of Spread</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">In analogy with the physicist's law of conservation
of matter (and with Robert Musil's law of the conservation of happiness),
one might venture to formulate also a law of conservation of the various
branches of intellectual concern which have traditionally, in the West,
been grouped together under the heading 'philosophy'. If one or other of
these branches is in one way or another suppressed, or so we might hazard,
then it will somehow find a way to force itself through in some new, unexpected
territory, or in some other, perhaps bastardized, form. (To paraphrase
Bacon on matter and its protean nature: should we drive it to extremities
with the purpose of reducing it to nothing, then it will, finding itself
in these straits, turn and transform itself into strange shapes, passing
from one change to another till it has gone through the whole circle.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>)
If Marxist philosophy, broadly conceived, is no longer able to be taken
seriously in the fields of economics or political theory, then it will
rise again in the field of, say, comparative literature (T. Eagleton <i>et
al.</i>) or of linguistic pragmatism (J. Habermas, K.-O. Apel). Something
like this, I suggest, has been the fate of many of the classical philosophical
concerns now customarily dealt with by those pleased to call themselves
'Continental philosophers', many of whom are of course assembled not in
philosophy departments but in womens studies and 'humanities' centres,
in departments of film studies, and so forth.</font>
<p><font face="Times">But now, one reason for the explosive growth of C.P.-philosophy
in these extra-philosophical environs in recent decades lies in the fact
that the philosophers proper have too often ignored the corresponding issues
and areas of concern, having devoted their primary energies rather to logic
and to other, more technical branches of our discipline. Other fields of
traditional philosophical concern have in this way been left clear for
fools, knaves, and others, who have rushed in to fill the vacuum thereby
created. Part of the blame for the excesses of the latter is, accordingly,
to be laid squarely at the door of Carnap and Ryle.</font>
<p><font face="Times">How, now, should those - the contemporary heirs of
Schlick and Masaryk, be they in Providence or Canberra, in Helsinki or
Graz - who believe in truth in philosophy, react to these developments?
Should they simply ignore 'Continental philosophy' and the text- and commentary-based
traditions of philosophizing in Germany and France from out of which it
grew, in the hope that they will simply go away? Should they, as is now
all too customary, allow the inhabitants of the C.P.-ghetto of Heideggerians,
Derridians and Irigarians to perform their antics undisturbed, whether
in the spirit of pluralistic tolerance or in that of scornful disdain?
To react in this fashion would, I believe, be a great mistake. This is
not, be it noted, because I believe that the proper reaction to the cynicisms,
relativisms and irrationalisms which predominate in so many corners of
our 'postmodern' world would be to form a new 'movement' charged with agitation
on behalf of the scientific world-conception along the lines promulgated
by the 'linker Fl&uuml;gel' of the Vienna Circle. For as Schlick, however
dimly, saw, the formation of a movement of 'scientific philosophy' - to
be ranked alongside 'women's philosophy', 'Australian regional philosophy',
and the like - can only contribute to the widespread confusion of supposing
that there are <i>different sorts of truth</i>: scientific truth, women's
truth, aboriginal truth, Kiwi truth, and so on.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Rather, we should orient ourselves more steadfastly
around the idea that it is the proper business of philosophy to search
for truth simpliciter, including truth in the various fields of the history
of philosophy. This, surely, must imply also a search for truth even in
relation to those byways of philosophical history and of philosophical
concern which do not fit well into the customary and rather narrow picture
of philosophical history that has been favoured by analytic philosophers
hitherto. It must imply, indeed, a search for truth in the history of German
and even of French philosophy in all its breadth. Here, too, something
like rigour and technical competence is possible, as the best scholars
in the fields of the history of philosophy and of textual scholarship have
demonstrated.</font>
<p><font face="Times">It would be one incidental benefit of the study of
the history of philosophy along these lines that it would help to make
clear to philosophers and others that in former times, too, which is to
say in previous dark ages of philosophical development, generations of
philosophers have repeatedly been wont to declare themselves as constituting
the 'end' of philosophy as we know it and have engaged in competition with
their predecessors in the wildness of the antics with which they set out
to support such claims.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">On the other hand, however, it will become clear
also to the student of this catholic history of philosophy that such dark
periods in philosophical history were in each case succeeded by new and
healthier phases, in which truth and reason were once more, and with renewed
vigour, given their due.</font>

<p><a NAME="N_1_"></a><font face="Times">1. Consider the following characteristically
pretentious passage, chosen at random from Derrida's <i>Spurs, </i>in which
Derrida seems to be arguing that the concepts of <i>truth</i> and <i>castration</i>,
hitherto commonly held to be distinct, are in fact identical:</font>
<p><font face="Times">The feminine distance abstracts truth from itself
in a <i>suspension</i> of the relation with castration. This relation is
suspended much as one might tauten or stretch a canvas, or a relation,
which nevertheless remains - suspended - in indecision. In the <i>epoch&eacute;.
</i>It
is with castration that this relation is suspended, not with the truth
of castration - in which the woman does [not*] believe anyway - and not
with the truth inasmuch as it might be castration. Nor is it the relation
with truth-castration that is suspended, for that is precisely a man's
affair. That is the masculine <i>concern, </i>the <i>concern</i> of the
male who has never come of age, who is never sufficiently sceptical or
dissimulating. In such an affair the male, in his credulousness and naivety
(which is always sexual, always pretending even at times to masterful expertise),
castrates himself and from the secretion of his act fashions the snare
of truth-castration. (Perhaps at this point one ought to interrogate -
and "unboss" - the metaphorical fullblown sail of truth's declamation,
of the castration and phallocentrism, for example in Lacan's discourse).
