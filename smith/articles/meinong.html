<P><BR>What follows is an exercise in hunter-gatherer ontology. More precisely,
the region of <I>space </I>and of <I>spatial objects</I> will be adopted
as a happy hunting ground for the purposes of Meinongian metaphysics. Meinong,
notoriously, struggled against the prejudice in favour of the actual and
fought on behalf of the ontological rights of incomplete, impossible, and
indeterminate objects. A parallel struggle, as we shall see, can be waged
in the domain of spatial objects. Meinong's ideas can in this way be seen
to have relevance for studies of the philosophical foundations of the theories
of land-surveying and of international law.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>1. Heaven</B>
<P>Heaven, for our purposes, is simply empty space; it is the three-dimensional
counterpart of the territory that is represented by the Bellman's blank
Ocean Chart in Lewis Carroll's <I>Hunting of the Snark</I>:

<BLOCKQUOTE><U>Figure One: Bellman's Blank Ocean Chart</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;
<P>Candidate denizens of empty space are the parts of this space. These
include: three-dimensional spatial volumes, two-dimensional surfaces, one-dimensional
lines, zero-dimensional points. (We shall ignore such further options as
would arise in case a temporal dimension in the realm of heavenly objects
were taken into account, or in case heaven were allowed more generally
to contain topoids of larger numbers of dimensions. We shall ignore also
the issue of deviant geometries, space-filling curves, Klein-bottle- and
Sierpinski-Menger-sponge-shaped regions, and the like.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>)
We shall concentrate our attentions further on finite portions of space,
though we acknowledge that, if the empty universe is itself infinite, then
it would seem that infinite spatial volumes, too, for example the western
hemisphere of the universe, would have strong claims to be countenanced
as existing within it.
<P>Suppose, now, that empty space as here defined exists. Do all abstractly
(geometrically) conceivable finite portions of this space exist also? Imagine,
for example, that portion of space which consists of two disjoint and non-connected
spheres. Does this double sphere exist in the same sense (have the same
ontological rights) as its separate spherical parts? Or imagine a perforated
spatial region that has the form of a sphere of two-unit radius, in the
interior of which is a one-unit radius spherical hole. Does this perforated
sphere exist in the same sense as does the corresponding solid sphere of
two-unit radius?
<P>Or imagine some single spherical volume of unit radius. Imagine further
that this spatial volume is topologically closed (or in other words: includes
as proper part its outer boundary or skin). Does this skin itself exist
with the same rights as does the closed spherical volume with which we
began? And what of the corresponding <I>open</I> spherical volume (the
residue which remains when the skin is conceived, abstractly, as having
been removed from the sphere as a whole)? Does this open sphere exist as
an object additional to its closed counterpart? And what of the infinitely
many <I>partially open and partially closed</I> unit spheres, the results
of subtracting different fragments of this skin from the original spatial
volume - all of which, we would do well to bear in mind, occupy the very
same spatial region as does the closed sphere with which we started? Consider
moreover the fact that, if the unit sphere exists as a closed spatial region,
then its complement - that object which results when we abstractly conceive
the sphere in question as having been removed from the universe - is itself
open. Do complements exist with the same civil rights as do the objects
which they are the complements of?
<P>In heaven, as we see, there are many questions.
<P>Some, more brutally minded ontologists (the practitioners of ontological
<I>force
majeure</I>), might want to resolve these questions by conceiving heaven
set-theoretically, so that the only heavenly entities which existed with
full civil rights would turn out to be extensionless spatial points. In
addition to these one would then recognize, as entities existing in some
second sense, all sets of points, all sets of sets of points, etc. This
set-theoretic account and the system of coordinate geometry which goes
along with it have familiar advantages. But it also brings problems, connected
not least with the failures of the set-theoretical project associated with
Cantor's continuum hypothesis. A further family of problems arises when
we consider how, precisely, the set-theoretic treatment of space is to
be understood. If, on the one hand, it is treated as a mere <I>model</I>
of space, then it leaves open the very questions pertaining to the ontology
of space which are here at issue. If, on the other hand, it is treated
not as a mere model but as an exercise in serious ontology - if, in other
words, it is accepted that spatial regions are sets - then it would follow
that spatial regions are abstract objects. But how, then, could they be
such that concrete things are able to <I>occupy</I> them?
<P>The set-theoretic account dictates finally a controversial metaphysical
thesis to the effect that space is built up out of points. In the absence
of secure intuitions as to the truth or falsehood of this thesis we should
seek instead a more neutral theory - such as mereology - which is consistent
with both the postulate of atomism and its negation.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)
</A></SUP>Mereology proceeds as it were from the top down, taking as its
starting point extended spatial continua. An extreme version of the mereological
top-down approach is generated by what might be called Aristotelian mereological
potentialism, a view to the effect that the part of a whole can never be
an actual thing if the whole is.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3) </A></SUP>My arm,
as part of me, is real or actual on this view, but it is not a real or
actual <I>thing;</I> rather, it is merely a<I> potential</I> thing: it
would become an actual thing only through physical separation. Similarly
a collective of bodily wholes, say of separate coral reefs, would become
an actual thing only if the bodies in question were fused together to form
a unitary object. These constituent bodies would then themselves thereby
cease to be actual things. (My arm as part of me is, we might say, sub-unitary;
the collection of non-connected coral reefs is super-unitary.) Since heaven
is, by assumption, everywhere homogeneous, there is on the potentialist
view only one candidate heavenly object (only one place), namely the universe
as a whole. Each putative constituent place exists only potentially (i.e.
it <I>would</I> exist if, counterfactually, heaven were reduced in size
in corresponding fashion).
<P>Mereological potentialism thus avoids the embarrassments of an ontologically
over-generous ontology; it recognizes only one (actual) object. It appeals
to those of our intuitions which suggest that our answers to the considered
questions can be a matter of convention only, so that such questions might
surely be ignored for any purposes of an ulimate ontological assay. These
advantages of the potentialist view are spurious, however; for the very
same questions raised above reappear in modified form in the potentialist
framework: do all those candidate denizens (open and closed regions, solid
and perforated regions, and all the possible sums, differences and complements
thereof) exist <I>potentially</I> in the same sense and in such a way as
to enjoy equal ontological rights? In what follows, therefore, we shall
defend the (Brentanian) doctrine of mereological actualism, a doctrine
to the effect that parts exist with the same ontological standing as do
their respective wholes. If you have a single spherical region, then you
thereby also already have infinitely many pairs of hemispherical regions,
infinitely many quadruples of quarter-spherical regions, and so on <I>ad
indefinitum</I>.
<P>The doctrine of mereological actualism asserts that the parts of things
are as actual as the things themselves. With Brentano (1981), we shall
extend mereological actualism to boundaries also, both external (the outer
surface of the closed spherical region as a whole), and internal (interior
surfaces, interior lines, interior points, and so on). We shall however
deny the presupposition that is at the heart of set theory to the effect
that boundaries - for example isolated points - can exist independently
of the entities of higher dimension which they are the boundaries of. Boundaries
are actual things, but they are dependent entities; they can exist only
in tandem with the larger things or regions which are their hosts. Already
Abelard had remarked that 'A line … is unable to exist apart from some
bodily subject,' and as Chisholm points out, 'Brentano makes the same point
with respect to every type of boundary.' (1992/93) In Smith (1993) I refer
to the principle that boundaries cannot exist except in consort with the
higher-dimensional entities which they are the boundaries of as 'Brentano's
thesis'.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>2. Earth</B>
<P>I have not the foggiest notion as to how to go about answering the various
questions raised and left open in the foregoing. One thing, however, seems
clear: the empty space empty space that is described above is from the
ontological (as from every other) point of view thoroughly homogeneous.
What holds in one corner of heaven holds identically also in every other
corner.
<P>Where space is not empty, however, matters are entirely different. Here
a range of different sorts of spatial object can be distinguished, in addition
to that stock of homogeneous spatial objects (the stock of <I>places</I>)
which exists purely in virtue of the underlying geometry of space. Following
the terminology advanced in Smith 1994 we can distinguish above all between:
<P>1. <I>Bona fide<B> </B></I>spatial objects (for example planets, moons,
islands, lakes) which exist in virtue of intrinsic physical discontinuities
in the material constitution of the earth.
<P>2. <I>Fiat </I>spatial objects (for example states, counties, land-parcels)
of a sort which reflect no intrinsic physical discontinuities but are rather
the product of boundaries drawn on the basis of human fiat or convention
or are otherwise the artefacts of human geographical practices.
<P>Earth, unlike heaven, contains <I>conventional</I> parts. Fiat spatial
objects, in contrast to the purely geometrical denizens of heaven and in
contrast to the <I>bona fide</I> ('natural') spatial objects here on earth,
seem to be <I>human creations: </I>they are entities which come to be superadded
to the world in consequence of human cognitive acts and practices.
<P>The opposition between what is <I>found </I>or <I>discovered</I> and
what is <I>made</I> or <I>created</I> is of course nothing new in the history
of metaphysics. For present purposes we might distinguish, in the range
of possible ontologies, between:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Extreme idealism</I>: the doctrine that <I>all</I> objects
are created, or in other words that all objects exist exclusively as the
products or figments of human cognition.<I></I>
<P><I>Moderate</I> (or 'creationist' or 'Ingardenian'<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP>)
<I>realism</I>: the doctrine that <I>some</I> objects are created, some
discovered.<I></I>
<P><I>Extreme</I> (or 'platonist' or 'Meinongian') <I>realism</I>: the
doctrine that <I>all</I> objects are discovered, or more particular that
all objects are found and not made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I shall dismiss immediately the extreme idealist alternative (or is there
really some extreme idealist who believes sincerely that the ground on
which he stands, or the meteor speeding towards the building in which he
sits, is a mere product of human cognition?). The important debate, I would
argue, is that between extreme and moderate realism. Consider, in this
light, the case of Wyoming which, like many political and administrative
spatial objects in the United States, has a shape roughly as follows:<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC="meindiag.gif" HSPACE=70 HEIGHT=182 WIDTH=256 ALIGN=CENTER>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><U>Figure Two: Wyoming</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;
<P>From the Meinongian, extreme realist perspective, which we might also
call 'geometrical Platonism' or 'geometrical objectivism', Wyoming existed
long before man first set foot on the American continent, but so also did
infinitely many alternative Wyomings (Wyoming displaced 1 inch to the east,
Wyoming displaced 1 furlong to the west, Wyoming minus Crook County, and
so on). Wyoming is thus to be conceived along the lines of the heavenly
objects discussed above. Wyoming as it is at present (<I>anno</I> 1995)
geometrically constituted will on this view continue to exist even if Wyoming
and one or more of its neighbours should agree to some exchange of territory
(though our present geometrical Wyoming would then no longer be called
'Wyoming' and would likely not have any name at all). Surprisingly, this
Meinongian view can claim the advantages of ontological economy - at least
for those who have already embraced a suitably rich ontology of spatial
objects distributed purely geometrically across the surface of the earth.
For it conceives political and administrative spatial objects of the sort
which might otherwise be seen as being <I>created</I> by acts of human
fiat as mere logical constructions out of geometrical objects, and it is
exclusively the latter which are granted full ontological rights. The Meinongian
account can even do justice to changes in geopolitical and administrative
borders: entities like Bosnia, or Poland, or the Netherlands would turn
out from this perspective to be <I>entia successiva,</I> whose successive
real parts are corresponding purely geometrical bits of space. (I am here
clearly leaving out of account issues pertaining to the fact that the earth
itself is such as to occupy distinct portions of space at different times.)
<P>The competing, Ingardenian view, on the other hand, can claim the advantages
of naturalness. This view asserts that, in the year 1890, a new spatial
object called 'Wyoming' came into being as a result of human fiat and that
this object has since enjoyed a certain history of its own; thus in the
intervening period Wyoming might have changed its size or shape or location
in relation to other spatial objects on the surface of the earth. Political
and administrative entities are comparable in this respect to organisms
- they may grow and develop, and even move about from place to place, yet
always in such a way as to preserve their identity. (Unlike organisms they
may even, as occurred in the case of Poland and Austria, enjoy a period
of non-existence after which their identity is once again recovered: perhaps
we might refer in such cases, in Meinongian spirit, to the 'implexive existence
of the pure spatial object'.) Land-parcels, political and administrative
entities may also fuse and split, in such a way that new entities are produced
out of parts existing earlier.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6) </A></SUP>Certainly
Wyoming in this historical sense is at any given moment coincident with
some region of space of the purely geometrical sort; but as we shall argue
below it is never identical with any such region of space.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>3. Performative Maps</B>
<P>The Ingardenian ontology of historically existing political-administrative
spatial objects is an extension of the theory of multi-dimensional continua
elaborated by Brentano in the papers collected together as <I>Philosophical
Investigations on Space, Time and the Continuum</I> (1988). Brentano there
sketches a conception of the realm of spatial objects as a lasagna-like,
many-layered edifice, with realms of heterogeneous ('secondary') spatial
objects built up on the basis of a homogeneous 'primary' spatial continuum
on the lowest level. But the theory can also be seen as an extension of
the theory of performatives worked out by Adolf Reinach in his <I>A Priori
Foundations of the Civil Law </I>in 1913 (a theory subsequently rediscovered,
though with none of Reinach's ontological sophistication, by Anglosaxophone
speech act theorists in the 1950s).
<P>We distinguish first of all between two classes of speech acts, giving
rise to two sorts of products or consequences, which we shall call <I>abstract</I>
and <I>concrete, </I>respectively. Commandings, thankings, forgivings,
warnings and threatenings are performative uses of language which yield
<I>concrete</I>
consequences - above all actions, attitudes and feelings on the part of
real people, entities which are fully a part of the real, historical, world
of causal change. Promisings, legislatings, contractings, plightings, baptisings,
ennoblings on the other hand, are performative uses of language which give
rise to <I>abstract</I> consequences, to entities
<I>sui generis </I>which
are not (or not directly) subject to causal influences. Examples of such
abstract consequences are: claims, obligations, laws, rights (including
property-rights), troths, knighthoods, names, etc.<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP>
<P>Having drawn this distinction in the realm of linguistic acts, we can
now point to the existence of a parallel distinction in the realm of what
we might call <I>performative uses of maps</I>. That is, we can distinguish
between
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. concrete consequences of uses of maps, for example actions
(above all actions of way-finding, acts of war, etc.) and feelings (of
being threatened, overawed, offended, etc.: see Monmoyer 1991, ch. 7);
<P>2. abstract consequences of uses of maps, for example the creation of
state-, county- and property-boundaries, as also of such entities as the
International Date Line, the Mason-Dixon line, and so on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Abstract consequences are distinguished by the fact that they are entities
of such a sort that they can exist <I>only</I> as the fruits or products
of corresponding performative acts. They are distinguished further by the
fact that, like claims, obligations and other legal entities, they fall
midway between Platonic objects, which lie outside the realm of time and
change, and real objects of the causal flux. (See Twardowski 1979.) In
this respect they are comparable to the natural kinds of biology as also
to linguistic kinds (such as <I>adverb</I> or <I>phoneme) </I>and to the
other entities treated of by Husserl (1973) under the heading 'bound ideality'.
<P>The feature of dependence upon specific acts of human fiat seems to
be characteristic of political and administrative spatial objects in general,
though some manifest this feature to a higher degree than others. Thus
there are maximally conventional objects of this sort whose boundaries
are exact geometrical figures, normally straight lines (though part of
the Delaware-Pennsylvania border is an arc of a circle). Straight borders
are associated especially with colonialism: they are borders drawn by governments
in (Washington, Ottawa, London, or Mexico) before they know how things
look on the ground. Such borders can be quite stable and peaceful (this
applies also to the colonially drawn borders in the sub-Sahara region),
in contrast to the carefully drawn boundaries of Europe based on the idea
of a "self-determination of nations", or to the boundaries insisted upon
by Irish nationalists, for whom 'Ireland cannot shift her frontiers. The
Almighty traced them beyond the cunning of man to modify.' (Bowman 1982,
p. 11)
<P>God made Ireland, we might say, but all the rest is the work of man.
<P>Even those island nations which seem to be blessed with maximally natural
borders are abstract consequences in our sense, however, which is to say
that they are products of human convention or fiat. This is because their
apparent naturalness disappears when we take into account the status of
all nations as historical products. Certainly any given political or administrative
entity may at any given time be loosely identified with some given portion
of land (either a two-dimensional surface or a three-dimensional slab of
a certain thickness). That this identification is at best loose, however,
i.e. that we do not have before us here a case of <I>identity, </I>is shown
by the fact that the surface or slab in question typically existed long
before the corresponding political or administrative entity came into being.
The political or administrative entity is marked further by the fact that
it may change in shape or location, may in other words become similarly
loosely identified with a different slab or surface in the course of time,
yet in such a way as to remain itself one and identical.
<P>At least in many of the cases standardly put forward as natural political
unities the appearance of naturalness is diminished still further in view
of the fact that we are dealing not with some one single land-mass, but
rather with more complex products of human demarcation. Ireland, even the
unitary Ireland conceived in the minds of Irish Republicans, is still in
Meinong's terminology an 'object of higher order': it is a super-unitary
entity built up on the basis of constituent parts such as Inishkea, Inishmore,
Gorumna Island, and so on. Other even more conspicuous examples of higher
order geographical objects are: the Holy Roman Empire, the European Union,
the United States of America and so on. Each of the latter is a super-unitary
spatial whole made up of smaller and relatively more unitary parts. On
the other side we can distinguish sub-unitary spatial objects: spatial
<I>parts</I>
which can be distinguished within larger (and more or less 'natural') unitary
wholes: the non-coastal states and nations of South America and of continental
Europe are sub-unitary in this sense (and Catalonia and Cornwall might
be regarded as sub-sub-unitary spatial objects along the same lines).<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP>
<P>Denmark, the Helvetian Confederation, the Commonwealth of Independent
States are examples of spatial objects which manifest both super- and sub-unitary
features, which is to say they are at one and the same time the products
of unification of scattered parts some or all of which are at the same
time the products of carving out of smaller parts within a larger spatial
whole.
<P>That sub-unitary spatial objects such as Catalonia or the Czech Republic
are fiat or created objects is shown further by the fact that, even where
the exterior boundaries of such objects coincide in large degree with rivers
or other natural topographical features, these boundaries are still not
<I>identical
</I>with the given features; rather, the boundaries in question will standardly
be identified with some non-natural surrogate. The boundary will run, for
example, along the middle of a river. All legal and political boundaries
must, it seems, be infinitely thin; they must take up no space, since otherwise
disputes would constantly arise in relation to the no-mans-land which the
boundaries themselves would then occupy. This 'middle' will in the first
place be geometrically defined; should the river change its course, however,
then it may have to be determined by negotiation or by some other non-trivial
means where its 'middle' now lies.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP>
<P>A final reason for conceiving political and administrative boundaries
as created entities (rather then as entities picked out or discovered within
the pre-existing totality of all relevant geometrically determined possibilities)
turns on the fact that there are political and administrative boundaries
which coincide (occupy an identical spatial location) throughout their
total length. The name 'Vienna' refers on the one hand to a certain Austrian
city, on the other hand it refers to one of the constituent states (<I>Bundesl&auml;nder)
</I>of
the Austrian Republic. As it happens the boundaries of the city and of
the state of Vienna coincide exactly, and both serve as boundaries in the
same direction. But they are for all that not identical, as is seen in
the fact that the two might in principle diverge (as is currently true,
for example, in relation to the otherwise analogous case of the city and
state of Salzburg).
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>4. Conclusion: Impossible and Incomplete Spatial Objects</B>
<P>We shall conclude, briefly, with a discussion of a spatial analogue
of what Meinong referred to as 'impossible' and 'incomplete objects'. Nothing
can be red and green all over. And so, also, we might conclude, with our
eyes on a map of troop-movements on the Indo-Chinese border, nothing can
be both Indian and Chinese all over. The fundamental principles of international
law seem after all to dictate, for each given state, exclusive jurisdiction
over its national territory and the permanent population living there together
with a duty of non-intervention in the area of exclusive jurisdiction of
all other states. A moment's reflection reveals, however, that parts of
the earth's surface can indeed be both Indian and Chinese (or British and
Argentine) all over: something like this applies even under present political
conditions to international waters and to Antarctica, and outcomes of this
sort were earlier the standard product of one favoured method for resolving
border-disputes &agrave; la Austria-Hungary, namely through interdynastic
marriage and fusion of territories.
<P>As to incomplete spatial objects, which is to say spatial objects lacking
crisp exterior boundaries, here a range of examples present themselves,
beginning with spatial objects depicted on weather maps ('an area of high
pressure over the Atlantic') and ending with territorial regions ('the
Khanate of the Golden Horde (<I>circa
</I>1350)', 'the Seljuk Kingdom of
Iconium (<I>circa </I>1140)') on the fringes of areas of settled political
power. Objects of these sorts might be said to constitute a third category
of spatial object, in addition to the fiat and bona fide spatial objects
distinguished above. They are found most conspicuously in the extra-human
world (of deserts, clouds, gulf-streams, of flocks of birds and shoals
of fish), but they are to be found depicted also in language- and dialect-atlases,
as also in maps of religious observance and political behavior. Objects
of this sort are clearly not the fiat products of some deliberate drawing
of conventional borders, but nor are they the products of any tracking
of underlying autonomous contours in nature. As they are depicted on maps
we might think of them rather as the products of sampling (of temperature,
air-pressure, rainfall, etc.), to the results of which certain standard
algorithms are applied to generate bounded regions, regions which will
however often overlap (and which may be represented, pictorially, by means
of cross-hatching). Historical reflection will tell us, now, that objects
of this third sort must in fact precede the tidily demarcated fiat spatial
objects (nations, states, empires) with which we have grown familiar in
the course of time. As the historian Owen Lattimore expresses it (1962,
p. 471):
<BLOCKQUOTE>Frontiers are of social, not geographic origin. Only after
the concept of a frontier exists can it be attached by the community that
has conceived it to a geographical configuration. The consciousness of
belonging to a group, a group that includes certain people and excludes
others, must precede the conscious claim for that group of the right to
live or move about within a particular territory.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The metaphysical treatment of boundaries and frontiers is still, unfortunately,
in its early stages. One of its tasks will be to do justice to these 'frontiers
of social origin' and to the processes by which, not singly but in more
or less harmonious consort, they become attached to specific regions of
space.

<P><A NAME="N_1_"></A>1. Our aim is to depart not too far from space as
given intuitively, while at the same time leaving open the possibility
of applying our reflections to space as described by the mathematician.
<P><A NAME="N_2_"></A>2. See Simons 1987.
<P><A NAME="N_3_"></A>3. On this terminology see Smith 1987.
<P><A NAME="N_4_"></A>4. See Smith 1980.
<P><A NAME="N_5_"></A>5. These lines are not straight: they are parallels
of latitude and longitude.
<P><A NAME="N_6_"></A>6. They are comparable, in this respect to holes
and other superficial entities of the sort described in Casati and Varzi
1994.
<P><A NAME="N_7_"></A>7. Certainly such abstract consequences may give
rise in their turn to concrete consequences. The terms 'abstract' and 'concrete'
may from this point of view be misleading.
<P><A NAME="N_8_"></A>8. A unitary spatial whole is analogous, if one will,
to a single organism; the super-unitary whole to a family of organisms;
the sub-unitary whole to undetached limbs or organs within a single organism.
For more on these distinctions and their applications to geography see
Smith 1995.
