<p><b>ROUGH DRAFT PREPARED FOR</b>
<br><b>THE CONSCIOUS MIND</b>
<br><b>CONFERENCE IN BUFFALO</b>
<br><b>NOVEMBER 5-6, 1999</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Introduction</b></span>
<br><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the mind-body axis
which occupies many of the papers in this conference. Here, in contrast,
and less Chalmingly, I shall concentrate on the orthogonal link between
mind or consciousness on the one hand, and its external environment on
the other. The two axes are of course related. There is indeed an analogue
of the mind-body problem (which concerns the relationship between our folk-psychological
ontology on the one hand and the physical ontology of the body) on the
side of the environment of mind. We might call it the mesoscopic-macroscopic
environment problem, and it concerns the relationship between our folk-physical
ontology of the medium-sized objects which surround us and the physical
ontology of the underlying microstuffs. More briefly: it is the problem
of understanding how common-sense realism and physical realism can be seen
to be compatible. My strategy in what follows will be, via a long detour
through Gestalt psychology and ecological psychology, to show what sort
of conception of world and environment is needed in order to make sense
of this compatibility.&nbsp;</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Truthmakers</b></span>
<br><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Consider the following judgment-pair,
which we are to understand as referring to one and the same event of tea-drinking
in Paris one summer's afternoon:</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) 'Estelle is taking tea
with Chantal'</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) 'Trotsky's great granddaughter
is taking tea with Merleau-Ponty's niece'</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The family of truthmakers
for (B) is, intuitively, larger than the family of truthmakers for (A).<sup><a href="#N_2_">
(2)</a></sup> This is because Trotsky and Merleau-Ponty are involved in
making (B) true in a way in which they are not involved in making (A) true.
(B), we might say, demarcates, or captures within its representational
scope, a larger portion of reality than does (A). The family of truthmakers
for (B) extends back in time to comprehend objects which do not exist in
the present.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Something similar holds now,
in relation to:</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) 'Nicola is undergoing
a C*-neuron firing'</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(D) 'Nicola is watching Prunella'</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here again, I want to argue,
the family of truthmakers for (D) is larger than the family of truthmakers
for (C). This is so, even if the event inside Nicola's head referred to
in (C) is identical to the event of watching Prunella referred to in (D).<sup><a href="#N_3_">
(3)</a></sup> The families of truthmakers for these two judgments are different
in virtue of the different representational scopes of the two judgments,
which trawl through reality in different ways.
<br></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>The Environment of Mind</b></span>
<br><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I want to make sense of
this difference is in terms of different <i>environments</i>: the environment
that is picked out by (C) is a certain cortical region inside Nicola's
head; the environment picked out by (D) is a certain surrounding region
of external reality in which Prunella, too, is included. Students of the
mind-body problem from Descartes to Fodor have, notoriously, almost always
conceived the subject of mental experience in isolation from such surrounding
environments. One exception to this rule is the Gestalt psychologists (above
all Kurt Koffka and Kurt Lewin), who sought to understand the relations
between acts and objects as parts or moments of a larger relation of engagement
between subjects and objects in a common physical world. They embraced,
in other words, what one might call an ecological approach to psychological
phenomena. Koffka and Lewin in their turn influenced two American psychologists
J. J. Gibson and Roger Barker, both of whom (independently) conceived their
work under the banner of 'ecological psychology.' In what follows I shall
attempt, in the spirit of Gibson and Barker, to give an account of the
environment of mind in a way which will leave us in a position to understand
the way in which (C) and (D) have different representational scopes.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the Gestalt psychologists
were among the first to investigate the relations between mental experiences
and associated processes in the brain, they still, when turning to the
external environment of human behavior and perception, saw the latter as
something like a manifest image constructed by the human subject. Hence
they were left with the task - which we might think of as an externalized
counterpart of the mind-body problem - of explaining the relation between
this constructed environment and the world of physics.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To
see the nature of this problem, it will be useful to quote the passage
from Koffka's <i>Principles of Gestalt Psychology</i> in which a fateful
distinction between the psychological (or 'behavioral') and physical (or
'geographic') environments is introduced:</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On
a winter evening amidst a driving snowstorm a man on horseback arrived
at an inn, happy to have reached shelter after hours of riding over the
wind-swept plain on which the blanket of snow had covered all paths and
landmarks. The landlord who came to the door viewed the stranger with surprise
and asked him whence he came. The man pointed in the direction straight
away from the inn, whereupon the landlord, in a tone of awe and wonder,
said: 'Do you know that you have ridden across the Lake of Constance?'
At which the rider dropped stone dead at his feet.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>The Problem of the 'Two
Worlds'</b></span>
<br><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In what environment, Koffka
asks, did the behavior of the stranger take place? 'The Lake of Constance.
Certainly [... and it is] interesting for the geographer that this behaviour
took place in this particular locality. But not for the psychologist as
the student of behaviour.' The latter, Koffka insists, will have to say
that there is a second sense to the word 'environment,' according to which
'our horseman did not ride across the lake at all, but across an ordinary
snow-swept plain. His behaviour was a riding-over-a-plain, but not a riding-over-a-lake.'
(Koffka 1935, pp. 27f.)</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">How, then, are we to understand
the relationship between the physical and the psychological environment?
The tale of the ride across Lake Constance tells us that we cannot conceive
these two environments as identical in every case. Three alternatives can
now be distinguished:</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) We can say that these
two environments are always distinct (and thus embrace a 'two-world' hypothesis).
We then gain the advantage of a uniform domain for psychological science,
but we face the problem of explaining how this psychological domain (and
our psychological life) might ever come into contact with the domain of
physics.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) We can deny the usefulness
of the concept of psychological environment, and insist that it is the
geographic (physical, biological) environment that is relevant to the understanding
of psychological phenomena in every case. Our mental life is then subject,
on this account, to the possibility of a radical sort of ontological error.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Gestaltists embraced
the first of these two alternatives. They were consequently not able to
come to a coherent account of the relationship between the psychological
environment (and psychologically experienced objects) and the transcendent
world of physical things. This is true even of the most sophisticated theories
of the psychological environment such as those advanced by Kurt Lewin and
by Meinong's student Fritz Heider: the psychological environment is for
them, too, something that is dependent upon the ego (something that is
present even in dreams: Heider 1959a). And it is true, also, of mainstream
psychology today, which characteristically adopts the standpoint of 'methodological
solipsism.' Thus Fodor (1980) argues that if a genuine ('nomological')
science of psychology is to be possible at all, then a hypothesis of representationalism
must be adopted according to which mental processes are to be understood
n terms of relations that organisms bear to immanent mental representations.
The issue of the relationship between psychological and physical phenomena
is hereby bracketed forever in order to ensure an ontologically uniform
domain for psychological science within which both true and false beliefs
and both veridical and non-veridical perceptual phenomena can enjoy equal
civil rights.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">
<br></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Ecological Realism</b></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<br><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ecological psychologists,
in contrast, embraced the second alternative. Thus Gibson and Barker see
normal psychological experience not in terms of a succession of relations
between acts on the one hand and objects in some special 'realm' on the
other, but rather in terms of a <i>topological nesting,</i> whereby the
sentient organism is housed or situated within a surrounding physical environment
of which it serves as interior boundary.<sup><a href="#N_4_"> (4)</a><a href="#N_13_">(1)</a></sup>
Its perceptions and actions are dependent features of this total subject-environment
relation, and are capable of being properly understood only as occurring
within the wider surrounding framework. At the same time the environment
is itself to be conceived as something that falls within the realm of physics.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In perception, as in action,
from the Gibson-Barker point of view, we are embrangled with the very things
themselves in the surrounding world, and not, for example, with 'sense
data' or 'representations.' Perception is not a matter of the processing
of sensations. Rather, it is part of that direct linkage between the perceiving
organism and its environment which grows out of the fact that, in its active
looking, touching, tasting, feeling, the organism as purposeful creature
is bound up with those very objects - the ripened fruit, the crumpled shirt,
the empty glass, the broken spear - which are relevant to its life and
to its tasks of the moment.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Gibson and Barker thus embrace
a radically externalistic view of mind and action. We have not a Cartesian
mind or soul, with its interior theater of 'contents' or 'representations'
or 'beliefs and desires' and the consequent problem of explaining how this
mind or soul and its psychological environment can succeed, via intentionality,
in grasping objects external to itself. Rather, we have a perceiving, acting
organism, whose perceptions and actions are always already inextricably
intertwined with the parts and moments, the things and surfaces, of its
external environment.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For Gibson, reality as a
whole is a complex hierarchy of internested levels of parts and sub-parts:
molecules are nested within cells, cells are nested within leaves, leaves
are nested within trees, trees are nested within forests, forests are nested
within Special Federal Forest Protection Zones, and so on.<sup><a href="#N_5_">
(5)</a> </sup>Each type of organism is then <i>tuned</i> in its perception
and action to objects on a specific level within this complex hierarchy
- to objects ('affordances') which are the environmental correlates of
adapted traits on the side of the organism and which together form what
Gibson calls the organism's 'ecological niche'.<sup><a href="#N_6_"> (6)</a></sup>
A niche is that into which an animal
<i>fits </i>(as a hand fits into a
well-fitting glove). The niche is that in relation to which the animal
is habituated in its behavior.</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><sup><a href="#N_7_">
(7)</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></a></sup>
It embraces not only things of different sorts, but also shapes, textures,
boundaries (surfaces, edges), all of which are organized in such a way
as to enjoy affordance-character for the animal in question in the sense
that they are relevant to its survival. The given features motivate the
organism; they are such as to intrude upon its life, to stimulate the organism
in a range of different ways.</span></span>
<p>The perceptions and actions of human beings are likewise tuned<i> </i>to
the characteristic shapes and qualities and patterns of behavior of our
own respective (mesoscopic) environments. This mutual embranglement is
however in our case extended further via artefacts such as microscopes
and telescopes, and via cultural phenomena such as languages and institutions
of law and politics. To learn a language is in part to extend the range
of objects in relation to which we are able spontaneously to adjust our
behavior and thus it is to extend radically the types of niche or setting
into which we can spontaneously fit. Philosophers, in contrast, even those
philosophers with the ambition to come to grips with the realm of common-sense
experience, have shown a tendency to adopt philosophies which reduce this
realm - on the pattern of the doctrine of 'logical constructions' - to
objects of a monistic flavor. The Wittgensteinian conception of the common-sense
world in terms of 'language games' is an improvement on monistic theories.
Unfortunately, however, it puts the cart before the horse. This is first
of all because language, too, (if we are right) is a phenomenon which can
be understood only within the framework of an ontological theory of environments
- where language gets used such usage itself is under all normal circumstances
embedded within environmental contexts of one or other familiar sort. But
it is also, and more importantly, because to seek an account of our human
common-sense reality in terms of language, as some Wittgensteinians have
been wont to do, is to attempt to explain the whole in terms of one relatively
late-developed part. Thus it is to place obstacles in the path of accounting
for those many features of human behavior which are shared also by non-human
animals.
<p><b>Is Gibson a Realist?</b></span></span>
<br>A science of human environments will of course look very different
from any science of the more standard sort. The challenge, as Gibson saw,
is to develop a realist science of environmental settings which will be
'<i>consistent</i> with physics, mechanics, optics, acoustics, and chemistry'
by taking seriously the idea that ecological facts are 'facts of higher
order that have never been made explicit by these sciences and have gone
unrecognized.' (Gibson 1979, p. 17) He uses the term 'ecology' precisely
in order to designate the discipline that should encompass these higher-order
facts; it is 'a blend of physics, geology, biology, archeology, and anthropology,
but with an attempt at unification' on the basis of the question: what
can stimulate the organism? (Gibson 1966, p. 21)</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>Gibson thus stands out from the bulk of contemporary psychologists in
rejecting all varieties of representationalism in favor of a position he
calls 'direct realism' according to which (once again:) we are, as a result
of adaptation, bound up directly and spontaneously in our normal psychological
experience with the objects themselves in the physical world. We ourselves
form part of the physical environment.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>There is a puzzle, however. For Gibson's ecological perspective is in
other respects very close to representationalist and constructionist theories
of a distinctly idealist stripe. In an important paper entitled "Is Gibson
a Relativist?" Stuart Katz helps us to understand how this apparent conflict
could have arisen by drawing attention to passages in Gibson's work which
seem to negate the standard realist interpretation of his views and thus
draw him closer to the phenomenologists. Katz points in particular to the
following characteristic statements from Gibson's<i>Ecological Approach
to Visual Perception</i>: animal-and-<i>environment </i>make an inseparable
pair. Each term implies the other. No animal could exist without an environment
surrounding it. Equally, although not so obvious, an environment implies
an animal (or at least an organism) to be surrounded. (1979, p. 8) The
<i>affordances</i>
of the environment are what it <i>offers</i> the animal, what it<i>provides</i>
or <i>furnishes,</i>whether for good or ill. - I mean by [affordance] something
that refers to both the environment and the animal in a way that no existing
term does. It implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment:
an affordance is neither an objective property nor a subjective property;
or it is both if you like. An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective.
- It is both physical and psychical, yet neither (1979, p. 129). These
passages dictate, according to Katz, a reading of Gibson according to which
(as according to Uexk&uuml;ll) different species <i>live in different worlds</i>.
Water is for you and me a substance; for fish it is a medium which substances
inhabit. Hence the question arises: Do terrestrial animals perceive water
correctly and aquatic species incorrectly, or vice versa? Gibson as relativist
tells us no. Each lives in a different world and, complementarily, each
perceives differently. Water is a substance in one world and a medium in
another; it is not absolutely substance, nor is it absolutely medium. 'The
animal and its environment, remember, are reciprocal terms.' One could
never say what water is, without saying for whom it is, and conversely.
(Katz 1987, p. 120)</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p><b>Reasons for Representationalism</b></span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<br>But Katz's argument is flawed, and in coming to understand why this
is so, we will discover which modifications of standard methodologically
solipsist and representationalist views must be made if we are to bring
them into harmony with ecological realism.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>Note, first of all, that there are two principal motivations for representationalist
views of perception: (1) the problem of<i>error</i>, and (2) the problem
of seeming global incompatibilities between different systems of representations.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>The existence of perceptual error, according to familiar arguments (involving
bent sticks and the like), reveals that perception itself cannot be solely
a product of sensory inputs. It tells us that, on occasion at least, for
example in cases of hallucination, perceptual objects are in some sense
created or constituted by or with the help of the perceiver. A perceptual
representationalist is one who holds that the objects that are given in
perception are always constructed or constituted in this sense (hence they
belong to a special world, a world of representations). The representationalist
is thus able to do justice to the fact of perceptual error without abandoning
the goal of a unified theory of perception - but only at the price of cutting
off his theory from any roots in the real world of mind-independent objects.
The realist solution to the problem of error, on the other hand, denies
that what is phenomenologically experienced as the unitary phenomenon of
perception is in fact a unitary matter at all. Rather, we must distinguish
two types of perceptual setup, and correspondingly two distinct tasks for
the theory of perception. On the one hand is the task of providing a theory
of perception in the strict sense - a theory of successful, veridical,
world-embrangled perception of the normal sort. On the other hand is the
quite different task of giving an account of perceptual error (of the different
types of shortfall from this standard, veridical case).</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>The second motivation for representationalism might be formulated as
follows: our common-sense perceptual space has a Euclidean structure (or
a structure closely related thereto); the space of the physicist has another,
quite different structure; and it may well be that the perceptual spaces
of mice, of spiders, of clams, have other structures again. Not all of
these structures can be <i>true of</i> space as it is in itself. Hence,
the argument proceeds, our (and the mouse's, and the spider's) perceptual
spaces are mere 'representations'. And what goes for space holds for other
features of the manifold environments of perception, too, so that, again,
it is as if each species lives in its own special world.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>It is a constructivist, relativist, projectivist, Kantianist conclusion
of this sort which Katz attributes to Gibson. But, to remain with Katz's
own preferred example, space (as we may here assume) is a continuum. Like
all continua it can be partitioned in a range of mutually incompatible
ways (as a cheese can be sliced in such a way as to produce either triangular
or rectangular or disk-shaped segments but not all of these at once). All
members of a family of mutually conflicting 'perceptual spaces', now, may
very well turn out to be compatible after all, if they can be interpreted
as expressing distinct <i>partitions</i>, for example partitions on different
levels of granularity, of one and the same reality. In this way the second
motive for representationalism may be resisted, too, and with it also the
argument put forward by Katz for a representationalist reading of Gibson.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">
<br></span></span>
<p><b>The Big Cheese</b></span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<br>The world of environments, for Barker as for Gibson, is a complex hierarchy
of internested levels of parts and sub-parts. But neither Barker nor Gibson
has at his disposal a theory of <i>parts</i>or
<i>components</i> and of
the wholes into which they are nested; neither has, in other words, a
<i>mereology</i>,<sup><a href="#N_8_">
(8)</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></a></sup>
in terms of which it would be possible to formulate an overarching account
of the ways parts can fit together within their respective environments
and of how environments themselves can fit together in a larger, hierarchically
organized order. It is for this reason, I want to argue, that the ecological
approach appears to fall victim to the argument of Katz.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>With the resources of a general mereology, however, we are in a position
to comprehend within a single theoretical framework what is involved when
one and the same reality is partitioned in distinct, cross-cutting ways
by organisms or cognitive subjects approaching this reality each from its
own particular perspective.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>Mereology allows us to do justice to the ways in which, in the realm
of environmental settings, entities of radically different sorts are able
to become unified together into wholes: the unity in question is at least
in part a unity of psychological demarcation (it is analogous, as we suggested
above, to the unity involved in the geopolitical realm, where even spatially
widely scattered entities such as Indonesia or the United States are able
to enjoy the status of unitary wholes even in the absence of any physical
unification of their parts).</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></span></span>
<p>Mereology allows us finally to understand, in full conformity with the
realist perspective, how different languages, different theories, and different
systems of animal behavior and perception are able to generate their own
precisely fitting partitions of one single reality. The various animal
behavior-systems generate partitions of reality into <i>ecological niches</i>.
Human perception and action together generate that mesoscopic partition
of reality we call the common-sense world. And other sorts of partitioning
of reality are generated, for example, by the acts of physicists, paleontologists,
historians, and even mathematicians. (The mathematician, we might say,
is tuned to those subtle parts of reality which are its mathematical forms
or structures.) Each such group of disciplinary specialists lives in its
own precisely tailored disciplinary world, its precisely fitting surrounding
environment, exactly in the way described by Husserl in <i>Ideas </i>II.<sup><a href="#N_9_">
(9)</a></sup> Now, however, we can understand how this multiplication of
environments can be fully compatible with the realist perspective and with
the hypothesis of a single, common world. The ultimate ontology will be
scientific, but it will have room not only for physics but also for mesoscopic
structures built up on the basis of physics, especially structures of the
type to which everyday human behavior and perception are tuned.</span></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">

<p><a NAME="N_1_"></a>1. With thanks to Shimon Edelman. See http://www.ai.mit.edu/~edelman/archive.html
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a>2. I draw here on truthmaker approaches to the correspondence
theory of truth such as have been defended by Armstrong, Fox, and Mulligan,<i>
et al.</i>
<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a>3. One difference between the two events might be
this: the former is independent of Prunella, the latter not; compare the
relation between a man and a husband.
<p><a NAME="N_4_"></a>4. On the formal ontology of this organism-environment
relation, and on its Aristotelian roots, see Smith and Varzi 1999.
<p><a NAME="N_5_"></a>5. See Gibson 1986, p. 101.
<p><a NAME="N_6_"></a>6. Gibson's own account of this relationship of tuning
- in terms of information pick-up - need not detain us here. We are concerned,
rather, with the ontological underpinnings of the ecological theories of
Gibson and Barker, a detailed formal treatment of which is to be found
in Smith and Varzi 1999.
<p><a NAME="N_7_"></a>7. Gibson 1986, p. 129.
<p><a NAME="N_8_"></a>8. See Smith 1996, 1999; Smith and Varzi 1999.
<p><a NAME="N_9_"></a>9. Husserl's position in <i>Ideas </i>II is exactly
the position attributed by Katz to Gibson (with all the concomitant metaphysical
confusions; see my 1995).</span></span></blockquote>
