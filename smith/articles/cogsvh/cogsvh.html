<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">PART ONE: NAMES AND OBJECTS</FONT></B>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. Standard and Non-Standard Instances</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The theory of speech acts put forward by
Reinach in his "The A Priori Foundations of the Civil Law" rests on a systematic
account of the ontological structures associated with various different
sorts of language use. One of the most original features of Reinach's account
likes in his demonstration of how the ontological structure of, say, an
action of promising or of commanding, may be <I>modified</I> in different
ways, yielding different sorts of non-standard instances of the corresponding
speech act varieties. The present paper is an attempt to apply this idea
of standard and modified instances of ontological structures to the realm
of judgment and cognition. It is hoped that it will also do something to
justify the author's belief that Reinach's writings have a more than merely
historical interest.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It will be presupposed in what follow:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(1) that there are certain core
situations in which knowledge is gained or secured: principally situations
in which objects and states of affairs are directly given in perception;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(2) that these core situations
are surrounded by a periphery of what might be called natural deformations:
modified, derivative, or non-standard cases. These are either cases where
things go wrong in standard ways, or they are cases involving greater complexity,
for example as a result of the intervention of inference, memory or the
testimony of others;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(3) that there may occur also
isolated cases of unnatural deformations (we might also call them unnatural
instances of natural kinds), departing from the relevant standard instances
in irregular ways.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Aristotle, too, distinguished in his philosophy
of nature between <I>regular</I> non-standard instances, instances which
deviate from their kind in a law-governed way (as woman deviates in a law-governed
way from the kind <I>man</I>), and irregular non-standard instances, which
deviate from their relevant kind in purely accidental ways (as for example
in the case of a man with six toes).<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>
Effectively the same distinction is dealt with also by Reinach in his ontology
of legal formations, and Reinach was here able to draw on a certain tradition
in German legal theory in which, entirely in the spirit of Aristotle, the
characteristics of the various different dimensions of non-standard instances
of kinds of actions had been carefully investigated.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Much recent work on epistemology can also
be said to have embraced a similar distinction, though the influence of
Aristotle is now more difficult to detect.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP>
This is because this more recent work has concentrated overwhelmingly on
the invention of irregular non-standard cases - on the 'science fiction
examples' in category (3) - as a means of calling into question assumptions
about knowledge and belief that have hitherto been taken for granted. The
present paper is conceived both as a complement and as a corrective to
investigations of this kind. Its goal is the description of those simple
and straightforward acts of perceiving, judging and asserting, and of the
associated cognitive states of belief, in which we are directed towards
objects and states of affairs in the real world.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is not our purpose here to provide a
general ontological theory of instances and kinds. We shall rather simply
lay down certain marks by which the standard and non-standard instances
of specifically cognitive kinds may be distinguished, emphasising the provisional
character of the distinctions which result.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. Standard instances are first of all
prototypical:<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP> these are the instances
which come to mind when we reflect on the meanings of terms like 'judgment',
'doubt', and so on;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. standard instances are prior to non-standard
instances in the sense that they belong to earlier stages of cognitive
development; capacities associated with non-standard instances (for example
with dissimulating) will therefore presuppose capacities associated with
standard instances;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. standard instances of the kinds which
here concern us are associated with successful processes of gaining knowledge
of the real world; non-standard instances are associated with cognitive
dead-ends, or with processes which have nothing (directly) to do with gaining
knowledge (such as are involved, for example, in reading fiction).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The distinction between standard and non-standard
instances in the sphere of cognitive acts and states is therefore not merely
a matter of developmental psychology. Indeed, the privileged status of
standard instances of cognitive kinds turns most importantly on the fact
that such instances have especially close affinities with those - ideally
- more sophisticated processes of gaining knowledge of the world which
are grouped together under the label 'science'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Standard instances are privileged also,
as we shall see, by the fact that they satisfy <I>essential laws</I> in
the sense first clearly described by Husserl in his <I>Logical Investigations</I>.
More precisely, they satisfy - both as regards their internal structure
and as regards their relation to other objects - certain <I>conditional
necessities</I>, for example of the familiar form:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If as a matter of empirical fact
an instance of kind K exists, then as a matter of necessity an instance
of the kind K exists also.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Entire families of such conditional necessities
are provided by Reinach in his theory of speech acts, for example:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If as a matter of empirical fact
an instance of the kind <I>promise</I> occurs, then as a matter of necessity
there begin to exist enduring states of claim and obligation.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Principles of a similar form play an important
role in current work in linguistics, where they express what have been
called implicational universals (a term introduced by Jakobson).<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP><I>
</I>Part
of our task in the present essay will be that of laying down similar principles
obtaining in the sphere of cognition.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. Logic and States of Affairs</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is Reinach's paper "On the Theory of
the Negative Judgment" that will serve as our principal guide in what follows.
We can gain some initial idea as to what Reinach is about in this paper
if we examine his account lf logic. Logic, Reinach says, is a 'theory of
states of affairs'. Even those propositions of logic which are traditionaly
called 'laws of deduction' are 'nothing other than general principles expressing
relations between states of affairs'. There are 'profound implications
for the construction of logic which develop out of this insight' (339/83<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP>),
though unfortunately Reinach gives us only an inkling of what these implications
might be.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP> He tells us that</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">the fundamental principles of
traditional logic … have normally been related to judgments, for example:
two contradictory judgments cannot both be correct. This principle is certainly
incontestable, but it is a derived and not a primitive principle. A judgment
is correct if the state of affairs corresponding to it subsists; and two
contradictory judgments cannot both be correct <I>because</I> two contradictory
states of affairs cannot both subsist. The law pertaining to judgments
thus obtains its foundation from the corresponding law relating to states
of affairs (376/114, n.40).<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Clearly, however, if Reinach's new logic is
supposed to be simply a matter of substituting the term 'state of affairs'
for terms like 'judgment' or 'proposition' as these occur in traditional
formulations of logical principles, then there would be little reason for
devoting our energies to the study of his work.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is however a more fruitful reading
of "Zur Theorie des negativen Urteils", a reading which suggests itself
when we reflect on the context in which the work was written. It grew out
of a long collaboration between Reinach and his Munich colleagues on the
one hand and Husserl on the other, a collaboration which was directed to
the clarification and extrapolation of ideas sketched by Husserl in his
<I>Logical
Investigations. </I>The most important of these ideas was that of providing
a non-psychologistic foundation for logic in a way which would not, as
in the theories of Bolzano and Frege (and in almost all subsequent writings
on logic in the analytic tradition), simply detach logic from the empirically
existing thinkings, deducings and inferrings in which logical structure
is somehow embedded. Such a foundation would both allow us to affirm the
necessity of logical laws and show how such laws are applicable to empirically
occurring cognitive performances.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP> And
now I should like to suggest that Reinach's contribution to providing such
a foundation lies not simply in his having put forward the idea of a 'logic
of states of affairs'. It consists no less importantly in his having presented
the outlines of a theory of ontological structures in which not only states
of affairs but also the associated cognitive acts and conditions of consciousness
and the relevant objects in the world can be seen as being bound together
in different ways. The very title of his lost work on logic, <I>Wesen und
Systematik des Urteils</I>, as of its projected expansion, <I>Urteil und
Sachverhalt</I>, reveals that the reconstructed discipline would have to
do not merely with states of affairs but also with <I>judgments.</I></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach's logic has important implications,
therefore, for the ontology of cognition, and he himself provides in "Zur
Theorie des negativen Urteils" a detailed account of the structural structural
interconnections between:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(1) acts of judgment on the part of the
cognising subject,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(2) his states or conditions of belief,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(3) the states of affairs with which he
comes into cognitive contact.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He tended, however, to divorce too radically
the realm of states of affairs from the realm of objects -- anticipating
Wittgenstein in the view that states of affairs are set apart from objects
by the fact that it is only the latter which can be named. One task of
the present paper, therefore, will be to extend Reinach's ontology of cognition
to embrace also:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(4) the objects towards which the cognising
subject is directed, for example in his acts of perception,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- where 'object' shall be understood as
embracing not only continuants (substances, things), but also for example
conditions, processes and events.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. Intending Names</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Philosophical investigations in semantics
and cognitive theory have tended to take for granted the thesis that an
account of the meanings of judgments, whether in semantic or in psychological
terms, can take no account of the distinction between judgments which are
true and judgments which are false. An investigation of the standard instances
of the kind <I>judgment</I> will however unavoidably find itself awarding
a special place to those judgments which are true and indeed our principal
task in what follows will be to examine the relations true judgments bear,
both to the states of affairs which make them true and to the various things,
events and conditions associated therewith.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such properly cognitive relations are established
on the basis of more immediate and more primitive relations involving acts
directed not towards states of affairs but towards objects. To follow Reinach's
account of judgment we shall therefore need to spend some time at this
more basic level. We shall begin by looking at his treatment of acts directed
towards objects through the mediation of language.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Suppose, Reinach says,</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I am counting off the mountains
of Germany, either by calling out their names to someone else or by reciting
them to myself. In doing this I utter a large number of names, perhaps
very quickly one after the other, but obviously there is much more involved
here than mere utterances; in uttering the words I mean something by them,
i.e. precisely the mountains which they designate...whoever utters the
words understandingly thereby aims - with them or through them - at something
other (323/65).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Normally, of course, we use names not
in isolation or in succession but rather in the company of expressions
of other sorts. Consideration of the somewhat artificial case of the list
will, however, enable us to bring into prominence certain issues relating
to the intentionality of language which are too often skated over in the
more usual, sentence-based accounts. For Reinach's account of what is involved
in reading a list seems on the one hand to be a perfectly reasonable description
of a phenomenon with which we are all familiar. Yet on closer inspection
the idea that in merely reading off a list we should succeed thereby in
aiming towards objects - towards mountains scattered across Germany - begins
to seem like some form of magic. The subject executing the acts may be
unable to make any substantive contribution of his own in achieving this
directedness. He may be directed, in going through the list of names, to
mountains in Germany of which he has no knowledge and of which he has never
even heard. Reinach himself comes close to grasping how this feat is accomplished
when he lays stress on the fact that acts of <I>Meinen</I> (of meaning
or intending) must be 'tied up with the utterances of words' (343/66).
For as we shall see, it is in a certain sense language which does the work
in effecting that 'spontaneous directedness' which is here at issue.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. The Representative Theory of Names</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How, then, do names lend objective directedness
to acts of intending (<I>Meinen</I>) of the given sort? How are names,
as these figure in standard varieties of language-use, connected to the
objects which they name? Some initial light may perhaps be thrown on this
question if we reflect on a remark of Wittgenstein's to the effect that
'Die M&ouml;glichkeit des Satzes beruht auf dem Prinzip der Vertretung
von Gegenst&auml;nden durch Zeichen.'<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">But what is this '<I>Vertretung</I>'? Suppose
that some person X is the <I>Vertreter</I> or representive of some other
person or body Y and puts himself forward as such.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP>
Having once satisfied ourselves of the validity of X's credentials, we
tend thereafter - quite rightly - to accept him at his word, and to have
dealings with <I>him</I>, without concerning ourselves too much with the
principle for whom he stands proxy. It seems that something analogous holds
also when we have to do with names. Having once established that the credentials
of a given list, as a list of (names of) mountains, are in order - that
the list is derived, say, from a reputable encyclopedia -, we tend thereafter
to treat the names as directing us towards corresponding objects willy
nilly, without going to the trouble of ascertaining the precise nature
or reliability of the directedness in each particular case. It is for this
reason that, when we are reading through a list, we normally do not need
to concern ourselves in any special way with the successive objects listed.
And what holds for lists holds also for names taken individually. There
is a sense in which the name is something which goes proxy for, serves
as a representative or substitute of, the named object.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Two sorts of questions can be asked about
this name-object relation: concerning its origins in any given case - how
does the relation get established? - , and concerning its intrinsic nature
- in what does the relation consist? The distinction between standard and
non-standard cases would have to play a role in the answer to both sorts
of question, though we shall concentrate here on the latter only.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP>
We note, first of all, that a human being can <I>be</I> a representative
only if there exists some person or body for whom he stands proxy. Should
the principle cease to exist, then the representative goes out of existence
(or rather he ceases to function <I>in his capacity as a representative</I>:
the representation becomes 'ineffective' as Reinach says).<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It seems, however, that a name can do (standard)
duty as a name not merely in case the object which it names exists: it
can continue to stand proxy for its object even when this object has ceased
to exist. Indeed certain varieties of temporal object, for example battles
and natural disasters, are in general baptised only in times after they
have already occurred. The name-bearer relation is therefore distinguished
(in the standard case) at least in this, that name and object stand in
the relation of <I>one-sided existential dependence</I> expressed by:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(P1) A name cannot exist unless the object
which it names exists or has existed in the past.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The relation in question is 'one-sided',
rather than 'mutual', since the principle (P1) does not hold in reverse.
An object can perfectly well exist or have existed without being named.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The term 'dependence', here, is used in
the sense of Husserl's 3rd Logical Investigation (Husserl speaks also of
'foundation' or '<I>Fundierung</I>').<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP>
Relations of existential dependence, both one-sided and mutual, mediate
and immediate, will play a sizeable role in what follows. One virtue claimed
for the approach here adopted is indeed the economy with which it can deal
with a wide range of superficially heterogeneous phenomena in terms of
the single framework of the theory of dependence or foundation relations
between real objects. Both Husserl and Reinach apply the theory of dependence
relations throughout their work. Neither, however, explicitly applies the
theory to the relations between language and objects in the way suggested
in the text: a use of language (or indeed any mental act) may stand at
most in a relation of <I>co-existence</I> to its object.<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The principle (P1), so far as it goes,
does indeed seem to hold for standard cases of the name-object relation.
But it holds for other varieties of expression also. At a later stage in
our inquiries we shall find that there is a sense in which even certain
sorts of verb may, in given contexts, stand proxy for their objects. Here,
however, it will be sufficient to note that the category of uses of language
satisfying (P1) includes also those varieties of referring expression that
are created <I>in situ</I> by a speaker who associates some occasional
expression ('this', 'that', 'this hat', 'that cup') with an object that
is present to him (and to his audience) in perception. Here, too, we have
a relation of one-sided dependence between utterance and object, and what
we have to say about uses of names in what follows will be seen to apply,
<I>ceteris</I>
<I>paribus</I>, to utterances of this type also.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The family of non-standard cases of the
name-object relation is very large. It includes, somewhat paradoxically,
those cases where a name calls itself to the attention of its user in its
function as a representative, for example where it is used as a symbol
in a religious rite. For it is standardly the case in our use of names
that the names themselves play only an oblique role: no sooner are we directed
to them in consciousness than they bow off the stage in favour of their
objects. Other non-standard cases are those where, through slips of the
tongue, we mean one object despite the fact that we have used the name
of another. Such cases can only occur, however, where there is some independent
knowledge of or reference to the object meant on the part of the subject
in question. A more problematic variety of non-standard case is provided
by so-called empty names such as 'Pegasus' or 'Sherlock Holmes'. These
are, from the point of view of the representative theory, mere pieces of
language masquerading as names - much as an insincere utterance of the
words 'I promise' or 'I apologise' may masquerade as a social act of promising
or apologising in certain contexts. An empty name, according to the present
conception, is rather like a forged signature or bank-note: it is a 'name'
only in a modified sense. Reinach himself seems to take a Meinongian view
of this matter, a view according to which empty names are in fact standard
names of so-called non-existent objects.<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP>
We shall however ignore this aspect of Reinach's philosophy here, since
we are seeking to show how his ideas may throw light on our cognitive access
to what is real.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">5. What's in a Name?</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How, now, do name and object relate - in
the standard case - to the mental acts of meaning or intending with which
they are associated? This is a complex problem, a fully adequate treatment
of which would involve consideration - at the level of both species and
individual instance - of the name as used physical sign (as a <I>phonological</I>
or <I>graphological</I> <I>structure</I>) and of the name as sign meant
and understood by speaker and hearer. Further, it would involve a consideration
of the question how the same name can be used both in an overt linguistic
utterance and in silent speech. For the sake of simplicity, however, I
shall here ignore these complexities and talk somewhat loosely of the <I>name
as used</I>. The remarks above on the one-sided dependence of name and
object should be adjusted accordingly: not the name, but the name as (standardly)
used on some particular occasion of utterance, is such that it cannot exist
unless its object exists or has existed in the past.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">How, then, does the name as used relate
to the act in which it gets used to mean or intend an object? An act of
meaning or intending must be linguistically clothed: it is 'tied up with
the utterance of words'. (323/66) But equally, a used name, if it is to
be more than merely a complex of graphic or phonic marks, must be associated
with an act of <I>Meinen</I>. Here, too, it is relations of existential
dependence which we have before us. More precisely, there is a relation
of <I>two-sided</I> dependence between name and <I>Meinen</I>, and the
whole structure of mediate dependence between act, name and object may
be depicted somewhat as follows:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC="d1.jpg" HEIGHT=79 WIDTH=425>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Diagram 1</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In such a picture the elements of the picture
are representatives of objects. A solid frame signifies that the object
depicted exists independently (does not require any other object in order
to exist).<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP> Single lines connecting
broken to solid walls of adjacent frames represent relations of one-sided
dependence; double lines connecting adjacent broken walls represent relations
of two-sided or mutual dependence.<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21)</A></SUP>
Discrete frames connected neither directly nor indirectly by lines of dependence
represent discrete objects. Such frames behave exactly like the ovoids
of Venn or Euler diagrams. Objects represented by connected frames, however,
may overlap, or indeed stand to each other in a relation of (proper) part
to whole. Taken in isolation, therefore, the diagram above tells us nothing
as to the mereological relations between the objects depicted by its respective
frames.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This diagram is of course greatly simplified:
thus for example an act of <I>Meinen</I> will normally stand in dependence
relations to other, adjacent acts and conditions of the relevant subject,
and all of the depicted objects will have a more or less complex internal
structure of their own, not here depicted. These simplifications will however
be eliminated, to some extent, in the course of our discussions.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">6. Presentation</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is not only that sort of directedness
which involves what Husserl calls 'unfulfilled' or 'purely signitive' uses
of language which enables us to reach out to objects in the world. We can
be directed to objects also in such a way that the objects themselves are
present to us - as, most obviously, in cases of acts of perception. Such
direct presentation is indispensable to cognition, at least insofar as
cognition of realia is concerned. A consciousness whose directedness to
real objects was restricted to the mere intending of names might indeed
have some sort of knowledge of these objects, but if it were incapable
of being somehow cashed out in terms of knowledge that is not merely signitive
then it would be knowledge of a very inferior sort.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The various sorts of acts in which objects
are presented - as opposed to being merely meant - are called by Reinach
<I>Vorstellungen</I>,
a term here translated as 'presentation'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As we have seen, an act of <I>Meinen</I>
is <I>mediately</I> dependent upon its object. (See Diagram 1.) An act
of presentation, on the other hand, is characterised by an <I>immediate</I>
dependence: it is <I>of</I> its object in the strongest possible sense
(cf. 328/71). We see and hear, at least in normal cases, <I>the things
themselves</I>, not intermediary images, pictures or sense data, and we
are brought into contact with the things themselves in our acts of perception
in such a way that we do not have to call in aid linguistic proxies.<SUP><A HREF="#N_23_">(23)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The relative proximity to its object of
an act of presentation is manifested in the fact that, as Reinach points
out:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Anything which is presented is
such that we can turn toward it with a specific interest, raise it up out
of its surroundings, concern ourselves with its specific traits. In the
sphere of meaning, in contrast, there is no possibility of such modifications.
(324/67)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Given that an act of presentation is
itself dependent on its subject (on the relevant perceiving organism),
this act may be considered as a <I>relation</I> between this subject and
the object presented thereto, somewhat as follows:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC="d2.jpg" HEIGHT=79 WIDTH=426>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Diagram 2</B><SUP><A HREF="#N_24_">(24)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here, however, we are interested only in
the dependence relation on the right-hand side. This relation is not analytic:
it is not a mere reflection of our conceptual stipulations (a charge which
can very easily be levelled against dependence relations of the sort that
are depicted in Diagram 1). This is shown by the fact that the act of presentation
is sensitive in its internal structure to (among other things) the structure
of the presented object, as would become clear were we to take account
in our diagram of the internal structures of the objects depicted. As Reinach
himself puts it, there exist</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">essential connections which correlate
of necessity the various types of object with corresponding types of presenting
acts. Colours can after all <I>only</I> be seen... One sees immediately
that a quite different situation obtains for the case of acts of meaning
an object. We speak understandingly of colours, tones, values, numbers,
physical things...but there are no qualitative differences on the side
of acts of meaning which would correspond to the qualitative differences
among the objects (325/68).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Yet meaning acts may clearly be accompanied
by intuitive <I>images</I> of various sorts. Reinach however insists that
our understanding of language is independent of such images. His rejection
of the idea that linguistic meaning is to be explained in terms of ideas
or images is in fact no less vehement than that of the later Wittgenstein.
Associated images are for Reinach still more remote from the object than
is the act of <I>Meinen</I>: the intuitions accompanying - and sometimes
outlasting - an act of <I>Meinen</I> are 'mere schemata', having</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">only an insignificant influence
upon the steady succession of acts of meaning, like ripples on the surface
of a river... They do not 'exhibit' or 'present' anything - for of course
in the sphere of <I>Meinen</I> there is absolutely nothing to hand which
is presented. Rather, they partake of an existence which floats quite free
from the object that is meant (328/71).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Or, again:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I hear the sentence 'Orange lies
between red and yellow', and I understand this sentence. I can understand
it without it being the case that I have the intended state of affairs
before me in any way. The understanding can be entirely non-intuitive;
and even in those cases where images and schemata of all kinds rise to
the surface, this activity should not be confused with the state of affairs
standing before me intuitively.<SUP><A HREF="#N_25_">(25)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are also however those cases,
already mentioned in passing above, where the intending use of a name -
or more commonly of an indexical expression like 'this' or 'that' - is
connected together in a single consciousness with a <I>presentation</I>
of the intended object (323f./66). This results in a structure of the sort
depicted in Diagram 3:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC="d3.jpg" HEIGHT=202 WIDTH=431>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Diagram 3</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Each such indexical <I>Meinen</I> is founded
upon an associated presentation: it exploits this presentation to gain
its objectual directedness (as when, looking up into the sky, I say 'that
bird is flying high'). A normal (and non-anaphoric) use of an expression
like 'that bird' stands not merely in need of grammatical completion (in
such a way as to yield a sentential utterance); it must be completed also
by some sort of heterogrammatical phenomenon, normally by acts of perception
on the part of both speaker and hearer.<SUP><A HREF="#N_26_">(26)</A></SUP>
Something has gone wrong, or very special contextual conditions are in
force, if I say 'that bird is flying high' in the absence of an associated
perception, either on my own part or on the part of my interlocuter.<SUP><A HREF="#N_27_">(27)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This last example should alert us to the
fact that dependence diagrams of the sort here illustrated can be used
not only as a means of setting out the structures of standard cases. They
can be used also as a means of gaining an overview of different types of
candidate non-standard cases: we need only imagine specific elements depicted
in a given diagram to have been eliminated, or somehow modified. The case
just mentioned is that which results when we imagine that there is lacking
an appropriate presentation. Another such case is yielded when we imagine
that the object is missing (as when I say 'that bird is flying high', but
I have been deceived by a trick of the light and there is no bird), and
further cases come about when we imagine various different sorts of mismatch
between the elements involved.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">PART TWO: JUDGMENTS AND STATES OF AFFAIRS</FONT></B>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">7. What is a <I>Sachverhalt</I>?</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach himself is reluctant to answer
this question. He lists certain characteristics of states of affairs:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">they are that which is believed
and affirmed, which stand in the relation of ground and consequent, which
possess modalities, and which stand in the relation of contradictory positivity
and negativity (341/86),<SUP><A HREF="#N_28_">(28)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and he tells us that these determinations
are <I>sufficient</I>, that is, every entity to which they apply is a state
of affairs. He clearly thinks that they are sufficient also in the sense
that through them the reader is sufficiently informed about what a state
of affairs is. But he recognises that they do not strictly speaking constitute
a <I>definition</I> of the term 'state of affairs'. He argues, however,
that it is</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">questionable, for such most primitive
objectual formations as states of affairs, things and processes, whether
definitions are possible at all, and whether, if they were possible, we
could achieve anything with their aid (341/86).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Yet in the absence of a positive determination
of the nature of <I>Sachverhalte</I> and of the connections between <I>Sachverhalte</I>
and objects (or 'factual material': <I>unterliegende sachliche Tatbestandsmaterial</I>),
Reinach cannot be sure that the characteristics of states of affairs which
he lists are or even could be satisfied simultaneously by any entities
at all.<SUP><A HREF="#N_29_">(29)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We are offered something in the way of
a more positive account, but this is within the terms of a Platonism which
Reinach shared Husserl and Meinong. We are told that</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(a) <I>Sachverhalte</I> are independent
of any judgment or cognition on our part;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(b) that they constitute a special 'realm',
distinct from the realm of objects;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(c) that they enjoy an eternal existence:
objects (realia), for Reinach, may come and go, but <I>Sachverhalte</I>
are immutable (a view which is of course almost exactly the reverse of
that embraced by Wittgenstein in the <I>Tractatus</I>).<SUP><A HREF="#N_30_">(30)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are, however, some passages in "Zur
Theorie des negativen Urteils", passages almost certainly reflecting the
influence of Reinach's other mentor, Johannes Daubert, which suggest a
different, ontologically more modest approach to <I>Sachverhalte</I> -
one which can allow at least some <I>Sachverhalte</I> a place within the
real, material world.<SUP><A HREF="#N_31_">(31)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Thus Reinach tells us, in relation to the
<I>Sachverhalte</I>
picked out by the judgments 'this rose is red', 'redness inheres in this
rose', 'this rose forms the substrate of this redness', that</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">it is the same factual material
which lies at the basis of each, but they comprehend this factual material
in quite different ways and in quite different directions (336/79).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And similarly:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The red rose exists, the rose
is red, a specific instance of red inheres in this rose; the rose is not
white, not yellow, etc. The red rose, this <I>dingliche Einheitskomplex</I>
is the factual material which underlies each and every one of these states
of affairs. (340/85)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Such <I>Sachverhalte</I>, then, are
somehow founded on a certain factual material (a certain complex of rose
and colour-instance), and the differences between them have to do with
the ways in which this material is 'comprehended' [<I>aufgefasst</I>] by
judgments or concepts. It is this account of <I>Sachverhalte</I> which
we shall elaborate below. Of course, when Reinach himself says that a certain
complex of objects 'underlies' a state of affairs, he himself could not
have had explicitly in mind the idea that the objects are such that the
state of affairs is founded or dependent on them in the precise sense of
Husserl's theory of dependence relations. For to say that a foundation
relation obtains between a and b is to say, in the simplest possible case,
that a is necessarily such that it cannot exist unless b exists. The existence
of a is somehow tied to that of b. Clearly if either a or b exist necessarily,
then such a relation cannot obtain. Foundation relations obtain, then,
only between contingently existing entities, and a view of <I>Sachverhalte</I>
as contingent entities would conflict with Reinach's Platonism.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In fact it seems that Reinach is unable,
within this Platonistic framework, to give any very satisfactory account
of the relation between objects and states of affairs. Why, then, was he
attracted by the Platonistic idea? First of all, because he had formulated
his conception of logic as a theory of states of affairs in order to solve
- in a Husserlian spirit - the problem of psychologism. He therefore held
that, in order to guarantee the necessity of logical laws, it was necessary
to grant to <I>Sachverhalte</I> a special, extraterrestrial status of just
the sort which was granted to propositions by Bolzano and by Frege. The
applicability of logic to human cognitive performances would then be guaranteed
by showing how mental acts and states may relate, in different ways, to
<I>Sachverhalte</I>
thus conceived. Reinach adopted a Platonistic position also however because
he held - with Meinong and Marty - that in order to uphold the correspondence
theory of truth in its full generality it is necessary to suppose that
to each variety of judgment there is correlated an appropriate variety
of truth-making states of affairs.<SUP><A HREF="#N_32_">(32)</A></SUP>
This applies, in particular, to negative judgments, which would be correlated
with 'negative states of affairs'. And now, whilst it may be possible to
conceive a positive state of affairs like <I>this rose is red</I> as some
sort of real complex, no such view is possible for negative states of affairs
like <I>this rose is not yellow</I> or <I>unicorns do not exist</I>, for
the latter cannot be counted as denizens of the real world alongside things,
processes and events.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Both Wittgenstein's <I>Tractatus</I>, which
embraces only positive states of affairs, and Ingarden's critique of Reinach's
theory in <I>Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt</I>, which sees negative
states of affairs as enjoying an inferior (merely intentional) status,
show that it is possible to develop a correspondence theory within a non-Platonistic
framework.<SUP><A HREF="#N_33_">(33)</A></SUP> Our task here, however,
is the more modest one of providing an account of the structures of the
simplest and most straightforward varieties of positive states of affairs
and of the cognitive acts and states bound up therewith. And we shall see
that it is possible to develop a non- Platonistic conception of such states
of affairs by making use of Reinach's idea (336/79) that <I>Sachverhalte</I>
are entities in which given real objects are 'comprehended... in different
ways and in different directions'. Details of this conception will follow
shortly. At this stage we need point out only that it will involve the
thesis that states of affairs stand in a relation of foundation to the
objects they comprehend.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">8. Judgment and Belief</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">What, now, about the properly cognitive
relations of judgment and belief - relations which are directed not towards
objects but towards states of affairs? How are these relations built up
on the basis of the different sorts of object- directedness treated in
Part One? Here it will turn out that indexical phenomena have a particularly
important role to play, for it is such phenomena which mediate between
the direct access to objects which occurs in presentation and the indirect
access to objects <I>via</I> states of affairs which is characteristic
of cognition in the strict sense. In order to do full justice to these
matters, however, we shall have to deal not only with:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(1) the <I>meaning</I> or <I>intending</I>
of an object by means of a name,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(2) the <I>presentation</I> of an object
in perception,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(3) the <I>indexical meaning</I> of an
object which comes about when meaning and presentation operate in consort
with each other,<SUP><A HREF="#N_34_">(34)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">but also with three further sorts of relation
(with three determinates of the determinable 'cognition'):</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(4) the <I>apprehension</I> that such and
such is the case,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(5) the <I>conviction</I> that such and
such is the case,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(6) the <I>assertion</I> that such and
such is the case.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Quite special difficulties are raised by
these last relations. As will soon become clear, the structures involved
are woven together to such an extent that it is difficult to deal with
any one without dealing simultaneously with all the others.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>9. Apprehension (Seeing That)</B><SUP><A HREF="#N_35_">(35)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Apprehension is something like the reading
off of a state of affairs from the perceived surface of reality. 'Whether
one is speaking of what is visible, of what is audible or of what is smellable,'
Reinach tells us, 'the corresponding state of affairs will not itself be
seen, heard or smelt but rather <I>apprehended</I>' (342/87). Apprehending
is like <I>Meinen</I> in being temporally of a completely punctual nature
and in admitting of no gradations of certainty of the kind which lead from
conviction to doubt (334/90). Apprehension is unlike <I>Meinen</I>, however,
in that it is not essential to it that it be linguistically clothed. Reinach's
theory implies, in fact, that it is not the act of apprehension which is
brought to expression in language, but the state of belief or conviction
that is founded thereon. An apprehension does not need to call in aid the
help of language because in every case it gains its directedness to its
object through a presentation. Indeed we can assert the principle:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(P2) If an instance of the species <I>apprehension</I>
(<I>seeing that</I>) occurs, then as a matter of necessity one or more
instances of the species <I>presentation</I> (<I>seeing</I>, <I>hearing</I>,
etc.) occur also.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The dependence in question is one-sided:
the majority of our presentations are not accompanied by acts of apprehension
- if only for the reason that presentation manifests a foreground/background
structure, and only that which belongs to the foreground of any given presentation
can serve as object of an apprehending act.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Apprehending, we can now say, is the core
act in which we are related to states of affairs in the world of what happens
and is the case. There are also however derivative acts in which we are
so related, acts not founded wholly and directly on presentations of underlying
objects but rather, for example, on memory. Thus there is what Reinach
calls the 'bare bringing to mind' of a state of affairs:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I can bring to mind from memory
the being red of the rose, without needing to perceive the rose itself.
Just as the apprehension of the state of affairs rested upon a genuine
presentation of the thing, so this bringing to mind of the state of affairs
rests on a mere bringing to mind of that same thing. (343/88)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is also a variety of bringing
to mind of states of affairs which involves the essential mediation of
language, for example as occurs in our use of written or spoken testimony.
Here there may be lacking even the mediate connection to reality which
is vouchsafed by memory. And then of course the mediate <I>seeing that</I>
which is involved, e.g. in the reading and taking in of a newspaper article,
is essentially different from the immediate apprehension which is involved
in hearing that the explosion has occurred or in seeing that the peach
before me is red.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The bringing to mind of states of affairs
can be, within given boundaries, an almost <I>ad libitum</I> affair:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">to a given thing as body of factual
material [<I>zu demselben Dingtatbestand</I>] there belongs a plenitude
of states of affairs. Thus on the basis of the bringing to mind of the
rose, I can bring to mind the being red of the rose, the being non-yellow
of the rose, and so on (343/88).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And of course this freedom in bringing
to mind states of affairs extends even further, for example to those kinds
of acts with which we are familiar in our experiences of fiction (experiences
which involve also the use of name-like expressions where there is no right-hand
relatum of the resulting act).</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">10. Conviction</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The origin of conviction, in the standard
case, is described by Reinach as follows:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Imagine that there has arisen
a question between myself and someone else concerning the colour of a particular
object. I step up to the object and I see that it is red. The being red
of the object is here given to me, and as it comes to be given to me there
develops within me the relevant conviction or belief that the object is
red (317/59).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As he points out, the conviction that
is immediately founded in an act of apprehending may endure even when appropriate
reconfirming apprehensions are no longer available. It is also necessarily
such that it is able to find direct or immediate <I>expression</I>, i.e.
become linguistically clothed in an assertion (317/59: see 12 below).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We are using the terms 'belief' and 'conviction'
interchangeably, as translations of Reinach's '<I>&Uuml;berzeugung</I>'.
Reinach employs this term to designate something which he describes as
'actual', cognate with phenomena such as conjecture and doubt, and contrasted
with dispositions, which are merely latent.<SUP><A HREF="#N_36_">(36)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach thereby distinguishes between states
of belief, and what results when such states pass away to 'leave behind...inactual
knowledge', for example in certain sorts of memory (355/97). The state
or condition of belief is actual in the sense that, at all times during
the period for which it endures, we can become immediately aware of it
in reflection. It is not actual, however, in any sense which would imply
that it could be identified with sequences of mental <I>acts</I> (320/63).
In fact, in order to produce a theory that is adequate to the various dimensions
of structure in consciousness it is necessary to distinguish between at
least three different categories:<SUP><A HREF="#N_37_">(37)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. <I>events</I> (which are punctual in
nature): for example an act of judging or deciding;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. <I>processes</I> (which take time but
in such a way that their successive phases are not homogeneous), for example
a process of deliberating or following an argument;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. <I>states or conditions</I> (which take
time but in such a way that their successive phases are homogeneous) -
category 3. being further divided into actual and non-actual cases.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here we are concerned more specifically
with that kind of conviction or belief which develops on the basis of the
apprehension of states of affairs. As we have seen, such conviction can
outlive the apprehension on which it is founded; indeed it can endure even
when the state of affairs in question no longer obtains. Just as apprehending
is the core <I>act</I> in which we become related to states of affairs,
the act in which we become related to states of affairs in the standard
case, so conviction founded in apprehending is the core <I>condition</I>
in which we continue to be so related for a longer or shorter period of
time thereafter.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Conviction, in the standard case, is founded
on apprehension. It might therefore be supposed that we could conceive
conviction and apprehension as bound together by a one- sided relation
of dependence of just the sort that holds between apprehension and presentation
- with the single difference that conviction is an enduring condition (state,
<I>Zustand</I>,
<I>hexis</I>), where apprehension is a punctual act. Closer reflection
suggests, however, that an act which might putatively be described as one
of apprehension which did not immediately give rise to a conviction of
the corresponding content would have all the marks of a non-standard case
(compare a putative promise which did not immediately give rise to mutually
correlated claim and obligation). For what would it be like for me to apprehend,
say, that it is raining, and yet not believe it, not even momentarily?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This suggests the principle:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(P3) An act of apprehending is necessarily
such that it cannot exist unless an associated conviction, relating to
one and the same <I>Sachverhalt</I>, comes into being with the performance
of the act in question.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Given that we also have:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">(P4) A state of conviction is necessarily
such that it cannot exist unless an associated act of apprehension exists
or has existed,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">it follows that conviction, or more precisely
that type of standard conviction which is here at issue, stands to apprehension
in a relation of mutual foundation.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We might conceive the act of apprehension
as something like the <I>threshold</I> from presentation to conviction.
Apprehension is also, as we shall conceive matters, founded one-sidedly
on the apprehended state of affairs,<SUP><A HREF="#N_38_">(38)</A></SUP>
and this in turn - according to the account to be presented below - is
founded on associated objects. Further, like conviction and presentation,
apprehension is founded on the relevant subject. This gives rise to a structure
somewhat as follows:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC="d4" HEIGHT=444 WIDTH=605>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Diagram 4</B><SUP><A HREF="#N_39_">(39)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We might read this diagram as follows:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- subject and objects exist independently;<SUP><A HREF="#N_40_">(40)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- the act of assertion is founded one-sidedly
on the subject, on his state of conviction, and on the relevant state of
affairs;<SUP><A HREF="#N_41_">(41)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- the state of conviction is founded one-sidedly
on the subject and on the state of affairs, and mutually on the act of
apprehending;<SUP><A HREF="#N_42_">(42)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- the act of apprehending is founded one-sidedly
on subject, state of affairs and presentation, and mutually on the state
of conviction to which it gives rise;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- the presentation is founded one-sidedly
on the subject and on the objects perceived;</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">- the state of affairs is founded one-sidedly
on the objects which it comprehends.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are different <I>routes</I> through
this diagram. When a conviction has been established, then it continues
to be referred to (<I>bezogen auf</I>) one and the same state of affairs,
but there will normally come a time when this objectual reference is no
longer mediated through a <I>presentation</I> of the given state of affairs.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">11. Derivative Forms of Conviction</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The most common variety of non-standard
conviction is that which is established on the basis of an apprehension
that is false:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If I discern from afar the approach
of a cyclist, then speaking purely descriptively this is an apprehension
even should it be the case that in reality it is not a cyclist at all who
is approaching but rather, say, a cow (375/90, n. 26).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach places all states of affairs, both
positive and negative, subsisting and non-subsisting, on the same ontological
level, drawing distinctions between them only in regard to the manner of
our cognitive access. Hence in regard to the distinction between true and
false apprehension - as the distinction between apprehension of subsisting
and non-subsisting states of affairs - he has very little to say. In what
follows, however, we shall find it indispensable to emphasise the difference
between true and false judgments (and between their respective ontological
correlates) - and to seethe latter as derivative of the former - and then,
given the general aims of the present essay, it will be incumbent upon
us to concentrate the bulk of our attentions on the non-derivative case.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach does provide a detailed treatment
of a related family of non-central cases of cognitive access, cases involving
<I>negative
conviction:</I></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">If we simply look out at the world
which surrounds us, we are confronted by a plenitude of states of affairs
which we behold, and towards which our convictions are subsequently related.
It is clear that only positive convictions can develop in this way. A negative
conviction could never arise through a simple <I>reading off </I>of a state
of affairs from without; for such a conviction always presupposes that
we approach an existing state of affairs with a prior intellectual attitude
relating to a second, conflicting state of affairs. The conflicting state
of affairs may be, for example, believed, conjectured, doubted, or merely
put into question, but as we behold the other state of affairs the original
positive conviction or conjecture, doubt, uncertainty or question becomes
transmuted into or finds its answer in a negative conviction or disbelief
(333/75f.)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">First comes prior conviction in some
non-obtaining state of affairs S; then comes apprehension of a conflicting
state of affairs S; and this in turn brings about a disbelief (negative
conviction) in S. Diagrammatically, this might be represented as follows:</FONT>
<P><IMG SRC="d5.jpg" HEIGHT=359 WIDTH=605>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Diagram 5</B><SUP><A HREF="#N_43_">(43)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This negative conviction in a positive
state of affairs is to be contrasted, on Reinach's theory, with the case
of positive conviction in a negative state of affairs. The latter presupposes
the apprehension of an associated positive state of affairs, as for example
when we acquire the positive conviction that John is not smaller than Tom.
This can come about, Reinach would argue, only on the basis of the apprehension
that Tom is smaller than (or has the same height as) John. The difference
between this and the former case lies in the fact that</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">there it was necessary that a
state of affairs be apprehended which stood in conflict with the judged
positive state of affairs. Here in contrast the judged negative state of
affairs … stands with the apprehended [positive] state of affairs … in
a relation of necessary connection of such a kind that the subsistence
of the one is directly bound up with the subsistence of the other (353/96).<SUP><A HREF="#N_44_">(44)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is not our business here to deal with the
detailed implications of Reinach's subtle and original theory of the different
possible combinations of positive and negative conviction and judgment.
Suffice it to point out that he distinguishes two principal ways in which
negation may play a role in our cognitive experience. On the one hand we
have what he calls the simple negative judgment (simple negative assertion),
resting on a positive conviction in a negative state of affairs. And on
the other hand we have the polemical negative judgment, resting on a negative
conviction and directed not towards a state of affairs but towards another
judgment, one which is taken to embody error. As Reinach points out, this
latter, polemical negative judgment plays by far the more prominent role
in the practice of science. Science has little room for simple negative
judgments: it is concerned to establish how things are, not how they are
not.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There is one further non-standard variety
of conviction which it is perhaps worth mentioning in passing. Diagram
4 depicts conviction and apprehension as mutually dependent on each other.
There is however a broader notion of 'conviction' which results when this
restriction is abandoned: one can perflectly well be convinced of something
in this wider sense without oneself having apprehended that it is the case.
The process of education, we might suppose, consists primarily in instilling
convictions of this derivative sort, and Cartesian philosophy rests on
the presupposition that it is possible to eliminate all such derivative
convictions in favour of convictions that are well-founded in apprehending
acts. An intermediate case between well-founded and instilled conviction
would be the case where one acquires convictions through the reading of
a text or the following of an argument. To the extent, however, that such
reading gives rise to conviction in the strict and proper sense, then apprehensions
on the part of the reader are involved. I leave aside here consideration
of those religious dogmas - e.g. the dogma of the Trinity - in relation
to which it is sometimes claimed that conviction may obtain without even
the possibility of apprehension.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">12. Assertion</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Returning, now, to the standard cases of
cognitive access, it is time to address ourselves to the structures that
are involved when the conviction directed to a state of affairs becomes
<I>expressed</I>
in an assertion. Assertion relates to apprehension in the sphere of judgment
in very much the way that <I>Meinen</I> relates to presentation in the
sphere of object-directed acts. An apprehending is distinguished by the
fact that the correlated state of affairs is 'in the fullest sense, there
for me, where in an assertion it is in contrast merely meant' (344/89).
An assertion, that is to say, gains its directedness to objects, and therefore
also to states of affairs, only via linguistic proxies. Assertions are
'made', Reinach says; they are put together out of words. Thus an assertion
'is totally different from any … condition, and is much rather to be characterised
as a spontaneous act' (320/62). Even if apprehension and assertion should
take place simultaneously, we should have to deal with two distinct acts,
one involving <I>Meinen</I>, the other involving presentation. From the
point of view of the dependence structures involved, apprehension comes
first. Apprehension gives rise to conviction, on the foundation of which
an assertion may then be erected in turn. Indeed an assertion must, according
to Reinach, be built up on the basis of a condition of belief in the relevant
state of affairs. Where such conviction is lacking we have not assertion
but some other, derivative phenomenon. As Reinach puts it:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">No assertion is possible which
is not accompanied by an underlying conviction which is such that both
the assertion and the belief relate to something strictly identical. It
is, in contrast, not necessary that <I>every</I> conviction or belief founds
an assertion, and it is even excluded that an assertion should underlie
a conviction (320/62).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This conviction must in addition be
<I>positive</I>:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It belongs to the essence of assertion
(assertive positing) that that which is asserted is <I>believed</I>; thus
if there should develop in the sphere of conviction a <I>disbelief</I>
then it must be transmuted into a belief in the contradictory state of
affairs before an assertion can develop out of it (355/97).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even a negative assertion must be founded
on a positive conviction (otherwise it is not an assertion but some other,
derivative phenomenon). This was acknowledged also by Frege, whose <I>Begriffsschrift</I>
recognises only one (positive) moment of assertive force.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now Brentano, as is well known, claimed
that every judgment is necessarily founded on a presentation (cf. 330/73f.).<SUP><A HREF="#N_45_">(45)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This is clearly not so, Reinach argues,
if the term judgment' is used in the sense of assertion:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Here one must not allow oneself
to be led astray by the apparently self-evident thesis that I can only
judge about that which I know, and which is, therefore, somehow present
to me (329/72).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Certainly I must be related in some
way - and in some sense - to that about which I make an assertion, but
it is not only presentation which can provide such a relation. As we have
seen, I can be related to objects also in acts of <I>Meinen</I> - a variety
of act which is not recognised by Brentano, whose understanding of the
relation of language and thinking is in general less sophisticated than
that of either Husserl or Reinach. Indeed an act or acts of <I>Meinen</I>,
as Reinach points out, 'constitute the necessary foundation for every act
of assertion' (329/72).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Yet from following through Reinach's own
analyses, we can see that there is a grain of truth in Brentano's claim.
Consider, first, that central case of assertion which is founded on conviction
rooted in perceptual apprehension - the case illustrated in Diagram 4.
Here it is certainly true that there is a route from assertion to state
of affairs (and from there to objects judged about) which does not involve
the mediation of presentation. But it is still true that the assertion
is founded, mediately, on a presentation - even though the presentation
is typically one that existed in the past. It is therefore only in regard
to the derivative cases, where conviction is founded not on perceptual
apprehension but e.g. on memory or on what Reinach calls 'knowing about',
that Brentano's claim may be called into doubt (cf. 330/73f.). But even
here there is some route back to presentations and to the convictions associated
therewith, even though these presentations need not be one's own (they
may be, for example, those of the author of an article in an encyclopedia).
Such a route would seem to be entirely lacking only in cases where, for
example, a fictional text is mistakenly interpreted as fact, or where an
assertion is made by someone on the basis of the acceptance as truth of
someone else's lie. And even in the latter, deviant cases there will always
be <I>some</I> presentations involved (for example presentations of the
corresponding pieces of language). Assertion cannot spring from out of
nowhere.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">13. Assertion and <I>Sachverhalt</I></FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Regarding the <I>structure</I> of an assertion,
Reinach tells us that we may distinguish 'the specific moment of assertion
on the one hand from the constituent of meaning or intending (<I>Meinen</I>)
on the other' (330/72). 'It is the moment of assertion which makes the
negative judgment, just as much as the positive judgment, into a judgment
at all' (362/105). The moment of assertion in the Reinachian framework
is therefore equivalent to Frege's 'assertive force'. The assertion is
constituted from both moment of assertion and total meaning (<I>Gesamtmeinen</I>),<SUP><A HREF="#N_46_">(46)</A></SUP>
the former being founded on the latter. This total meaning may also be
governed by, for example, the moment of questioning (356/98).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The moment of assertion attains <I>through</I>
the meaning- component its relation to the relevant state of affairs -
its 'foothold in the facts', to use Ryle's expression.<SUP><A HREF="#N_47_">(47)</A></SUP>
It thereby attains its relation to the relevant objects though the signs
used in the making of the assertion. In the simplest possible case this
gives rise to a structure something like this (the reader is asked to suppose
that the assertion in question is made by someone who has in mind, or in
sight, some one particular hit):</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><IMG SRC="d6.jpg" HEIGHT=472 WIDTH=566>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Diagram 6</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As already stated in connection with Diagram
1, objects pictured by discrete frames in such a diagram need not themselves
be discrete. Normally it is clear from the nature of the objects represented
whether or not they may overlap (or stand in other mereological relations).
Thus in Diagram 3, for example, act of presentation and used name are clearly
discrete from each other. In the present case, however, our diagram involves
in this respect two important ambiguities, not so easily resolved.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The diagram is first of all consistent
both with a view according to which the <I>Gesamtmeinen</I> is discrete
from the respective intendings of names, and also with a view according
to which it includes these intendings as proper parts. The latter view
- which sees the assertion as just a certain determinately formed complex
of intendings of names governed by a certain assertive force - is clearly
in a certain sense more economical. Yet it has the consequence that it
rules out any conception of the act of assertion as a temporally punctual
event, since the separate acts of intending which would then be its parts
succeed each other in time. That an act of assertion <I>is</I> punctual
is something which Reinach takes for granted (cf. 320/62), and it seems
clear that it is at least phenomenologically not capable of being interrupted.
For this reason, therefore, we prefer to view the assertion as being discrete
from the acts of intending of names (and of course of expressions of other
sorts - to be dealt with shortly) upon which it is founded. Even this interpretation
leaves us however with the question: <I>when</I> does the assertion take
place? With the execution of the first act of <I>Meinen</I>? Of the last
act? We shall not seek to answer this question here. We note only that
exactly the same question arises with regard to the hearing of a melody:
do we hear the melody already when we hear the first note? Only when we
have registered all the notes?</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The second, parallel ambiguity turns on
the question whether the <I>Sachverhalt</I> is to be conceived as discrete
from the respective founding objects or as being such as to include these
objects as parts. Of course, given our diagrammatic conventions, we could
retain an open mind on this question, merely noting once again that an
exactly parallel question arises in relation to the melody that we hear.
(Does it comprehend its notes as parts? Or is it rather, as Ehrenfels argued,
a special <I>Gestalt</I> quality, founded on the notes but discrete therefrom?<SUP><A HREF="#N_48_">(48)</A></SUP>)
Even a somewhat rudimentary treatment of this problem will however bring
us a long way towards an adequate positive conception of states of affairs.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach himself is clear that <I>Sachverhalte</I>
are built up out of elements. He points out, for example, that 'states
of affairs, as these constitute themselves in assertion, cannot be simply
stuck together, as it were, out of arbitrary elements: they are rather
subject to definite laws of constitution.' (367/111) It would be wrong,
however, to infer from passages such as this that Reinach himself identifies
the elements in question with objects in the real world. For it seems that
if <I>Sachverhalte</I> were to have real parts, then they would inherit
from these parts the character of existing in time (or at least of possessing
a history), and this is incompatible with Reinach's Platonism. Reinachian
<I>Sachverhaltselemente</I>
are peculiar categorial counterparts of objects in the world.<SUP><A HREF="#N_49_">(49)</A></SUP>
Having unburdened ourselves of this Platonistic side of Reinach's philosophy,
however, there is nothing standing in the way of our conceiving <I>Sachverhaltselemente</I>
as objects existing in reality, and of working out the implications, within
this more modest framework, of the idea that in a <I>Sachverhalt</I> objects
are not merely linked together but also 'comprehended' [<I>aufgefasst</I>]
in some special way.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">14. How are Objects bound together in
a <I>Sachverhalt</I>?</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To answer this question we must first of
all consider in more detail the relation between <I>Sachverhalte</I> and
corresponding assertions. It is possible to distinguish two broad positions
in this regard. The one sees <I>Sachverhalte</I> as dependent on assertions,
awarding priority to the logical (or logico- grammatical) structures of
the sentences used to express the latter. Logical structures are as it
were read into <I>Sachverhalte</I>, which are reduced to the status of
mere intentional correlates of acts of judgment. The other sees assertions
as in some sense - to be more closely explained - dependent on or merely
correlated with corresponding <I>Sachverhalte</I>, and therefore awards
priority to ontological, as opposed to logical, structures. This gives
rise to a view according to which the parts of the assertion (and thereby
also, derivatively, the elements of the used sentence) have different functions
corresponding to the different ways in which the elements of the correlated
state of affairs are related together.<SUP><A HREF="#N_50_">(50)</A></SUP>
Reinach's work contain perhaps the most sophisticated treatment of this
second position, and - even after abstracting from the Platonistic elements
in this work - we can learn a great deal concerning what such a position
might involve from what he has to say.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The acts of meaning which are involved
in the making of an assertion, Reinach tells us, do not 'appear side by
side, unrelated to each other - as little as do the successive experiences
of hearing the notes of a melody' (356/98). For Reinach, however, it is
the unity of the <I>Sachverhalt</I> which constrains the building up of
an act of assertion and makes possible that peculiar sort of unity which
such an act involves. Of course, this does not mean that every assertion
gains its unity from a corresponding <I>Sachverhalt</I>. Some assertions
- for example assertions in mathematics, or false or metaphorical assertions
- may correspond directly to no <I>Sachverhalte</I> at all. Rather, we
can say, the forms of unity available to us in the making of assertions
are derivative of the forms of unity manifested by the simple <I>Sachverhalte</I>
with which we come into contact in standard cases of cognitive access.
This is in part a matter of developmental psychology: we become acquainted,
in our infancy, not merely with different sorts of simple objects, but
also with different varieties of simple <I>Sachverhalte</I>, and we learn
to associate with the latter simple assertions from a relatively restricted
repertoire of canonical sentence-patterns.<SUP><A HREF="#N_51_">(51)</A></SUP>
At this stage, then, there is a direct constraining connection between
<I>Sachverhalt</I>
and utterance. Later we learn to make assertions independently of direct
experience, and even to extend the learned sentential forms in ways which
rule out the possibility of corresponding <I>Sachverhalte</I>.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is only one aspect of the contrast between
simple and derived assertions which is of interest to us here, however.
In the literature on <I>Sachverhalte</I> in the analytic tradition it has
normally been assumed</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1) that there is a division between logically
simple and logically complex assertions,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2) that this division - at least for those
assertions which are true - gives rise to an exactly corresponding division
between atomic and molecular states of affairs.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Criticisms of both these assumptions from
the realist perspective have been set forth elsewhere.<SUP><A HREF="#N_52_">(52)</A></SUP>
For our present purposes, however, it will do no harm if we assume that
expressions like 'and', 'hence' and 'not' as applied to sentences reflect
certain corresponding forms of unity in complex states of affairs. The
ogical constants do not represent. This characteristically Tractarian thesis
is expressed by Reinach as follows:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Words such as 'and', 'but', 'also',
'hence', 'not', and so on, are understood in the course of the understanding
utterance of sentences without our being able to say that they are guided
by acts of meaning objectual correlates - as are, say, the words 'Socrates'
or 'tree'. It is indubitable that when I utter one of these words understandingly
in the context of a sentence then there is something more than the utterance
itself which is involved;... but it is equally indubitable that this something
more is not a direction towards something objectual in the sense earlier
delineated. For what could this objectual something be, which would correspond
to 'also' or 'but'? (358/101.)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Words like 'and', 'hence' and 'not'
express rather certain <I>functions</I>, for example the function of <I>combining</I>
two or more states of affairs to form a single complex. (359f./101f.) To
see precisely what this involves, we need to consider the structures of
atomic states of affairs, states of affairs which correspond to assertions
expressed by sentences involving no logical constants.<SUP><A HREF="#N_53_">(53)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The first kind of unity which is manifested
by atomic <I>Sachverhalte</I>, I shall argue, is the unity of foundation
relations. If John has a headache, than that process or condition which
is John's headache stands in a single relation of one-sided foundation
to the substance which is John. If Mary kisses John, then that process
which is Mary's kissing stands in two relations of one-sided foundation,
to John and to Mary. Following through this idea in the obvious way gives
rise to a taxonomy of possible forms of atomic <I>Sachverhalte</I>, somewhat
as follows:</FONT>
<P><IMG SRC="d7.jpg" HEIGHT=268 WIDTH=598>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Diagram 7</B><SUP><A HREF="#N_54_">(54)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In a state of affairs objects fit into
one another like the links of a chain. Each atomic <I>Sachverhalt</I> is
what we might call an integral chain in the sense that the associated diagrammatic
representation is such that if any frame is removed then either (1) there
results a splitting of the diagram into disconnected pieces, or (2) the
resultant is ill-formed in the sense that it contains dependent frames
not connected to their fundamenta.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Non-atomic <I>Sachverhalte</I> can therefore
arise in one of three sorts of ways:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">I. a <I>Sachverhalt</I> may lack unity
in the sense that there are elements not connected to each other by dependence
relations, either mediate or immediate. (For example the <I>Sachverhalt</I>,
if there is one, which would make true the judgment 'John is jumping and
Mary has a migraine'.)<SUP><A HREF="#N_55_">(55)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">II. a <I>Sachverhalt</I> may possess unity
- all its elements are connected - , but it is unity of a sort which results
when two or more distinct but overlapping <I>Sachverhalte</I> are run together
into a single whole ('John is hungry and has a headache').</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">III. a <I>Sachverhalt</I> may contain 'inessential
elements', elements which can be removed without detriment to the residue.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The states of affairs in categories I.
and II. correspond to logically complex <I>Sachverhalte</I> as these are
normally understood (though the fact that there are two ontologically distinct
sorts of logical complexity is rarely recognised). Those in category III.
may be illustrated as follows (the inessential elements being marked with
an asterisk):</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Cases of the sort depicted in Diagram 8
are discussed by Reinach in some detail:</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">When the building up of a state of affairs
has once begun, this cannot be arbitrarily broken off or brought to an
end but demands the addition of definite elements, elements prescribed
by laws relating not to content but to form, quite parallel to the situation
which we encounter in the building up of a melody. We cannot, for example
in the case of a state of affairs which has begun with 'the rose is', arbitrarily
break off at this point; some element or other, perhaps of the form of
a [predicate] must join up to complete it, and that element is, to that
extent, a necessary element of the state of affairs.... In the judgment
'the car has travelled quickly', in contrast, the 'quickly' is not a necessary
element but rather one which is inessential to the formal constitution
of the state of affairs. (367/111)<SUP><A HREF="#N_56_">(56)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our taxonomy of atomic and non-atomic <I>Sachverhalte</I>
in terms of foundation relations between objects does not go far enough,
however, to provide a positive account of the specific nature of the <I>Sachverhalt</I>.
For each of the forms depicted could serve equally well as a representation
of a corresponding complex <I>object</I>: the mereological sum (if there
is one) of John and his headache, or of Mary, John, and a particular process
of kissing. Indeed, someone like Reinach who admits also one-membered <I>Sachverhalte</I>,

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can get some idea as to what this additional
feature might be if we compare the elements of the Sachverhalt: John hits
Mary in Diagram 6, with the corresponding elements of the sentence used
to make the assertion in question. The objects (John, Mary and the hit)
are homogeneous: each is entirely singular. On the side of the assertion,
however, there is in this respect a heterogeneity as between the singular
expressions 'John' and 'Mary' and the general expression 'hits'. Could
this heterogeneity be eliminated? That is, could we imagine the 'hits'
as being replaced by an expression in the same grammatical category which
has been somehow stripped of its generality - an expression which would
relate to that individual event which is John's specific hit in just the
way that the proper names 'John' and 'Mary' relate to their respective
bearers? Could we not baptise this event by means of what we might call
a proper verb (an expression which would stand to normal verbs in the way
that proper names stand to expressions like 'a man', 'the man', etc.)?
This would result in sentences like 'David Gustaved', 'John Williamed Mary'
and so on,<SUP><A HREF="#N_59_">(59)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">sentences which would be isomorphic
to the corresponding states of affairs/complexes in just the sense of the

thereof.<SUP><A HREF="#N_60_">(60)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our problem can now be restated as follows:
what is it, on the side of the Sachverhalt, which corresponds to the distinction
on the side of the assertion between 'John Williamed Mary' and 'John hit
Mary'? Consider the parallel difference between 'John is kissing Mary'
and 'a man is kissing Mary'. When I say, 'John is kissing Mary', then my
use of 'John' seems, as it were, to refer to the whole man, to that entire
specific object known to me as John. When, on the other hand, I say 'a
man is kissing Mary', then it seems that I refer to John, if at all, only
as a representative of the species man: it is as if I make appeal only
to some sort of conceptually restricted torso of John, in which everything
specific has been removed.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach himself offers a partial account
of such 'conceptual comprehension' in his paper "Die obersten Regeln der
Vernunftschl&uuml;sse bei Kant" of 1911, from which I shall quote at length.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">He considers first the difference between
the objectual correlate of a proper name such as 'John' taken alone and
of a proper name which is associated with a concept-expression, as in 'the
man John', 'the man Caius', etc.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the judgment 'Caius is mortal',
a quite determinate individual object of the real world is intended by
the subject-term, one that is different from all other objects. If I now
say: 'the man Caius is mortal', then I intend once more the same determinate
object. This time however I do not aim towards it in the way appropriate
to a simple naming [in schlichter Namennennung]; rather, it is in addition
conceptually comprehended [begrifflich gefasst]: it is referred to as a
man. Thus already in the subject place there is a concept at work. It is
not as if this concept were itself the subject. The assertion is after
all not about it, but about the individual that is comprended under it
[welches er unter sich begreift]. But this individual is already posited
in the subject place as belonging to this concept; it comes complete with
its conceptual form: 'the - man - Caius is etc.'... The object serving
as subject, which is already determined in itself, is here in addition
subordinated to a concept. (p.224f./GS, 47)<SUP><A HREF="#N_61_">(61)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We might describe conceptual comprehending
of the sort here at issue as a sui generis variety of drawing boundaries.
The entities circumscribed by such boundaries are on the one hand autonomous:
that region of reality through which the boundary is drawn - for example
the complex of objects and events which are involved in John's kissing
Marty - exists in and of itself, regardless of our judging activity, and
so do all its constituent regions. Such entities are also in a certain
sense however dependent on our judgments. For in the absence of the judging
activity through which the conceptual comprehending is effected, an entity
of the given sort would in no way be demarcated from its surroundings.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As we shall see, the bounded structures
which are picked out through our judging activity are quite different from
those generated by, for example, the maker of maps or of jigsaw puzzles.
For the results of these latter varieties of drawing what we might call
mereological boundaries are ontologically homogeneous with the materials
with which one starts, something which does not hold of the entities circumscribed
by the sentence-shaped boundaries involved in conceptual comprehending.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is with a (relatively indeterminate)
mereological boundary with which we have to deal when, for example, I point
out of my window and say 'that out there is my property'. But here we have
an additional feature: the comprehending in question, expressed by 'out
there', is in this case indispensable if an object is to be marked out
at all. When I point out of my window and say 'out there', then it is as
if my action takes something entirely indeterminate and, by means of a
mereological comprehension, makes out of it a (half-way) determinate object.
The conceptual comprehension expressed by 'the man' in 'the man Caius'
is clearly not indispensable in this sense: the name 'Caius' is alone sufficient
to pick out the relevant object. There are however certain cases where
conceptual comprehending is indispensable, where such comprehending is
alone responsible for the fact that an object is picked out at all. Such
cases are brought most clearly into light when we consider general or generic
assertions like 'man is mortal', 'the lion is a carnivore', etc. A concept,
according to Reinach,</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">can make out of the indeterminate
something [der Gegenst&auml;ndlichkeit schlechthin] a determinately delineated
objectivity. Such a comprehending would be made explicit by means of the
words: 'that which is (a) man or (a) tree or, and so on, is...'; and where
we choose not to be so explicit we have the words '(the) man', '(the) tree'.
If I say 'man is mortal' then the subject is that something which is comprehended
and determined through the concept man. No determinate individual object
is here intended, i.e. nothing is intended which is then conceptually comprehended
in a supernumerary way. Nor do I relate myself to a number of objects separate
from each other which I would then conceptually comprehend. Rather, I mean
the indeterminate something which falls under the concept man - and it
remains thereby quite open whether this is one or several or very many
objects. I mean precisely that which is (a) man - or, if we especially
want to emphasise that nothing is here to be excluded: that which is subordinated
to the concept man, all of that which is man. The concept does not here
effect a supernumerary comphrehending, as in our earlier example, but rather
a determination that is indispensable to the very constitution of the subject.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is not the concept which functions
as subject in the judgment 'man is mortal', but that objectual something
which is formed and delimited through the concept. It is not the concept
man which is mortal, but that which is man, i.e. that objectual something
which belongs to the concept man. As in the judgment about individual objects,
so also in judgments such as this, the concept occurring in the subject-place
has a real objectual carrier, and it is this which ought in truth to be
seen as the subject: it is merely that in the former case the carrier is
a determinate individual object, which the concept determines still further,
where here it is the indeterminate something which functions as the carrier
insofar as it acquires a determinate delineation through the concept. (226/GS,
49)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">And similarly, we can say, it is not
the concept kiss which functions as correlate of the verb in the judgment
'John kisses Mary'. Here, too, the concept expressed by this verb has a
real objectual carrier, and it is this which would serve as element in
the corresponding state of affairs.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Reinach's theory of conceptual comprehending
provides some of the elements necessary to an adequate account of the structures
of simple states of affairs. But it is far from being satisfactory as it
stands, and it does not even provide an umambiguous answer to our question
as to the part-whole relations between Sachverhalte and their objects.
For it provides us with no clear notion of what these peculiar entities
are, which result through 'conceptual comprehending'. Reinach's own account
of this matter, which involves appeal to peculiar general objects: tree
as such, man as such, etc., and to 'the indeterminate something', moves
too far in the direction of that Platonism already rejected above:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Tree as such is nothing coloured
and material and extended, it differs fundamentally from every individual
object of the external world. And yet it is not 'nothing'. Indeed there
are entirely valid statements about such peculiar objectivities, they present
their own logical demands and prohibitions: the tree is a plant, the tree
is not an animal, and so on. We therefore have to acknowledge that, beside
the individual objects of the physical and psychical world, objects with
which we are already familiar and which are, as it were, closer to us,
there are also quite differently constituted objectivities of which we
can assert all kinds of things, both positively and negatively. (221/GS,
43)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We can perhaps avoid a Platonism of
this sort, if we take as our starting point exclusively those conceptually
comprehended objects which appear in the objectual correlates of singular
judgments ('Mary has a migraine') of the sort already treated above. For
in relation to these cases it is possible to take quite literally the idea
that the conceptually comprehended object is in some sense a slimmed-down
torso of the object taken in natura. For where a concept like man, horse,
kiss, headache can correctly be applied to an individual object, this is
because there is, some autonomously but not independently existing part
or moment of the object in question to which the concept- expression directly
corresponds. It is in virtue of such parts or moments - called 'logical
parts' by Brentano and Husserl<SUP><A HREF="#N_63_">(63)</A></SUP> - that
the given concepts can correctly be applied. They serve as the fundamenta
in re for the concepts in question.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The suggestion now is that such logical
parts can serve as bounded objects of conceptual comprehension, and then
the <I>Sachverhalte</I> corresponding to singular judgments would consist
in such bounded objects linked to ordinary objects by relations of foundation.
<I>Sachverhalte</I>,
thus conceived, would be circumscribed or bounded parts of complexes, having
exactly the appropriate amount of content to serve as truth-makers of the
corresponding judgments. Yet they would exist autonomously, not as mere
intentional correlates of sentence-using acts.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even granted the assumption that such a
view of conceptual comprehension can be coherently developed, however,
is it enough to understand the ontological structure of the<I> Sachverhalt</I>
exclusively in terms of foundation relations between objects and logical
parts? Or are there additional features or groups of features peculiar
to states of affairs which have so far not been treated? Reinach himself
suggests two such features: number and tense. In regard to the former it
must suffice here to draw attention to Reinach's suggestion that it would
be possible to replace Frege's defective concept-based theory of number
with a <I>Sachverhalt</I>-based theory, to see numbers as formations which
are at home only within the context of a <I>Sachverhalt</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#N_64_">(64)</A></SUP>
In regard to the latter, we shall here simply recall the idea already mentioned
to the effect that <I>Sachverhalte</I> are the locus of past and future.
A more subtle version of this idea has been put forward by Kevin Mulligan
in the form of a thesis to the effect that we can establish a feature truly
characteristic of states of affairs if we look not to tense, which has
to do with relations between autonomous events and sentence-using subjects,
but to phenomena of aspect, which have to do with the 'internal temporal
constituency' of the events themselves (Comry 1976).</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Differences of aspect are manifested, for
example, in oppositions such as that between 'John ran'/'John was running'/'John
stopped running', 'Mary suddenly sat down'/?'Mary was suddenly sitting
down'/'Mary was still sitting down'/*'Mary still sat down', etc. Thus consider
that factual material which is John kissing Mary on a given occasion. This
consists, we might suppose, of three objects: John, Mary and a certain
temporally extended process of kissing. We have already seen that this
factual material can be comprehended in Sachverhalte in different ways,
reflecting different sorts of conceptual comprehension. But the same factual
material can be variously comprehended also along another dimension, the
dimension of aspect, and it will thereby make true a series of different
sentences (sentences which we can conceive as having been articulated by
different observers all of whom enjoy simultaneous perceptual access to
the objects in question). This factual material can be comprehended, for
example, as:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">John is kissing Mary,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">John kisses Mary,<SUP><A HREF="#N_65_">(65)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">John has just begun to kiss Mary,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">John is still kissing Mary,</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">John is repeatedly kissing Mary,</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">and so on.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The differences here illustrated are real:
the states of affairs in question are not identical. Yet these differences
seem not to correspond, in the given case, to any differences of conceptual
comprehension, nor to differences in the objects themselves.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">16. Epilogue: Reinach and Wittgenstein</FONT></B>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">There are of course a number of features
of Reinach's theory of the Sachverhalt which awaken echoes of the theory
put forward by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus. Both Wittgenstein and Reinach
see the name-object relation as the point of contact between a judger and
the world. Both place the notion of state of affairs at the centre of their
philosophies, and both conceive the state of affairs not as an abstract
proposition or judgment-content but rather as the ontological correlate
of an act of judgment, as that in the world in virtue of which a used sentence
is true or false. Reinach and Wittgenstein share also the recognition that
there are, above the level of states of affairs, two further levels - a
linguistic level, and a psychological level of thoughts or acts of judgment.
Of course, Wittgenstein goes considerably further than Reinach in exploiting
the theory of Sachverhalte as a means of throwing light on the logical
structures of associated sentences. But I suggest that this is only at
the cost of ontological simplification, or idealisation, at all three levels,
simplification of a sort which is absent from Reinach's treatment.</FONT>

Again, neither Husserl nor Reinach applied the theory of dependence to
the relations between acts and objects. The relational theory of acts which
is here grafted onto their work is elaborated further in Smith 1984 and
also in Mulligan and Smith (forthcoming). Further, there is more involved
in Reinach's account of the opposition between <I>Meinen</I> and <I>Vorstellen</I>
than is captured in Diagrams 1 and 2 (diagrams which, it must be remembered,
depict only relations between <I>real</I> things, processes or events).
This is because for Reinach the contrast between punctual, linguistic <I>Meinen</I>
and enduring, non-linguistic <I>Vorstellen</I> is absolutely general; the
two kinds of directedness can be distinguished not merely in our cognitive
access to <I>realia</I> but also, for example, in our access to non-real
objects such as numbers and values (see e.g. 343/88).</FONT></FONT>

Rechtes". See, for example, pp.170ff. (Eng. 5ff.), where Reinach speaks
on the one hand of a 'new realm' of 'legal formations' governed by 'eternal
laws', but on the other hand of 'particular legal formations which really
exist at some time'.</FONT></FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_35_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>35. When
Reinach talks of apprehension ['<I>Erkennen</I>'], he sometimes seems to
conceive this phenomenon - in conformity with his Platonistic conception
of states of affairs - as a special sort of intuition. Since nothing in
our present account will rest on any appeal to this Platonistic side of
Reinach's philosophy, however, it will do no harm if we simply identify
apprehension with perfectly commonplace acts of <I>seeing that </I>(and
of course with corresponding phenomena in other sensory modalities). Cf.
the passage quoted at the beginning of the next section.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_36_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>36. The
term 'attitude' is used by Ryle to describe phenomena such as belief, doubt,
etc., in his copious notes to Reinach's essay (preserved in the margins
of his copy of the <I>Gesammelte Schriften</I> in the library of Lineacre
College, Oxford: cf. p.75). One unfortunate characteristic of analytic
philosophical inquiries in semantics and cognitive theory, from Russell
onwards, is the tendency to run together under this term phenomena which,
in Reinach's theory, are kept carefully separate.</FONT></FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_38_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>38. Again
Reinach's Platonism, as well as the fact that he does not embrace anything
stronger than mere co-existence between act and object, rules out for him
a view of this sort.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_39_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>39. The
reader will note that assertion, conviction, apprehension and presentation
are such that - in addition to the unity which accrues to them by virtue
of inhering in a single subject - they are united also by foundation relations
in their own right. The subject as guarantor of the unity of consciousness
is to this extent redundant, and indeed the views here presented would
be compatible, in principle, with a no-self theory of mental acts and processes
of the sort that is defended by the early Husserl and by Wittgenstein.
To be taken seriously, however, such a theory would have to establish that
an extra unifying principle such as a soul or subject can be dispensed
with entirely, by providing a precise and detailed account of the foundation
relations holding between mental acts and states of the various different
varieties and between these and (for example) bodily actions.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_40_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>40. This
assumption may of course be dropped in specific cases (or indeed globally,
in reflection of non-standard metaphysical views).</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_41_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>41. If
as a matter of empirical fact an instance of the kind <I>assertion</I>
exists, then as a matter of necessity there exist also instances of the
kinds <I>conscious subject, state of conviction</I> and <I>state of affairs</I>.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_42_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>42. Convictions
will of course be founded also on a network of other, prior mental acts
and states, though this aspect of cognition is here left out of account.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_43_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>43. Note
that our talk of non-subsisting states of affairs is a <I>fa&ccedil;on
de parler</I> only; it has no ontological commitments. Thus the putative
non-subsisting state of affairs S is not depicted in our diagram: the elements
of such diagrams are intended in every case to correspond to existing entities
only.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_44_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>44. Still
further cases would have to be distinguished in light of the fact that
the two incompatible states of affairs involved in such a structure need
not be contradictory oppositesd, as they are in the examples which Reinach
treats. There is no less incompatibility between, for example, <I>Henry
is a mammal</I> and <I>Henry is a fish</I>. Compare the discussion in Mulligan,
Simons and Smith 1984 on the way in which states of affairs (or truth-makers
in general) may include each other as part to whole, and the suggestion
in Smith 1983 as to the possibility of isolating a <I>minimal </I>truth-maker.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_45_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>45. Brentano
even went so far as to claim that judgment and presentation must be simultaneous:

<P><A NAME="N_50_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>50. The
overwhelming majority of analytic philosophical writings in semantics,
to the extent that it has embraced the terminology of 'facts' or '<I>Sachverhalte</I>'
at all, has adopted the first of these two positions - normally conceiving
that in virtue of which a given judgment is true in terms of set-theoretical
'models' whose relation to the underlying objects is rarely, if ever, investigated.
Wittgenstein's <I>Tractatus</I> may be said to have put forward a neutral
view, midway between the two extremes, according to which neither <I>Satz</I>
nor <I>Sachverhalt</I> has priority, though the resulting simplification
implies that neither logical nor ontological structure is commensurately
dealt with. (Cf. Mulligan 1985, 169f.) Recent American work in semantics,
as illustrated above all by the so-called 'situation semantics' of Barwise
and Perry, has moved some way towards the second, realist position here
described, though since it continues to treat the external correlates of
sentences or judgments with ontologically relatively crude set-theoretic
means, it cannot be said to have freed itself entirely from the logicising
tendencies of the old- fashioned sort of semantics.</FONT></FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_52_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>52. See
Mulligan, Simons and Smith 1984, where the discussion of logical and ontological
simplicity is formulated not specifically in terms of <I>Sachverhalte </I>but
in terms of truth-making entities in general.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_53_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>53. These
structures have hardly been investigated. Even Ingarden's huge work on
realist ontology, <I>Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt</I>, concentrates
on the distinctions between different sorts of <I>Sachverhalte</I> (e.g.
between autonomous and intentional <I>Sachverhalte</I>), at the expense
of providing an account of how <I>Sachverhalte</I> are constituted in the
most simple cases.</FONT></FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_54_"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=-1>54. The
problem of extending this taxonomy in a systematic way, and in such a way
as to embrace arbitrarily large complexes of elements standing to each
other in 3-, 4- and n-sided dependence relations, belongs effectively to
the theory of directed graphs.</FONT></FONT>

is some confusion in this passage as between <I>Sachverhalt</I> and judgment.
More specifically, Reinach seems to have no clear idea as to the relation
between the state of affairs as correlate of apprehension and the state
of affairs as correlate of assertion. On the one hand these 'must be <I>strictly
identical</I>' (320/62), but on the other hand he admits that in an assertion
the very same state of affairs</FONT></FONT>

In his <I>Notebooks</I> of 1914-16, Wittgenstein goes out of his way to
emphasise that <I>Sachverhalte</I> or <I>Tatsachen</I> are to be distinguished
from corresponding complex objects - see Simons 1985, Mulligan 1985. In
the <I>Tractatus</I>, however, it is less obvious that he was concerned
to draw such a distinction.</FONT></FONT>

Such sentences sound odd, since it is normally only continuants, not events
and processes, to which proper referring expressions come to be attached.
For it is only in respect of continuants that there is a task of re-location
to be performed.</FONT></FONT>
