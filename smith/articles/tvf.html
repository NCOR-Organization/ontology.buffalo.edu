<P><B>Abstract</B>
<BR>The paper uses the tools of mereotopology (the theory of parts, wholes
and boundaries) to work out the implications of certain analogies between
the 'ecological psychology' of J. J Gibson and the phenomenology of Edmund
Husserl. It presents an ontological theory of spatial boundaries and of
spatially extended entities. By reference to examples from the geographical
sphere it is shown that both boundaries and extended entities fall into
two broad categories: those which exist independently of our cognitive
acts (for example, the planet Earth, its exterior surface); and those which
exist only in virtue of such acts (for example: the equator, the North
Sea). The visual field, too, can be conceived as an example of an extended
entity that is dependent in the sense at issue. The paper suggests extending
this analogy by postulating entities which would stand to true judgments
as the visual field stands to acts of visual perception. The <I>judgment
field</I> is defined more precisely as that complex extended entity which
comprehends all entities which are relevant to the truth of a given (true)
judgment. The work of cognitive linguists such as Talmy and Langacker,
when properly interpreted, can be shown to yield a detailed account of
the structures of the judgment fields corresponding to sentences of different
sorts. A new sort of correspondence-theoretic definition of truth for sentences
of natural language can then be formulated on this basis.

<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>0. Preamble: Gibson and Phenomenology</B>
<BR>The paper which follows is part of a larger project designed to exploit
the ecological psychology of J. J. Gibson to yield a new, realist interpretation
of Husserlian phenomenology. The world, as J. J. Gibson points out, is
a complex hierarchy of inter-nested levels: molecules are nested within
cells, cells are nested within leaves, leaves are nested within trees,
trees are nested within forests. (Gibson 1986, p. 101) Each type of organism
is tuned in its behavior to entities on a specific level of granularity
within this complex hierarchy, to entities which together form what Gibson
calls an 'ecological niche'. A niche is that into which an animal <I>fits</I>
; it is that in relation to which the animal is habituated in its behavior.
(Gibson 1986, p. 129) A niche embraces not only objects of different sorts,
but also shapes, colours, textures, tendencies, boundaries (surfaces, edges),
all of which are organized in such a way as to enjoy affordance-character
for the animal in question. Thus the given features motivate the organism;
they are such as to intrude upon its life, to stimulate the organism in
a wide range of different though characteristically understandable and
familiar ways. The niche shared by all human beings - called by Husserl
the 'life world' - is thus such that its basic organizing features are
intrinsically comprehensible to the human organism (amounting to what Husserl
calls the '<I>a priori </I>of the life world'). These basic organizing
features include simple geometrical and topological relations, relations
of identity, part and whole, as well as relations between qualities of
different sorts.
<P>Gibson's idea is one according to which we human beings are integrated
into the world order via our perceptions and actions in virtue of the fact
that these perceptions and actions are <I>pre-tuned </I>to the characteristic
shapes and qualities and patterns of behavior of our respective environments.
In the case of human beings this mutual embranglement is extended further
via cultural phenomena, above all via language and its associated institutions.
To learn a language is in part also to extend the range of objects in relation
to which we are spontaneously to adjust our behaviour. Just as our experiences
of objects of perception in the common-sense world are characteristically
and for the most part not subject to deliberation, so also our experience
of the words of a language which we thoroughly understand is spontaneously
bound together completely with our grasping of the associated meanings
and thereby also with our being spontaneously directed towards corresponding
objects in the world.
<P>The concept of niche can be extended and generalized beyond the basic
level of the life world of common sense also in other ways. A humanly extended
niche might include, for example, the interior of a cockpit, the floor
of a stock exchange or the environment of a keyboard and computer-screen;
it might include a library or a highway system, or it might include the
world of a scientific theory or of some other specialist activity (for
example of measuring or legislating) in which a human being feels himself
at home. For as Gibson himself intimated, and as Husserl argued in detail
in the second book of his <I>Ideas </I>(Husserliana IV; see also the extremely
provocative Katz 1987), the activity of scientific theorizing on the part
of different specialist sciences can be compared in important respects
to the behavior of animals and humans in their respective natural environments.
There is a deep-rooted analogy between the relationship of animal or human
behavior to niche or life world on the one hand, and the relationship of
scientist (or of specialist community of scientists) to the corresponding
scientific subject-matter on the other.
<P>The basic axiom of Husserl's constitutive phenomenology is this: that
<I>all
objects refer back to corresponding acts in which they are (or can be)
given</I>. All entities, on whatever level, are correlates of corresponding
acts, and each subject is directed in its acts towards a corresponding
world of correlates: 'As person I am what I am (and each other person is
what he is) as <I>subject of a surrounding world</I>. The concepts of ego
and surrounding world are related to one another inseparably.' (Husserliana
IV, p. 185.) The world of common sense is an accomplishment of a community
of persons recognizing each other (or better: taking each other for granted)
as in agreement. The things of the common-sense world are direct correlates
not of abstract, theoretical experiences, but of <I>intuitive</I> experiences;
they are 'things we see, grasp, and touch, just as we, and other people,
see them, grasp them, etc.' (Husserliana IV, p. 287; see also Smith 1995a)
<P>From the basic axiom it follows that physical things, too, can be nothing
other than the correlates of certain acts, namely of the theoretical acts
of physicists. Physical nature is then itself the common 'surrounding world'
of physicists, precisely as they know of it in their theories and conceived
as extended <I>in infinitum</I> and in perfect regularity. Other such special
'surrounding worlds' can be distinguished also. Thus for example there
are the worlds of mathematical or legal objects, of financial instruments,
chess, and so on. Each such realm of objects is an interpersonal, cultural
accomplishment, presupposing a certain association of human beings.
<P>The Gibsonian perspective has obvious implications for our understanding
of the phenomenological theories of the life world (or of <I>'Umwelt'</I>
or 'bodily space') put forward by Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty
in their various writings. This same perspective yields also, however,
a radically new, realist interpretation of Husserl's 'constitutive phenomenology':
constitution is not, from the Gibsonian point of view, the <I>creation</I>
of a new domain of entities in some spurious 'transcendent' realm: rather,
it is the carving out of a new sort of niche from within the already existing
surrounding world of the relevant subject or specialist community.
<P>The Gibsonian perspective has implications also for our understanding
of the relation of individual acts to their corresponding objective correlates.
Thus consider once again the analogy between the relationship of human
behavior to niche on the one hand, and the relationship of the specialist
community of scientists to its corresponding scientific subject-matter
on the other. This same analogy can be applied not merely to global behaviour-patterns
but also to specific acts: an act of visual perception stands to a visual
field as an act of (true) judgment stands to a fact or state of affairs.
The bulk of the present paper will be devoted to the working out of some
of the implications of this latter analogy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>1. Types of Boundaries</B>
<BR>We most commonly demarcate reality along what we might call <I>natural
</I>or
<I>bona fide boundaries</I>. The most prominent (and most salient) examples
of such natural boundaries are the outer boundaries of objects and processes
in space and in time respectively. Such natural boundaries are boundaries
<I>in the things themselves. </I>They would exist even in the absence of
all articulating activity on our part. The natural boundary of you is (roughly
speaking) the surface of your skin.
<P>We can recognize also <I>internal</I> natural boundaries - for example
the boundaries around your heart, lungs, and other organs. But we can recognize
also <I>unnatural</I> boundaries, which is to say boundaries, both internal
and external, which correspond to no genuine heterogeneity (natural articulations)
on the side of the bounded entities themselves. The equator, for example,
like the boundary of Utah, corresponds to no local physical discontinuity,
and to no qualitative heterogeneity (of material constitution, colour,
texture, etc.) in the world itself.
<P>Let us call inner and outer boundaries of this second sort <I>fiat</I>
boundaries, a terminology that is designed to draw attention to the sense
in which the latter owe their existence to acts of human decision or fiat
or to cognitive phenomena of associated sorts. The plausibility of extending
our ontology by acknowledging fiat boundaries in this way lies first of
all in the fact that all of the standard distinctions which we can make
between types of natural boundaries can be straightforwardly applied also
to their fiat counterparts. Thus we can distinguish between natural and
fiat boundaries of different numbers of dimensions: the equator, like the
edge of this table, is a one-dimensional boundary; the North Pole, like
the corner of this table, is a zero-dimensional boundary. We can distinguish
between natural and fiat boundaries which are complete and incomplete:
the Western Front (<I>anno</I> 1916), and the boundary between France and
Germany, are examples of incomplete fiat boundaries, in the sense that
they do not of themselves serve to demarcate any object in the way in which
this is done, for example, by the equator (which demarcates the two hemispherical
surfaces of the Earth) and by the boundary of my body (which demarcates
the corporeal me). We can similarly distinguish between natural and fiat
boundaries which are enduring and transient: the Western Front, again,
is an example of a transient fiat boundary, the boundary of Iceland (modulo
the movement of tides) is an example of a (relatively) enduring fiat boundary,
and the boundaries of this cloud and of that stone are transient and enduring
natural boundaries, respectively. We can distinguish equally between crisp
and fuzzy natural and fiat boundaries: the equator is crisp and the product
of fiat; the boundary of this cone of light is crisp but exists as part
of the natural world; the boundary of Asia is fuzzy but it is still (we
can suppose) a product of fiat, the boundary of the polar ice-cap is likewise
fuzzy but a product of nature. Deserts, valleys, dunes, etc. are delineated
not by crisp outer boundaries but rather by boundary-like regions which
are to some degree indeterminate (Cohn and Gotts 1994, Freksa and Barkowsky,
1995). Most peninsular objects (including fingers, hands, arms) are characterized
likewise by the possession of indeterminate boundaries in the area where
they abut their larger hosts. (We leave to one side here the question whether,
as quantum physics seems to suggest, there is an additional type of boundary-indeterminacy
that pertains to all material objects given in our normal experience.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>2. Fiat Objects</B>
<BR>Once fiat boundaries have been recognized, then it becomes clear that
the <I>bona fide</I>-fiat opposition can be drawn in relation to <I>objects</I>
also (Smith 1994). Fiat objects are those objects which exist only in virtue
of the fact that some corresponding (complete) fiat boundary has come to
be drawn. Examples of genuine objects are: you and me, the planet earth.
Examples of fiat objects are: all geographical entities - Dade County,
Florida, the United States, the Northern Hemisphere - demarcated in ways
which do not, or do not everywhere, respect qualitative differentiations
or spatio-temporal discontinuities in the underlying territory. And then,
not the least important reason for admitting fiat objects into our general
ontology turns on the fact that <I>most of us live in one</I> (or in what
turns out to be a nested hierarchy of such objects).
<P>Clearly most geographical fiat objects will have boundaries which involve
a combination of <I>bona fide</I> and fiat elements: the shores of the
North Sea are <I>bone fide</I> boundaries, not, however, its boundaries
at those points where it abuts the Atlantic. The Western Front is built
out of <I>bona fide</I> stretches, where opposing armies are faced off
against each other in more or less linear fashion, knitted together by
interspersed fiat stretches, generated algorithmically, by joining up the
dots (roughly: a front line is the shortest distance between two neighbouring
but separated infantry companies). We might in light of this example distinguish
between
<P>1. fiat boundaries, every portion of which is laid down by explicit
human fiat (for example by drawing lines on a map);
<P>2. fiat boundaries stretches of which are determined in whole or in
part in relation to natural boundaries (or to pre-existing fiat boundaries)
on the basis of geometrical algorithms (most determinations effected by
boundary commissions are of this sort, for example when a boundary is specified
as lying in the middle of a river bed);
<P>3. fiat boundaries determined algorithmically not in relation to boundaries
but in relation to other real properties of the underlying subject-matter:
the boundaries depicted in dialect and electoral atlases are of this sort,
as are the transient boundaries depicted in weather maps.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>3. Fiat Boundaries as Created Entities</B>
<BR>What begins as a fiat geographical boundary may evolve over time into
a natural boundary, marking not merely new features of the landscape but
also differences in the language or dialect or trading habits of those
who live on either side - all of which suggests that we develop a view
of geographical boundaries as created entities, entities subject to the
vagaries of history. Thus fiat boundaries seem to have a beginning in time,
and geographical boundaries in general are such as to instantiate one of
a number of characteristic patterns of boundary evolution. (Prescott 1978)
<P>Against this, however, is an alternative view according to which spatial
boundaries are merely abstract mathematical constructions and are thus
not the sorts of things which can be subject to historical change. Boundaries
are not created, on the given view, but discovered or picked out from the
infinite totality of all geometrically possible alternative ways of dividing
up (say) the surface of the earth. Utah, on the given reading, existed
long before its boundaries were first picked out by the correspondingly
responsible administrators, and it may similarly continue to exist for
long after man has ceased to occupy this planet.
<P>Are fiat boundaries, and the fiat objects they circumclude, <I>discovered</I>
or <I>created</I>? The former view has in its favour the virtue of ontological
parsimony: only one sort of boundary needs to be admitted into our ontology,
where on the latter view we should have to admit in addition to purely
geometrical boundaries also certain historically determined boundaries
which coincide with these. An argument in favour of the existence of historically
created boundaries can however be formulated as follows. We note, first
of all, that 'Hamburg' is an ambiguous term, standing on the one hand for
a certain city (Hamburg-Stadt) and on the other hand for a certain administrative
entity (Hamburg-Land), which is one of the constituent <I>L&auml;nder</I>
(states, cantons), of the German Federal Republic. Hamburg-Stadt and Hamburg-Land
are distinct entities, which happen to coincide spatially. On the geometrical
account of boundaries (boundaries are discovered, not created) Hamburg-Stadt
and Hamburg-Land have <I>identical</I> boundaries; on the alternative,
historical reading, they have boundaries which are distinct from each other
and from the underlying geometrical boundaries, even though all three sets
of boundaries are such as to coincide spatially. Why on earth, now, should
we not embrace the more parsimonious reading and save ourselves the embarrassment
of, in this case, three complete sets of boundaries in the very same place?
The answer to this question turns on the possibility of divergent histories.
The boundary of Hamburg-Stadt might, after all, have lain elsewhere. Each
geometrically determined boundary is however as a matter of necessity exactly
where it is. If, therefore, the boundary <I>b</I> of Hamburg-Stadt were
<I>identical
to </I>(and not merely contingently such as to coincide with) a certain
geometrical boundary, then we should have to swallow the simultaneous truth
of
<P>(1) <I>b </I>could have lain elsewhere
<P>and
<P>(2) <I>b</I> is as a matter of necessity exactly where it is.
<P>One must reject the temptation to suppose that we are confronted here
with a mere verbal dispute, which could be resolved by some alternative
choice of words. For consider the in many ways analogous case of Bremen.
'Bremen', too, is ambiguous; it refers on the one hand to a certain city,
and on the other to a certain <I>Land</I>. In this case however the boundaries
of Bremen-Stadt and -Land are not such as to coincide. And of course something
analogous might hold in the case of Hamburg, too: it would be an administrative
act of no great difficulty to bring it about that, as of tomorrow, the
boundaries of Hamburg-Stadt and -Land should likewise be distinct or be,
in however subtle a fashion, differently defined. This implies, however,
that already today we are dealing with entities which could have distinct
histories, and this is possible only if the entities themselves are already
distinct.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>4. Fiat Objects in Perception</B>
<BR>Geographical boundaries such as those of Hamburg-Stadt and -Land are,
if the argument above can be accepted, human creations that are subject
to the vagaries of history. It is as if, through the evolution of our political
and administrative and legal practices and through practices relating to
property law, new boundaries come to be inscribed in reality in addition
to the natural boundaries in relation to which these supernumerary fiat
boundaries are constructed and in terms of which they are defined. As will
already have become clear from some of the examples mentioned above, however,
we are confronted in our everyday experience also with a great wealth of
such supernumerary boundaries of a more transient sort, boundaries created
by our acts of perception and by human cognitive processes of other sorts.
Imagine, for example, that I am outdoors on a clear day looking out over
the landscape. One prominent object in the visual field hereby determined
is my present <I>horizon</I>, a transient and incomplete and roughly linear
boundary between earth and sky, whose existence and nature are determined
not by any simple act of decision or fiat on my part but by my very existence
as a visually perceiving subject in a given location at a given time, as
also by the perimetric properties of my visual system, by topographical
features of the location, and by the laws of optics. Note, however, that
even in this case there is a residual element of human decision at work,
namely the decision on my part to turn my head in a given direction at
a given moment.
<P>The horizon is a component object of the visual field, and the latter
may be defined, with Ewald Hering, "as the totality of real objects imaged
at a given moment on the retina of the right or left eye." (1964, p. 226)
Let us assume that the eye sees in normal fashion, thus that it is not
momentarily startled and that there are no tricks, mirrors or special equipment,
and no clouds, fog, stained glass, and the like, in its way of seeing given
objects. The depictions of the visual field provided by Mach (1959, p.
19: see the figure below) and by Gibson (1979, pp. 118f.) tell us that
the objects making up the visual field according to Hering's definition
are primarily the <I>surfaces</I> of three-dimensional substances (the
surfaces of walls, trousers, book-ends, etc.). In fact we can distinguish
three sorts of component:
<P>- two-dimensional surfaces (with their own intrinsic curvature in three-dimensional
space);
<P>- the boundaries of these two-dimensional surfaces (both one-dimensional
edges and zero-dimensional vertices; both fiat and natural boundaries:
the horizon is an example of a one-dimensional fiat boundary in the interior
of the visual field);
<P>- the one-dimensional psychologically induced fiat outer boundary of
the visual field itself.
<P>The boundary of the visual field is a complex, subtle, ever-changing
and gappy patchwork of physical surfaces and other components. The patchwork
is 'open', topologically speaking: its external boundary is not a part
of the visual field itself (as death is not an event in life). The patchwork
is organised further in terms of an opposition between (i) entities ('figures')
in the focus of attention, entities characteristically manifesting determinate
boundaries, and (ii) entities which have indeterminate boundaries and which
are experienced as running on (as 'ground') behind them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>5. Language-Generated Fiat Objects</B>
<BR>A further important class of transient fiat boundaries are those effected
through our everyday use of natural language. As Talmy puts it, drawing
attention to a hitherto insufficiently studied analogy between the articulations
effected by descriptive uses of language and those effected by acts of
visual perception:
<P>Linguistic forms can direct the distribution of one's attention over
a referent scene in a certain type of pattern, the placement of one or
more windows of greatest attention over the scene, in a process that can
be termed the windowing of attention. (Forthcoming, MS p. 2)
<P>Common to all such processes is the determination of a boundary, which
might be a sharp line or a gradient zone, and whose particular scope and
contour - hence, the particular quantity and portions of material that
it encloses - can be seen to vary from context to context.
<P>The characteristics of such boundaries include:
<P>First … the material enclosed within the boundary is felt to constitute
a unitary coherent conceptual entity distinct from the material outside
the boundary. Second, there seems to be some sense of <I>connectivity </I>throughout
the material enclosed within the boundary and, contrariwise, some sense
of <I>discontinuity</I> or <I>disjuncture</I> across the boundary between
the enclosed and external material. … Third, the various portions of the
material within the boundary are felt to be <I>co-relevant</I> to each
other, whereas the material outside the boundary is not relevant to that
within. (<I>Op. cit., </I>pp. 4f.)
<P>As Talmy and Langacker have shown in great detail, and as the phenomenologist
Johannes Daubert emphasized in the 'delineationist' ontology of states
of affairs which he developed in the early years of this century (Schuhmann
and Smith 1987), the very same material can be subject to such windowing
or profiling in different ways, amounting, in our terms, to the inscription
within one and the same whole of internal fiat boundary-structures of different
sorts. Thus to take one very simple example, the very same totality of
objects and processes is windowed in different ways by 'Blood flowed from
his nose' and 'He was bleeding from the nose.'
<P>The thesis that the windowing effected through a complete linguistic
act is a matter of the drawing of a topologically complete fiat boundary
around a given portion of worldly material then allows us to develop a
sort of topological grammar, a grammar that exploits the formal tools of
the topologist (more precisely: of the mereotopologist; see the papers
collected in Eschenbach, <I>et al.</I> and Varzi 1994), in giving an account
of the ways in which, through uses of language, we effect systematically
different sorts of windowing or profiling of reality (or fail in the attempt).
Thus for example we can associate different sorts of incomplete or syncategorematic
expressions ('John caused', 'John closed', 'John ----- quickly ....' and
so on) with different sorts of incompleteness on the side of the corresponding
fiat boundaries. There are then incomplete boundaries, analogous to the
geographical cases of incompleteness referred to above, also in the linguistic
sphere.
<P>A further type of articulation, dual to the addition of fiat boundaries
within the interiors of objects, arises where <I>bona fide </I>interior
part-structure is as it were stripped away, for example where an extended
entity with genuine interior boundaries is treated as if it were a homogeneous
whole. One variety of this phenomenon in the linguistic sphere might be
called <I>fiat continuity, </I>which occurs where natural language sanctions
the use of mass terms ('water', 'sugar', 'luggage') to refer to entities
which are in fact made up of discrete units in such a way that they come
to be treated as continuous. It is here that we encounter the granularity
that is characteristic of all phenomena of natural cognition: only those
extended parts of objects and processes which enjoy a certain minimal extent
come to be counted as parts within natural language fiat articulations.
(See Ojeda 1993, Habel 1994.)
<P>There is one important difference between the views of Daubert on the
windowing of language, and those of Talmy and Langacker, however. Daubert
very clearly saw the boundaries in question - by analogy with the geographical
case - as boundaries in reality, albeit boundaries generated by human fiat.
Talmy and Langacker, in contrast, with their talk of 'conceptual boundaries',
of 'boundaries in conceptual reality', of boundaries in 'our concept of
reality', and so on, seem unclear as to whether language-induced boundaries
would be drawn within the mind or in exterior reality or in some other
not clearly specified 'conceptual realm'. The motivation for this unclarity
is understandable: it derives from the desire to develop a theory of linguistic
usage which would apply equally to all the myriad different sorts of objects
to which our sentences relate. Thus as Langacker points out:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>we are capable of constructing conceptual worlds of arbitrary
complexity involving entities and phenomena that have no direct counterpart
in peripherally connected experience. Such are the worlds of dreams, stories,
mythology, mathematics, predictions about the future, flights of the imagination,
and linguistic theories. All of us have constructed many conceptual worlds
that differ in genre, complexity, conventionality, abstractness, degree
of entrenchment, and so on. For many linguistic purposes all of these worlds
are on a par with the one we distinguish as "reality". (1987/1991, I, p.
113)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Note, however, that these worlds are not on a par with respect to what
some might argue is the most important of all linguistic purposes, namely
that of giving an account of how, through language, human beings are able
to become related to peripherally connected reality at all. Note, further,
that if reality (or what Langacker calls '"reality"') is regarded as a
mere constructed world, then one runs the risk of flouting our normal distinction
between objects and concepts (for example between rabbits and our concepts
of rabbits), with much confusion as its consequence:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person's conception of reality is itself a conceptual world
that is built up from peripherally connected experience through complex
sequences of mental operations. We construct our conception of the "real
world" bit by bit, stage by stage, from myriad and multifarious sensory
and motor experiences. ... It is our conception of reality (not the real
world per se) that is relevant to linguistic semantics. (1987/1991, I,
p. 114)</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the eyes of the cognitive linguist, it would seem, our natural language
sentences about rabbits are not about rabbits (per se) at all; rather they
are about conceptual rabbits which we ourselves have constructed bit by
bit. (!) The whole thrust of cognitive grammar &agrave; la Talmy and Langacker
is unfortunately to minimize in this fashion the ontologically crucial
differences between human concepts and reality.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>6. Truth</B>
<BR>What I now want to claim is that the construction of transient sentence-generated
fiat boundaries of the sort described by Daubert is pervasively involved
in all descriptive statement-making uses of language, that there are transient
fiat boundaries in the judgmental sphere analogous to the transient boundaries
of visual fields associated with acts of visual perception. In this connection
it is important to bear in mind that truth for empirical sentences has
classically been understood in terms of a correspondence relation (i.e.
of some sort of isomorphism) between a judgment or assertion on the one
hand and a certain portion of reality on the other. The central difficulty
standing in the way of this classical theory turned always on the fact
that reality evidently does not come ready-parceled into judgment-shaped
portions of the sort that would be predisposed to stand in relations of
correspondence of the suggested sort. The theory of language-induced fiat
boundaries can, however, allow us to treat judgment itself as a sui generis
variety of drawing fiat boundaries around entities in reality of the appropriate
(truth-making) sort.
<P>Let us define the judgment field as a portion of reality, a fiat object,
that is demarcated by the transient fiat boundary associated with a given
true empirical judgment. A judgment field is then a certain region of reality
through and around which the relevant judgmental fiat boundary is drawn.
As such it exists in and of itself, regardless of our judging activity.
The judgment field - called by Daubert the state of affairs or <I>Sachverhalt</I>
- is however also in a certain sense dependent on our judgment. For in
the absence of the judging activity an entity of the given sort would in
no way be demarcated from its surroundings and nor would it have the internal
demarcation-structure which it comes to have in virtue of the sentence
forms employed. In this way, then, cognitive linguistics can replace its
confused notion of conceptual reality with the geographer's notion of reality
subject to fiat articulations. It will then be in a position to exploit
its remarkably sophisticated resources for the analysis of the grammatical
structures at work in natural language in order to produce a truly adequate
account of truth for natural language in correspondence-theoretic terms.
