<p>We believe that, with a combination of detailed biology and rigorous
ontological analysis, it is possible to resolve the issue of when the human
individual begins to exist. We lay down a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions for being a human individual and we determine when these conditions
are first satisfied. We conclude that the pertinent categorial change takes
place around sixteen days after fertilization, and we consider a range
of arguments for and against this conclusion.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>0. Introduction</b>
<p>We shall help ourselves in what follows to the Danish term 'foster',
which refers in neutral fashion to the human zygote, embryo, or fetus at
the different stages of its development, and we shall focus on the question
of the transtemporal identity or non-identity of the foster with the human
individual as it exists after birth. In order to answer this question we
will need to take empirical details into account. It matters, for example,
whether or not the cells constituting the early embryo are a mere collection
(in much the same sense as a heap of grains of sand is a mere collection)
or whether they form some sort of genuine (causal) unity. However, we shall
also need to take into account the principles of ontology. This is because,
while it is sufficient to use our unaided common sense in order to establish
that, for example, mature adults are human beings, our common-sense concepts
are in need of careful elucidation if we are to be in a position to use
them to answer the much more difficult question concerning when human beings
begin to exist. The concepts we shall need for this purpose - concepts
of unity, identity, boundary, part, whole, dependence - are ontological
concepts.
<p>Our strategy will be to use such ontological concepts to lay down sufficient
conditions for being a human being. We shall then, by examining the biological
details of fetal development, establish when these conditions are first
satisfied. Along the way we shall test the robustness of our theory <i>inter
alia</i> by considering a range of possible counterexamples, entities which
are not human beings but which might be advanced as satisfying the conditions
listed. Unaided common sense, we might say, is a reliable tool in relation
to the standard average cases which fall within the interior of any given
domain. When we move out to consider examples on the outer fringes of the
domain, this helps us to test the adequacy of our elucidations of such
concepts.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1. The Marks of Substance</b>
<p>We take the ontological core of the common-sense concept of human being
to be captured by the philosopher's concept of an individual physical thing
or substance. (There is a related, though separate, issue of non-physical
substances, to which we shall return briefly in the sequel.)
<p>The marks of the concept of substance are as follows:<sup><a href="#N_2_">
(2)</a></sup>
<p><i>1.</i> A substance is a bearer of change. Substances undergo processes,
they participate in events, and they manifest contrary qualities at different
times. (John is sometimes warmer, sometimes cooler.)
<p><i>2. </i>A substance is an entity which persists self-identically through
time. It is an identity through change. A substance remains, from the beginning
to the end of its existence, numerically one and the same even when undergoing
alterations of a range of different sorts. (John is the same substance
as he was this morning, even though his temperature has changed.)
<p><i>3.</i> Each substance is extended in space, and thus it has spatial
parts. (The spatial parts of John are, for example, his arms and legs,
his cells and molecules.)<sup><a href="#N_3_"> (3)</a></sup></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>4. </i>Each substance possesses
its own complete, connected external boundary, analogous to the boundary
of a sphere or torus, which divides its interior from its exterior and
at the same time separates it spatially from other substances. Substances
are distinguished, through this separation, from the undetached parts of
substances. (John is distinguished from his arms and legs by the fact that
he possesses his own complete, connected external boundary.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>5. </i>The boundary of a substance
serves also to unify together its parts. A substance is distinguished,
through the connectedness of its boundary, from heaps or aggregates of
substances. (Consider the jazz band in which John plays of an evening.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>6. </i>Each substance is an independent
entity in the sense that it does not require the existence of any other
specific entity in order to exist.<sup><a href="#N_4_"> (4)</a></sup> Headaches,
waves and smiles are like substances in that they persist through time,
but they are unlike substances because they depend for their existence
on specific other things (and ultimately on substances) as their bearers
or carriers.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The concept of substance is a categorial
concept. This means that it is a highest-level concept obtained by generalization
from lower-level concepts such as: rabbit, mammal, animal. Other categorial
concepts are: event or process (terms we here use interchangeably), relation,
quality, and so on. Categorial concepts are such that, if an entity is
an instance of a given category at any stage of its existence, then it
instantiates this same category at every stage of its existence. This means,
<i>inter
alia</i>, that a substance cannot be transformed into a process (as a cardinal
number cannot be transformed into a peach or a ray of light). It is characteristic
of categorial concepts that they are instantiated either fully or not at
all. There are no degrees of substancehood (as there are no degrees of
identity or existence). Every categorial change is therefore instantaneous.</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>2. The Marks of Relatively Isolated
Causal Systems</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The above criteria are not, as yet,
sufficient for our purposes. For they are satisfied not only by human beings
and other organisms but also by bounded chunks of dead matter (for example
by planets, bricks or bowling balls). They are even satisfied by the whole
consisting of a closed box together with various wooden blocks which have
been placed inside it. And they are satisfied by a whole consisting of
various large and small fish together with a sealed aquarium inside which
they are swimming. Each single cell is a substance in something like this
latter sense: it has a membrane surrounding a nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and peroxisomes, all of which float
in an intracellular fluid.<sup><a href="#N_5_"> (5)</a></sup></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Cells, like human beings and other
organisms, are distinguished from wooden boxes, blocks of ice and similar
chunks of dead matter by the fact that they are
<i>unified causal systems
which are relatively isolated from their surroundings</i>.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">In order for an entity to constitute
a relatively isolated causal system in the sense here at issue, it must
be the case that:</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>7. </i>The external boundary of
the entity is established via a covering or membrane which extends continuously
across all or almost all of its surface ('almost all' because it typically
contains small apertures - such as the mouth or nostrils - which allow
interchange of substances such as air and food between interior and exterior).&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>8. </i>The events transpiring within
the interior of the entity are subject to a division between those falling
within a certain spectrum of allowed values, and those falling outside
this spectrum. The latter are distinguished by the fact that they will,
in cumulation, lead to the entity's ceasing to exist. Almost all of the
events within the interior of allowed values fall within a restricted family
of types of sequences of events (for example digestion), which are often
cyclically repeated.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>9.</i> The external membrane or
covering serves as a shield to protect the entity from those causal influences
deriving from its exterior which are likely to give rise to events which
are outside its spectrum of allowed values.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>10.</i> The entity contains within
itself mechanisms or procedures which are able to maintain (or, in cases
of disturbance, to reestablish) sequences of events falling within the
spectrum of allowed values. The entity also contains within itself mechanisms
or procedures for protecting and for reconstituting its external membrane
or covering in case of damage.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">To see the difference between the two
concepts of substance and relatively isolated causal system we note that
an amoeba, towards the end of a process of fission, is one substance (by
the connected exterior boundary criterion (<i>4.</i>)) but two causally
isolated systems. It becomes two causally isolated systems gradually, via
a continuous series of changes. It becomes two substances instantaneously,
via an abrupt topological change. Thus the concept of a relatively isolated
causal system is not a categorial concept but rather a concept that is
instantiated to different degrees by different entities. A block of ice
is a substance, but it is not a causally isolated system. An orbiting space-ship
is a substance and, with its sophisticated mechanisms for self-repair,
a causally isolated system. A circus is a causally isolated system (from
the beginning to the end of a performance) to the degree that it is shielded
by a membrane (the circus tent) from exterior influences. But it is not
a substance, because it fails to satisfy the condition of possessing its
own external boundary which separates it from other substances: the ground
beneath the circus is a boundary which it must share with the earth beneath.</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>3. The Hierarchical Structure of
the Human Organism</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The concept of a relatively isolated
causal system has been treated of extensively by the Polish ontologist
Roman Ingarden, who points out that organisms, in order to be able to sustain
themselves effectively as identical through time, must be at least in some
respects 'bounded off from the surrounding world and partially isolated
or, better, shielded from it.'<sup><a href="#N_6_"> (6)</a></sup></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">As Ingarden also points out, each multi-cellular
organism is a relatively isolated causal system which is organized in modular
fashion in such a way as to contain within itself numerous further relatively
isolated causal systems on successively lower levels. They are hierarchically
ordered and at the same time both partially interconnected (they collaborate
in their functioning) and also partially segregated from each other via
coverings or membranes which protect these interiors from certain external
influences and also allow other kinds of influences and substances to pass
through them. The whole body, too, 'is surrounded by a well-defined enclosure
- for man this is the skin, for the majority of animals - the hide.'<sup><a href="#N_7_">
(7)</a></sup> The skin or hide is itself a complex organ which is composed
of many layers and has many functions in the life-process, precisely because
it forms the boundary between the body and the external world. Thus it
is a permeable membrane, which participates in the expulsion of water and
waste-products.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Another example of a relatively isolated
causal system within the body is the digestive system which, thanks to
its walls, isolates ingested nutrients from the remaining parts of the
body in such a way as to allow the initial digestive processes to proceed.
Its permeable membranes then make possible a selective migration of the
chemical products of these processes through the walls and into the blood.
The heart and lungs, too, are separated from each other by appropriately
constructed membranes (pericardium, pleura), which shield the processes
occurring within them from outside influences.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">These systems are not absolutely closed
off from each other. Rather, again, they are partially open and partially
shielded. There are paths between them along which a certain restricted
spectrum of causal influences and substances may flow. Compare the way
in which each sense organ is a partially open system which is 'attuned
to a special selection of outside processes and at the same time also shielded
in other respects.'<sup><a href="#N_8_"> (8)</a></sup> (1984, p. 94)</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>4. When Does the Human Being Begin
to Exist?</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">We shall assume, for the moment, that
everything which satisfies conditions <i>1.-10.</i> above and is of human
descent is a human being. (We shall find reason to add two further conditions
in the sequel, but these are at this stage not pertinent to our argument.)
The apparent circularity in this statement - marked by the occurrence of
the term 'human' in the phrase 'is of human descent' - is innocuous given
that for many purposes we can appeal to the presence of DNA of a certain
specific type and this is something which can be established via quantitative
means quite independent of the sorts of ontological considerations advanced
here. There may, as we shall see, be other entities - such as Siamese twins
- which are also human beings but which fail to satisfy one or other of
the conditions mentioned. Consideration of such cases will throw useful
light on the concepts we employ, but our job will be done if we are able,
on the basis of the given set of conditions, to determine when these conditions
are first satisfied by a developing foster in the normal course of fetal
development.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">We take it as unproblematic that there
is a chain of events, starting with the movement of the sperm towards the
egg and leading on, in normal cases, through birth, and on still further
through the acquisition of self-awareness. We also take it as unproblematic
that this chain of events in its early phases does not yet involve a human
being and in its later phases does involve a human being which then preserves
its identity through time. This proposition is so strongly supported by
our ordinary pre-philosophical intuitions that one would need extraordinary
arguments in order to refute it.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">We shall seek to demonstrate that there
is a process of substance formation of which the human being is the result,
and that the formation of the human substance is a real change, occurring
at a determinate time. Thus we shall reject views according to which the
presence or absence of a human being might be a matter of mere convention
or fiat (for example views according to which the term 'human being' expresses
something like a legal fiction). We shall reject also that family of views
according to which human beings are formed via the acquisition of some
extra feature (such as consciousness, reason, self-awareness, the ability
to make morally relevant choices) on the part of some entity which, before
the acquisition of this feature, is not a human being. In case the the
extra feature is acquired in virtue of some underlying causally relevant
change in the entity itself, then it will be sufficient to investigate
this change in the foster from the perspective of substance formation,
and the same will apply also in case the extra feature is acquired via
some external agency (for example God implanting a soul in the newly formed
zygote) in such a way that this brings about a causally relevant change
in the entity itself.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Hypotheses according to which the human
being comes into existence via some external agency whose intervention
brings about no such change, we can here leave out of account, since we
are convinced that, armed with sufficiently powerful ontological tools,
it is possible to resolve the question here at issue already on the basis
of an examination of the biological (causally relevant) aspects of the
matters in question.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">If at some earlier time in the course
of the development of the foster a human being does not exist, and at some
later time a human being does exist, then at some point in the intervening
interval a change takes place which is a categorial change. We said earlier
that a substance is a bearer of change. We now see that substances cannot
be the sole bearers of change, since a categorial change is a change in
which a substance itself comes into or goes out of existence. Consider
a larva which turns into a butterfly. The same matter now instantiates
one form, now another. This suggests that in order to do justice to the
fact that change occurs only if there is something which changes we adopt
the view developed by Aristotle in his
<i>Metaphysics</i>. According to
this view, a categorial change is a change in matter, and the identity
through time and survival of a substance, for example of an organism, is
based on the continued existence of a certain form or organization.<sup><a href="#N_9_">
(9)</a></sup></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Consider two pools of water which merge
to become one. The same matter now instantiates one form, now another.
Something similar must occur in the course of development of a human being.
A given body of matter now instantiates one form (say: that of a cluster
of cells), now another (it is a human being, a single substance). Such
a change of category is different from the ordinary sort of change which
you undergo when you dye your hair or grow your nails. With a change of
category one entity ceases to exist and some different entity comes into
existence.&nbsp;</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>5. The Varieties of Substance Formation</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">We know from other domains that the
formation of entities can happen in a variety of different ways. Biological
species form via budding from existing species. Bacteria form via cell
division. Bangla Desh was formed via the separation of East and West Pakistan.
Budapest was formed via the fusion of Buda and Pest. How do human beings
form? Let us outline here the possible alternatives:</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">i) <i>Budding</i>: A part of one individual
substance is detached therefrom and forms a new individual substance in
its own right while the original substance goes on existing. We might detach
the tail from a cat. Before the loss of the tail, the cat is both one substance
and one relatively isolated causal system. Upon the loss of the tail, which
is an abrupt topological change, both the cat and the tail are substances.
However, only the cat is a relatively isolated causal system; the tail
is just dead matter. Substance formation of a biologically more pertinent
sort occurs through budding in those organisms which reproduce by making
small dormant cells within themselves and then releasing them into the
environment.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">ii) <i>Separation</i>: Two or more
entities are joined together as one entity and at some point the relations
conjoining the parts of this entity are disrupted in such a way that the
previously attached individuals continue as separate new substances. Consider,
for example, a pair of Siamese twins who are separated by means of surgery.
The connected Siamese twins constitute one substance, by our criteria,
where the separated Siamese twins are two substances. The Siamese twins,
however, may constitute two relatively isolated causal systems both before
and after the detachment.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">iii) <i>Fission</i>:<i> </i>Fission
is distinct from separation in that, when an entity (for example a virus
or other microbe) undergoes fission, new parts are formed which then split
apart to lead separate existences. Fission gives rise to new entities and
destroys the entities which existed earlier. An amoeba, for example, divides
by duplicating its nucleus and then allowing the rest of the cell to split
apart, via an abrupt topological change, into two new organisms of roughly
equal size.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">iv) <i>Unification</i>: Separate individual
substances join into a complex which forms one new substance in which the
previously detached separate substances continue to exist as entities joined
together within the new whole (unification is the dual of separation).
Many examples of this type of substance formation are found in the realm
of physical processes (for example when separate water molecules condense
to form a single drop of water) or in the realm of artefacts (when a table
is formed by nailing together several blocks of wood).</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">v) <i>Fusion:</i> Fusion is distinct
from unification in that, when entities undergo fusion, then they thereby
cease to exist (fusion is the dual of fission). Fusion gives rise to a
new entity, as for example when two drops of water join together to become
one; their respective parts merge to form a perfect mixture.</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>6. The Development of the Foster</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Our aim is to establish the ontology
of the process by which human beings are formed. To this end we will need
to consider briefly the biological details of the development of the foster.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The story begins when an egg-cell,
developed in the ovaries, is released into the fimbrated end of the fallopian
tube (ovulation). The egg-cell, swimming free in the fluid-filled tube,
is encountered by a sperm, and the latter initiates a process of penetration.
(This is what happens in the normal case. In very rare circumstances a
sperm cell might attach itself to one of the additional, much tinier cells
which are also floating in the fallopian tube. These are the so-called
'polar bodies', deriving from eggs released at earlier stages in their
development.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Fertilization. </i>The first stage
in the process of penetration is the fusion of the membrane of the sperm
cell with that of the egg. This results in the formation of a channel that
allows the passage of the nucleus of the sperm cell into the egg. The male
genetic material that is carried by this nucleus then fuses with genetic
material from the nucleus of the egg-cell. The two nuclei come into contact
in the egg cytoplasm, and shed their nuclear membranes. Each offers up
one complete set of 23 chromosomes, and these two sets of chromosomes become
entwined around each other as part of a process which transforms the egg-cell
into a new joint product, called the zygote, an unusually large cell which
has the same membrane as the egg-cell before fertilization.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Cell Division. </i>Immediately upon
formation the zygote begins to undergo a process of cell division. During
the very first cell divisions (up to the eight-cell stage), there is no
qualitative distinction between the cell that is dividing and the cells
resulting from the division. The cells are functionally and qualitatively
undifferentiated. Thus, each has the potential to produce a complete human
being (each is, as the jargon has it, 'totipotential'). The cells are kept
together spatially by a surrounding thin membrane (the <i>zona pellucida</i>),
which was also the membrane of the egg-cell before fertilization, but there
is no causal interaction between them. They are separate bodies which adhere
to each other through their sticky surfaces. The cells are at this stage
still floating free, inside their common membrane, in the fluid-filled
fallopian tube, but they have begun to move towards the womb (uterus).</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Formation of the Morula. </i>Because
of the limited space within the <i>zona pellucida</i>, a compaction takes
place between the 8- and 16-cell stage (day 3).<sup><a href="#N_10_"> (10)</a></sup>
As a result of this compaction, the inner cells divide faster than the
outer cells which surround them. At this time tight junctions between the
cells are formed; neighboring cells are connected by highly selective permeable
membranes which are marked by channels through which signal molecules can
be transported from one side to the other. The resulting bundle of cells
is now called a <i>morula</i> (Latin for 'mulberry'). The morula is formed
as the cells move from the fallopian tube and into the womb.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">When there are about 60 cells present
(day 4), there occurs a clear differentiation between the so-called 'inner
cell mass' and 'the trophectoderm' (an outer ring of cells). The latter
functions henceforth as the surrounding membrane in place of the
<i>zona
pellucida</i> which disintegrates. In addition, pools of clear fluid which
had accumulated between some of the internal cells coalesce to form a common
cavity called the <i>blastocoel</i>, a body of extracellular fluid in which
the inner cell mass thereafter floats. The two groups of cells, taken together
with this fluid, are now called the 'blastocyst'. The entire blastocyst
itself floats freely in the uterine fluid for about a day and continues
to exist disconnected from the mother.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Implantation. </i>Over the next
week (days 6-13) there occurs a process called implantation (also 'nidation',
from the Latin <i>nidus</i>: a nest, or niche). The blastocyst, on completing
its journey along the fallopian tube into the uterine cavity, moves into
a position where it is in contact with the uterine wall, to which it adheres
via its sticky exterior. Cells on its outer surface then begin to grow
rapidly in such a way as to disrupt the surface of the wall. These cells
actively burrow into the deeper tissue until they have become completely
embedded. The inner cells of the blastocyst are however still not connected
to the mother, since they float in the liquid contained within the trophoblastic
membrane. With the implantation of the blastocyst in the wall of the womb
comes the formation from its inner cell mass of what is called the 'embryonic
disc'. This consists of two kinds of cell mass: the epiblast, which will
eventually give rise to the embryo proper and to parts of the umbilical
cord; and the hypoblast which will give rise to extra-embryonic membranes
and tissues.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Gastrulation. </i>When the embryonic
disc is fully implanted in the wall of the womb (day 13), it is able to
grow and can begin to differentiate into the various tissues that will
characterize the human being into which it develops. Only at this point
does the disc begin to receive nutrients from the mother. Until now, only
cell division has taken place. The morula has not grown in size compared
to the egg-cell; rather, its constituent cells have become smaller. Now
however the embryonic disc begins to grow, as the neural folds are formed
and the primitive cardiovascular system begins to function. This stage,
which begins around day 14-15, is called 'gastrulation'. It consists in
a convergence of the epiblastic cells into what is called 'the primitive
streak', a stacking of cells on the end of the embryonic disc which will
develop into the spine. During the process of gastrulation (days 14-19),
the epiblast differentiates into three cell types: the mesoderm (which
will become the smooth muscle coats, connective tissues, blood cells, bone
marrow, the skeleton and the reproductive and excretory organs of the fetus),
the ectoderm (which will become the epithelia and the nervous system),
and the endoderm (which will become the linings of the respiratory passages
and of the digestive tract). In addition, some cells of the epiblast form
the umbilical cord. Not all of the cells of the embryonic disc are going
to develop into the fetus. Some of its cells (the non-epiblastic cells)
will form the extraembryonic membranes (the amnion, the chorion and part
of the placenta) and other extra embryonic tissues.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The embryonic disc is now commonly
referred to as the embryo proper, a term which is used to describe the
developing foster until the ninth week after fertilization, from when it
is called the 'fetus'.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">A few days after gastrulation there
begins to form the fluid-filled amniotic cavity in which the foster will
float until the end of its term. This amniotic cavity is within the wall
of the uterus, and as it expands it brings about a consequent contraction
of the uterine cavity proper. Surprisingly, therefore, the embryo/fetus
is for almost the whole of its development not, strictly speaking, inside
the uterus (or womb, or uterine cavity); rather it is lodged within a specially
created cavity inside the uterine lining. This multiple-cavity structure
enclosing the foster provides a cushion against mechanical injury.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The placenta is a flat organ which
supplies nutrients for the fetus during its development. It develops from
the outer cell layer (from the trophoblastic cells) in the early embryo
which fastens itself to the wall of the uterus from around day 21 and becomes
anchored to the mother via a maternal portion formed by part of the functional
layer of the uterine membrane. Together with the other fetal membranes
(the amnion and the chorion), it disintegrates some moments after birth,
when it is delivered through the birth canal.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The umbilical cord is an organ of the
fetus that penetrates the placenta via two large arteries which radiate
outwards from the point where breaks through into the inner surface of
the placenta and divide into small arteries that penetrate ever further
into the depths of the placenta through hundreds of branching strands of
tissue known as 'villi'. These villi cause a rupturing of the mother's
blood vessels in their vicinity and are thereby bathed in maternal blood.
The constant circulation of fetal and maternal blood and the very thin
tissue separating fetal blood from maternal blood bathing the villi provide
a mechanism for interchange of blood constituents between the maternal
and fetal bloodstreams. However, it is normally not the case that there
is opportunity for the blood of one to gain access to the blood vessels
of the other. Rather, nutrients, oxygen, and antibodies diffuse into the
fetal blood in the capillaries of the villi, and wastes and carbon dioxide
diffuse out of these capillaries into the maternal blood circulation. (Compare
the way in which oxygen is transmitted to fish via pipes which feed air
into the water of an aquarium.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Development of the Fetus. </i>At
about 40 to 43 days after conception the rudimentary brain at the top of
the primitive streak begins to function. At the ninth week, the fetus has
almost all human characteristics (except for the face and genitals) and
it begins to show signs of specific male or female development. During
the tenth week, the face and the genitals begin to develop. In the twelfth
week, when the foster is nine centimeters long, it begins to move its hands
and feet. Its movements increase around the sixteenth week, when hair also
begins to grow and teeth are developed. At the twentieth week, the foster
can suck and swallow and its body bends and stretches. From then on the
foster continues to grow in size until, at the end of the fortieth week,
it is born.</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>7. Alternative Thresholds</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Given this simplified account of fetal
development, let us return to the question of transtemporal identity. When
does the foster first satisfy the ten conditions set out above for being
a substance which is also a relatively isolated causal system? At what
stage is the foster transtemporally identical to the human being it becomes
after birth? We distinguish the following nine possibilities:</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">a. The stage of the single-cell zygote
(day 0)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">b: The stage of the multi-cell zygote
(days 0-3)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">c. The stage of the morula (day 3)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">d. The stage of the early blastocyst
(day 4)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">e. Implantation (days 6-13)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">f. The formation of the primitive streak
(days 14-16)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">g. Viability (e.g. day 140)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">h. Birth (day 275)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">i. The development of self-consciousness
(some time after birth)</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">a. The zygote is a substance: it is
a bearer of change; it persists through a time-interval; it is extended
in space and it has spatial parts such as the nucleus, the cell-membrane
and the filaments inside it; it has its own connected exterior boundary
which divides its interior from its exterior and which connects the parts
within its interior and thus distinguishes it from a mere heap or collection.
Moreover the zygote is an independent entity in the sense that it does
not require the existence of any specific second entity in order to exist.
(Thus it can survive transplantation.) The zygote is moreover, like every
other cell, a relatively isolated causal system. It is shielded by its
outer membrane from causal influences deriving from its exterior; the events
transpiring within its interior are subject to a division between stable
and critical events; and it contains its own rudimentary mechanisms for
reestablishing stability in cases of disturbance. But there is an obvious
reason why this zygote substance cannot be identical to the human being
which will exist after birth, namely that it is predestined to undergo
fission, and this means that it will cease to exist almost immediately
after it has been formed.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">b. The second possibility is that it
is at the stage of the multi-cellular zygote-bundle that the human being
comes into existence. But the zygote is at this stage most properly conceived
as a sticky assemblage of 8 or 16 entities rather than as a single entity.
They are not one but many. Although they are surrounded by a thin permeable
membrane, this membrane merely helps to keep the cells together in the
spatial sense; there is no flow of nutrients or signal molecules from the
outside to the inside of the membrane or from one cell to another, and
the cell bundle has no stability-restoring mechanism of its own of the
sort which is required in order for the whole entity to be a single causal
system.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Perhaps, though, we can hold on to
the view that the multi-cell zygote is already a human individual by arguing
that some one cell within the bundle is privileged by the fact that it
inherits from the original single cell the property of serving as the bearer
of identity for the human being that is in process of development. The
problem with this view is that it contradicts totipotentiality -- the feature
in virtue of which each of the cells within the multi-cell zygote has the
full potential to develop into a human being.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">To see the problem here, we must understand
how differentiation works. Differentiation is the creation, from a mere
aggregate of homogeneous cells, of clusters of functionally and structurally
different types of connected tissue at different sites. In the case before
us, all the cells maintain forever the same genetic composition (that of
the original fertilized egg-cell). However, the very genes involved contain
the programming for differentiation. This programming goes into effect
in different cells in different ways, not because of any intrinsic features
of the cells themselves, but rather as a result of the specific environments
surrounding them and thus of the macroscopic structures which they together
go to form. This surrounding context determines that some of the genes
within each given cell become repressed, so that only some types of protein
are made. That it is the environment surrounding a given cell which determines
what kind of proteins will be formed (or 'expressed') by the cell can be
seen from the fact that, if cells of a given type are moved artificially
to a different environment where they are surrounded by cells of a different
type, then they will begin to express the same proteins as the cells which
surround them. Since, at the stage of the multi-celled zygote, no differentiation
has taken place, it follows that there can be no cell or bundle of cells
within the cluster which is privileged in virtue of some intrinsic feature
which it might possess.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">c. At the formation of the morula,
too, differentiation has not yet taken place, and so the just-mentioned
argument can be applied in this case also (as also in cases d. and e.,
below). Each of the cells of the morula still has the potential to become
a human being. At this stage, junctions between the cells of the zygote
are formed which allow intercellular communication by means of small signal-molecules.
But the morula still fails to meet condition <i>10. </i>for being a causally
isolated system. That is, it does not possess mechanisms of its own to
restore stability in cases of external disturbance. At best it must rely
on the separate rudimentary stability-restoring mechanisms of its constituent
cells. The morula is still, in our terms, a loosely connected cluster of
cells.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">d. At the stage of the early blastocyst,
the cells have differentiated into the inner cell mass and the surrounding
trophoblast. The inner cell mass constitutes a single substance, rather
than many substances, insofar as its cells together form a single connected
whole with a common physical boundary. The inner cell mass also begins
to constitute a relatively isolated causal system, but it still lacks its
own internal mechanisms in virtue of which its several parts would in cases
of disturbance work together as a whole to restore stability. The inner
cell mass will differentiate into two further tissues and only one of them
will eventually become the embryo. The other will turn into membranes and
extraembryonic tissue. This is not in and of itself important for determining
whether or not it is transtemporally identical to the later human being,
for one may argue that the membranes and extraembryonic tissues are merely
temporary parts of the embryo in much the same sense as baby teeth are
temporary parts of the child. What is important, however, is that, following
our account of differentiation above, it is not yet determined which parts
of the inner cell mass are predestined to become embryonic cells. Thus
the stage of formation of the inner cell mass at day 4 still does not seem
to be a good candidate stage for the formation of the human being.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">e. When the process of implantation
comes to an end, the embryo can begin to receive nutrients from the mother
and can begin to grow as an individual and to differentiate into tissues
of different sorts which are recognizable precursors of neonatal tissues.
However, as for the early blastocyst, so also here, it seems that the foster
still lacks its own integrated mechanism for restoring stability, and so
it fails to be a relatively isolated causal system in the sense at issue.
An identification of the foster as it now exists with the later human being,
however, faces the problem that the foster has entered into a condition
of being dependent on the mother the mother for nutrients and oxygen as
well as for temperature control and other forms of protection. Does this
imply that the foster is henceforth such as to fall short of being a substance
because it does not satisfy condition <i>6.</i>?<i> </i>Certainly, if it
is extracted from the mother it will almost certainly die through lack
of nutrients and through lack of an appropriate protective environment
into which it can fit. But this applies also, for example, to an Arctic
explorer in relation to her winter ice station.<i> </i>It is known from
the animal kingdom that premature offspring can often survive in external
environments. A kangaroo foster, for example, is born alive at a very immature
stage when it is only about one inch long and weighs less than one gram.
After birth it uses its forelimbs to crawl up the mother's body and enter
the pouch which is a pocket on the mother which opens forward and contains
teats. The baby kangaroo grows in the pocket and gradually spends more
and more time outside the pouch, which it leaves for good at the age of
seven to ten months. The amniotic cavity, in which the foster develops
upon implantation, is in some sense like a kangaroo pouch, though instead
of being open (in the sense of having an aperture) it is a closed cavity.
As the kangaroo foster is not rigidly dependent on one specific mother,
but only on an appropriate environment with teats and so forth, so the
foster is not rigidly dependent on the mother, but only on some appropriate
environment, which might from a certain point be supplied by means of an
incubator. This means that the foster is not dependent on the mother in
the ontological sense of dependence that is involved, for example, in the
relation between a smile and a face, or between an individual instance
of color and some extended surface.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">f. According to Ford (1988), the point
where a human individual comes into existence is the time when the epiblast
ceases to be a cluster of homogenous cells and begins to transform itself
into a heterogeneous entity. He suggests that this happens with the formation
of the primitive streak (around day 16). At this point, he argues, the
cells of the epiblast have formed a whole multicellular individual living
being which has a body axis and bilateral symmetry; that is, it is spatially
oriented. The embryo's cranial axis and its dorsal and ventral surfaces
come into existence, and the whole has acquired effective mechanisms to
protect itself and to restore stability in face of disturbance.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">McLaren (1984), too, offers a defense
of the thesis that it is the formation of the primitive streak which marks
the beginning of the human being. This, he argues, marks the beginning
of a human individual insofar as the boundaries of a discrete, coherent
entity have now been formed. At this point the foster also meets the other
part of criterion <i>8. </i>to the effect that it is protected against
outside disturbance by the jacket of cells surrounding it. That is to say,
at the formation of the primitive streak, there is formed for the first
time a bona fide spatial boundary which delineates the embryo spatially
from the extraembryonic tissue. Before this point it is not determined
which cells will become the embryo and which the surrounding membranes.
In the case of adult human beings, in contrast, it is determined which
parts (for example: nails, hair) can be removed without the human being
ceasing to exist. In this respect too, therefore, the foster is from the
stage of the formation of the primitive streak more like the adult human
being than it is like the foster at earlier stages.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The tighter integration of the foster
that arises with the formation of the primitive streak is manifested most
importantly in the fact that twinning is from this point on no longer possible.
If fission occurs just before the formation of the primitive streak, this
will in almost all cases give rise to malformations (Siamese twins).</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">g. It has often been suggested that
the human individual begins to exist at the point when the foster becomes
viable; that is, when it can live outside its mother's womb. The argument
is that because, prior to this time, the foster cannot survive independently
of its mother, it is analogous to an organ of the mother, which can only
exist and exercise its proper function within the locus of its proper encompassing
environment. The problem with this view, however, is that the transition
to viability does not in itself connote a transformation of one entity
into another. The passage into viability of the foster may coincide with
such a transformation process, but it does not necessarily do so. Rather,
this passage may involve no genuine change in the foster, but may represent
a mere Cambridge change of the sort which is expressed by propositions
such as 'John is no longer beloved in South Africa', or 'Mary just ceased
to be the tallest player in the team.' Acquiring stronger muscles is a
real (though not a categorial) change, but the satisfaction of the viability
criterion is not dependent on such physical changes in the foster; it may
be satisfied, for example, through advances in technology.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">h. Another alternative is that it is
the event of birth which marks the initiation of the human being. Consider,
for example, the Talmudic doctrine according to which the foster is a limb
of the mother, so that only once its head has emerged from the mother's
body does it begin to exist as a substance in its own right. We shall argue
below, however, that birth is the mere passage of an entity from one environment
to another. That is to say, it is a process of a sort that does not affect
the ontological category of the entity involved. If the human being exists
at birth, then it exists also in the minutes prior to birth, and then our
question as to when the human individual begins to exist arises once again.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Could birth constitute a sharp boundary
for the initiation of human existence? Bermudez (1996) points to the fact
that there is a difference between the fetus and the newly born infant
in reflection of the fact that the neonate can engage in forms of cognition
that are unavailable inside the womb. Consciousness emerges outside the
womb, and is largely dependent on the extra-uterine environment. On the
view we have been defending, birth does not involve a transformation of
the foster into some new substance. But might we not take an alternative
view, according to which the concept <i>human being</i> is not a substantial
concept at all, but rather a relational concept, so that to be a human
being is to be, inter alia, in a certain sort of environment? (Compare
the way in which the concept of a pawn is tied to the environment of a
chess game.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The objection to any approach along
these lines is that it is not clear whether the thesis that a human being
exists only in a certain sort of environment is a conceptual thesis or
a merely empirical thesis. If it is conceptual in nature, then we can consider
a thought experiment in which a fetus remains in a specially tended and
adapted womb/incubator perhaps for many years beyond its term, growing
and acquiring many of the features normally considered as characteristic
of a human being, perhaps including features of reason and consciousness.
The organism in question would not be a human being, on the relational
understanding. If, on the other hand, it is an empirical thesis, then it
is unclear what is to count as evidence for or against its truth.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">i. The final alternative is that it
is the acquisition of some extra feature which marks the beginning of the
human individual. One obvious candidate is consciousness, and in particular
self-consciousness. This position was, for example, supported by Locke,
for whom the main characteristic of a human individual is that it can consider
itself as itself.<sup><a href="#N_11_"> (11)</a></sup></span><span STYLE="font-family: Times"></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Can we, then, identify the acquisition
of the capacity for self-consciousness (or of some similar capacity) as
marking the point when the human being begins to exist? Such a dispositional
property requires in every case some underlying real basis, i.e. a basis
which is not itself merely dispositional. The corresponding physical change
in this case might be an increase in complexity of nerve-connections in
the brain. The proponents of alternative i., therefore, are asking us to
accept that a change of this sort within a certain part of the matter of
the object would bring about a substantial change in the object as a whole.
We do not rule out the possibility that a thesis along the lines might
be true. However if it is more than a mere conceptual or definitional matter,
then the thesis would require powerful argumentsof a sort which have not
been provided. In other cases where a new capacity is acquired we do not,
after all, talk in terms of the corresponding underlying physical change
in a part of the organism as marking the coming into being of a whole new
substance.<sup><a href="#N_12_"> (12)</a></sup></span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>8. Twinning</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The principal argument against alternatives
a. - e., above, turns on the phenomenon of twinning. Ford (1988) and Diamond
(1975), among others, have argued that the zygote/early embryo cannot be
a human individual if it can undergo division in such a way that the results
of this division can develop separately to form two distinct human individuals.
A single human individual cannot give rise to two human individuals in
this way. One argument in support of their view might read as follows:</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">A</span><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">
correct account of the concept human being must in every case yield a determinate
answer to questions like 'how many human beings are there in this room?'
The possibility of twinning shows, however, that no concept satisfying
this
condition could be applied to a foster before the emergence of the primitive
streak, because prior to this stage of development it will be indeterminate
whether there is one or two individuals.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To see the force of this
argument we need to focus carefully on the question of the transtemporal
identity of the foster with the human being which exists after birth in
the case where twinning does not in fact occur but is nonetheless still
possible, in light of the three alternative accounts of twinning which
can be distinguished in light of the three varieties of substance formation
by division - budding, separation and fission - distinguished above.&nbsp;</span>
<p>A proposal defended by Daly (1985, p. 51) is that the human individual
can survive the twinning process because the latter can be understood as
a process of forming human individuals via budding. Twinning, on this account,
is in fact a form of cloning. Similar phenomena are after all known from
the vegetable kingdom, where a cutting from one plant may be planted in
the soil to result in a new plant without the original plant ceasing to
exist as a separate individual. Daly also mentions mitosis in bacteria,
where a single bacterium divides into two separate bacteria. However, neither
of these examples is convincing as examples in favor of the thesis that
twinning among humans is consistent with the continued existence of an
individual substance. First, human development is nothing like that of
plants. When a cutting is taken from a fully developed plant we do not
have one cell which divides into two; no division takes place at all. Rather
the situation is analogous to one in which one would grow a new human individual
from a nail or a lump of hair. The bacterial example is more convincing
in this respect, but the problem here is that nothing in bacterial mitosis
supports the view that the original bacterium survives as an individual
substance. Rather, everything points to an account of the matter according
to which bacterial division is a process of fission in our technical sense.
<p>There is another problem with the view proposed. Consider the so-called
'mosaic chimeras' or twin-within-a-twin individuals.<sup><a href="#N_13_">
(13)</a></sup> These are single human individuals, most of whose tissues
bear the marks of two distinct cell lines which come from two distinct
sperm (they may even, in rare cases, come from two distinct fathers). Mosaic
chimeras result when one sperm fertilizes the egg and another fertilizes
one of the other cells (the already mentioned 'polar bodies') separating
at the time of the formation of the egg. The two zygotes may then fuse
to form a single individual (which is accordingly a result of quadruple
fusion). Suppose we were to say, with Daly, that zygotes are already human
individuals. We would then have to say, in the case where both the egg-cell
and a polar body are fertilized, that the two fertilized cell clusters
are already two human individuals. A mosaic chimera is the result of fusion
of two such fertilized cell clusters. In all other respects, however, it
is like every other human being: it is one substance and one relatively
isolated causal system, and it has all the characteristics of a normal
human individual.
<p>What of the case where a foster is structured in such a way that twinning
can still occur via <i>separation</i>? This would mean that the foster
is already not one but two entities, both of which would survive, should
twinning occur, to form two independent fosters. The separable foster,
at the times when separation is still possible, would lack the sort of
integrity which would make it a unity in its own right. It might be compared
to a pair of railway carriages joined together by a loose bond, which may
break or which may be strengthened by degrees in such a way that the results
of this strengthening form a single entity. The problem with this view,
however, is that&nbsp;<span STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">we know
empirically that twinning is, at least in many cases, a phenomenon that
is caused by accidental interventions deriving from the external environment;
thus it is not in every case determined at times prior to division that
twinning will occur. Thus an account of twinning as separation provides
nothing to which we could point as the human being at stages when twinning
of this accidental sort is still possible.</span>
<p>What, finally, of the case where twinning can still occur via fission?
Here we might suppose that we have a structure analoguous to that of an
amoeba, whose interior bonds are insufficiently strong to prevent division,
but which are yet sufficiently strong to constitute a unity. In such cases,
surely, we would have no hesitation in asserting that the identity of the
entity in question persists across an interval during which the amoeba
is susceptible to fission but does not, in fact, divide. The case is however
much rather one in which the interior bonds of the foster undergo a cumulative
process of strengthening. Until this process has reached a point where
twinning is no longer possible, we have a situation that is analoguous
to a collection of railway carriages that might divide and coalesce into
separate clusters of carriages in any one of a large number of ways, each
one of which would signify the ceasing to exist of the entity that is thereby
subject to division. Here again, therefore, we have nothing to which we
could point as the human being at stages when twinning is still possible.
<p>It follows from the above that we need to add a further condition to
our list above in order to rule out from candidacy as human beings those
entities which have within themselves the potentiality to undergo division.
All organic entities lose parts over time (as you lose hair and skin, for
example). What we need to exclude is that an entity of a given type should
be subject to a division into two or more entities which are similar to
itself in the way in which this is possible, for example, in the case of
an amoeba, or an earthworm. An entity is <i>non-divisible</i>, in this
sense, if it satisfies:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>11. </i>The parts of the entity and the processes in its interior
are integrated together in such a way that it is not possible that the
entity should divide into two or more entities which themselves satisfy
conditions <i>1.-10. </i>above.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>An entity which satisfies condition <i>11. </i>is, we might say, a unity,
a single substance, not merely actually but also potentially.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>9. The Concept of Niche</b>
<p>But we must add one further condition to our list. For consider John's
heart. This is a substance, and it is a relatively isolated causal system;
it is non-divisible; and it is a product of human reproduction; yet it
is not itself a human being because it is not a <i>maximal </i>entity satisfying
these conditions: it belongs as proper part to John's organism as a whole.
On the other hand, however, John is himself not a maximal causally isolated
substance in all the phases of his existence. Suppose, for example, that
John is inside a spaceship and is working the ship's controls. The mereological
sum of John and the spaceship is then a substance, by our criteria above.
It is also, to a degree, a relatively isolated causal system. But there
is however a difference between John in his relation to the spaceship,
on the one hand, and the various cells and organs in their relation to
the organism of which they form a part, on the other. John is not in the
spaceship in the way in which, for example, a nucleus is <i>in</i> the
cell or the heart or brain is in the body. Rather, John is in the spaceship
as a bird is in its nest or as a bear is in its cave. More generally, John
is in his spaceship as an organism is in its niche (which means, <i>inter
alia, </i>that he can leave the spaceship and then return, he can be replaced
by another human being at the ship's control, and so on).
<p>Intuitively, a niche is a part of reality into which an object fits,
and into and out of which the object can move. A niche and its tenant do
not overlap (they have no parts in common). Rather the niche <i>surrounds</i>
its tenant, and the notion of surrounding<i> </i>that is here at work can
be precisely specified via tools of mereology, topology and the theory
of spatial location.<sup><a href="#N_14_"> (14)</a></sup> A niche and its
tenant are disconnected from each other in the sense that they share no
boundaries in the way in which, for example, a cat(-torso) shares a boundary
in common with its tail. The surrounding relation between a niche and its
tenant is thus to be distinguished from the relationship of perfectly tight
connection of the sort which we find in the case of
<i>David</i> trapped
within the interior of the block of stone before Michelangelo gets to work.
For there must on all sides be a certain degree of free play between the
niche and the tenant housed inside it. The niche-tenant relation must therefore
involve some sort of cavity, of air, water, or some other medium, by which
the tenant is surrounded. John, in sum, is <i>in</i> the spaceship not
as a part is in its whole, but rather as an organism is in its niche.
<p>To see the contrast here, let us suppose that John is involved in an
accident which destroys the skin over the entire surface of his body. On
one scenario, the doctors graft a new skin onto his body that is made of
some synthetic material. On another scenario they create a space suit-like
cover for John, which he will henceforth wear. In the former case, we say
that the synthetic skin is a part of John (the doctors have created for
John a new, synthetic organ). In the latter case, we say that the space
suit creates a niche for John, into which John fits, and which is then
such that John and his niche have no parts in common. Note that the issue
here does not turn on what the skin, or suit, is made of. We can imagine,
for example, some future spacesuit-like container-niche for John that is
constructed out of human DNA teased into weavable plastic form.
<p>We can now lay down our needed supplementary criterion as follows. Intuitively,
we want it to be the case that a maximal entity in the sense here at issue
is an entity which, if it belongs as part to a larger substantial whole,
then only because it stands, within this larger whole, in a tenant-niche
relationship. We can state, more precisely, that an entity <i>x </i>is
a maximal substantial, non-divisible relatively isolated causal system
if:
<p><i>12.</i> (i) <i>x</i> satisfies conditions <i>1.-11.</i> and (ii)
every entity <i>y</i> which has <i>x</i> as a proper part and which also
satisfies these conditions has some part which is a niche for
<i>x</i>.
<p>Normally, the niche for <i>x</i> will simply be the result of subtracting
<i>x
</i>from
the whole <i>y.
</i>Thus if John (<i>x</i>) is alone inside the spaceship,
then the relevant value of <i>y </i>is: John plus the spaceship (the two
mereologically summed together), and the relevant niche is just the spaceship
itself. John is not a part of this niche, but rather (trivially) a part
of the mereological sum of the niche together with himself.
<p>An interesting illustration of the workings of our twelve conditions
is provided by the case of cryogenically frozen human beings. We are to
imagine a living human being whose metabolism is suppressed by freezing
and who is preserved in the frozen state by means of some surrounding refrigerator-like
mechanism. Here, the organism's own mechanisms for sustaining and restoring
bodily stability are put out of action and the tenant of the cryogenic
niche borrows these mechanisms from its new artificial surroundings. Yet
the organism still has these mechanisms (even if in a dormant state), and
thus our twelve conditions are fully satisfied. It is an implication of
the view here defended that brain-stem death does not in and of itself
amount to the ceasing to exist of the human being. The brain-stem dead
individual is, precisely, kept alive in an oxygen cubator and satisfies
all the conditions set forth above. However, our twelve conditions may
not be satisfied by human beings on the threshold of death, beings who
are dying precisely because the mechanisms for self-repair are no longer
functioning. To some degree in conflict with current medical orthodoxy
we prefer to describe such an individual as being not dead, but rather
(irreversibly) dying.
<p>Our remarks on cryogenically frozen human beings can throw some light
also on the question whether human beings in general might be formed at
some very early stage in their development (e.g. at the stage of the single
zygote) though in such a way that the capacities which make them relatively
isolated causal systems would exist only in a dormant form. Some marginal
kinds of life (e.g. a virus in its non-active phase) may display for long
periods a complete lack of metabolism, but we call a virus living because
of its potential to engage in an active, self-replicating phase when it
is coupled to the metabolism of more complicated host organisms. The same
goes for simple animals (e.g. some shrimp species) which are able to stay
completely metabolism-free during long, cold seasons. Such organisms must
have the capacity to display metabolism in other phases of their existence,
otherwise we would not call them organisms at all. What counts against
drawing conclusions from such considerations for the human case, however,
is once again the issue of twinning, which is still possible at the stage
of the zygote and at all later stages prior to the formation of the primitive
streak.

<p><b>10. Is the Foster Connected to the Mother?</b>
<p>Any entity which satisfies condition <i>12. </i>and which is a product
of human reproduction will be a human being. From the stage of formation
of the primitive streak (around day 16), the foster constitutes a single
substance with its own external physical boundary, it is a relatively isolated
causal system with its own mechanisms for restoring stability, and it is
non-divisible. It remains to show that the foster from this stage satisfies
also the maximality condition. We need to establish, in other words, that
every entity containing the foster as proper part which satisfies conditions
<i>1.-11.</i>
has, from this time, some part which is a niche for the foster. Since the
only candidate for such an entity is the mother, we need to establish the
nature of the relation between the foster and the mother: is it that of
tenant to niche, or that of part to whole, or is it some other sort of
relation?
<p>It will help to distinguish here between 'fiat' and 'bona fide' boundaries.<sup><a href="#N_15_">
(15)</a></sup> Fiat boundaries are boundaries which do not fully correspond
to physical discontinuities in the underlying territory. Examples are found
above all in the realm of arbitrarily demarcated entities such as counties,
postal districts, census tracts, or air traffic corridors. Bona fide boundaries,
on the other hand, are physical discontinuities in the usual sense of this
term: for example the edge of this table, or the surface of that painting,
or the outer boundary of your heart or lungs. Recall our condition <i>4.</i>,
above, according to which each substance must possess its own complete,
connected boundary which divides its interior from its exterior. In condition
<i>7.</i>
we asserted that this boundary is established via a covering or membrane
which extends continuously across all or almost all of its extent. This
means that the boundary of a substance is a bona fide boundary for all
or almost all of its extent and that where the boundary falls short of
bona fide status this is because fiat boundaries are formed in virtue of
apertures in the shield or membrane, for example in the region of the mouth
or nostrils. To say that fiat boundaries are formed is to say simply that
the line between interior and exterior in the region of such apertures
corresponds to no physical discontinuity. (You can create a fiat boundary
of this sort, as a part of the total boundary of your office, by opening
your office door.) Siamese twins, which have a part of their surface (and
sometimes also certain organs) in common, are also separated by a fiat
boundary along the line where they meet.
<p>These remarks are important since categorial changes are closely connected
to topological changes - to changes in boundaries and in connectedness
- and such changes can be properly understood only if careful attention
is paid to the fiat/bona fide opposition (Smith and Varzi, forthcoming).
Two entities have the same topology, roughly speaking, if one can stretch,
bend, shrink or expand the one entity, without tearing or joining, in such
a way as to turn it into the second entity. Two entities will then have
the same topology if and only if they have, across their surface and interior,
analogous distributions of fiat and bona fide boundaries. A newly born
child has in most cases (Siamese twins provide exceptions) the same topology
when it is born as it does after it has turned six. A tail that is attached
to the body of a cat does not have the same topology as it would have if
it were detached from the cat: this is because before detachment its boundary
includes a fiat as well as a bona fide portion.
<p>Fiat boundaries are involved, now, whenever an organism undergoes a
process of division. As an amoeba splits its middle part becomes progressively
thinner so that we talk in terms of two halves of the amoeba with a fiat
boundary running within the interior of the amoeba between them. As the
middle part shrinks this fiat boundary separating the two halves then goes
out of existence, incrementally, until the point is reached when it disappears
entirely. A long, continuous process suddenly results in an abrupt topological
change. The right and left portions split, and we have two amoebae, each
with its own complete bona fide boundary.
<p>Fiat boundaries are involved, too, whenever one entity is strictly connected
to another (in the way in which, for example, the tail is strictly connected
to the remainder of the cat). The tenant-niche structure, as we saw, excludes
the possibility that tenant and niche may be strictly connected to each
other. Thus if the foster is connected to the mother - if, in other words,
the boundary between the foster and the mother is a matter of fiat and
not of bona fide boundaries - then the foster cannot stand to the mother
in the niche-tenant relation, and thus it cannot satisfy condition
<i>12</i>.
<p>But as we have seen, there is at no stage after ovulation a strict topological
connection between the foster and its mother. Such a connection is not
even established in the form of a canal through which blood or nutrients
might flow.<sup><a href="#N_16_"> (16)</a></sup> The communication taking
place between the foster and the mother involves many separate processes
of cell diffusion, but these processes occur always via some intervening
liquid-filled cavity; they never involves the presence of that sort of
common membrane or covering which would be required for strict topological
connection. It is for this reason that birth is most properly conceived
as the passage of an entity from one environment to another; it is analoguous
to John moving out of the spaceship.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>11. Is the Foster a Part of the Mother?</b>
<p>We are now in a position where we can address the question whether the
foster, upon the formation of the primitive streak, is a part of the mother,
or rather a tenant lodged within a niche inside the mother. Is the amniotic
cavity (the cavity created by the foster within the interior of the uterine
lining) itself a part of the mother? Or is it a genuine cavity, disjoint
from the mother, even though lying within her interior?
<p>If an entity is a proper part of a second substance which is a human
being, then it fails thereby to satisfy our condition <i>12.</i>, since
a tenant never shares parts in common with its niche. Suppose a tub of
yoghurt is inside a refrigerator. The yoghurt is then in the interior of
the refrigerator; but it is not a part of the refrigerator. Indeed it and
the refrigerator share no parts in common. Rather, it is lodged within
a cavity within the interior of the refrigerator, and it relates to the
refrigerator as a tenant to its niche. The refrigerator is one substance,
the tub of yoghurt is a second substance, and the former surrounds the
latter. Topologists distinguish in this connection between an object and
its convex closure (the latter is, intuitively, the result of filling all
the cavities within the former). If we say: the tub of yoghurt is inside
the refrigerator, then we really mean that its spatial location is a part
of the spatial location of the convex closure of the refrigerator. (Casati
and Varzi 1999)
<p>Consider the analogous case of the digestive tract. Is the digestive
tract a tunnel through your body, and thus a <i>hole</i>, or rather an
organ within your body and thus a
<i>part</i>? Certainly the throat, esophagus,
stomach, and colon are parts of the body as systems of cells. But the canal
which they together form is a genuine cavity, and thus not a part, since
its function is, like that of the mouth, to serve as a protected antechamber
which is able to withhold ingested substances from the body in order to
make it possible for the initial digestive processes to proceed. And so
also in the case of the complex of nested cavities in which the foster
is lodged.
<p>Certainly the foster is, from the stage at which the inner cell mass
is formed, a part of that substance which is the mereological sum of this
inner cell mass together with the trophoblastic cells and the blastocoel.
It is also a part of that circumcluding substance which is the mereological
sum of all of these together with the amniotic membrane and the fluid inside
the amniotic sac (the 'bag of waters'). And it is also a part of that even
more inclusive substance which is the mereological sum of all of these
together with the mother. The foster is thus a part of a whole which includes
the mother as part; but it is not a part of the mother. Rather, we can
now conclude, it is it occupies a niche within the interior of the mother
(in a way that is analogous to a body that is lodged within your digestive
tract). Thus the maximality condition (<i>12.</i>) is satisfied.<sup><a href="#N_17_">
(17)</a></sup>
<p>It is illuminating to consider the contrasting cases of the umbilical
cord and the placenta, for these two organs seem to satisfy many if not
all of the 12 conditions listed above, but they are clearly not human beings.
On closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that the umbilical cord
is a part of the foster in the same way in which a baby tooth is part of
a child. Thus it fails to meet our maximality condition (<i>12.</i>). The
placenta is more problematic; it has components from both the mother and
the foster and so contains both material and fetal DNA. However, as a result
of its maternal portion it is strictly topologically connected not to the
foster but to the mother, and so it, too, fails to meet condition <i>12.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>12. Stages in the Formation of the Human Substance</b>
<p>We can now give a more thorough account, in ontological terms, of the
multi-stage process by means of which the human individual is formed. The
single-cell zygote is formed via the unification of two separate substances:
the egg-cell and the sperm-nucleus. The parts of the zygote then undergo
a duplication within the cell and the topological connections between them
are disrupted in such a way that they come to constitute new substances
in their own right. These separate substances are now reunified into one
at the stage of the early blastocyst. A part of this one individual substance
is then detached from the remainder and forms a new individual substance
(namely the inner cell mass, or what will become the embryo) in a budding
process which involves the simultaneous creation of an interior cavity
in which what buds off then resides.
<p>At about the time of the formation of the primitive streak, the embryo
undergoes a process of unification or integration. This occurs through
the gradual formation of ties between the cells of the aggregate, through
the gradual development of a bona fide physical boundary marking out the
individual in space, and through the gradual process in virtue of which
groups of cells become successively determined to become tissues of specific
sorts in reflection of their specific relative locations within the developing
individual.
<p>Does it now follow that the human being is formed by degrees across
a temporal interval, an outcome which would carry a troubling implication
to the effect that different human beings might be human beings to different
degrees? To defeat this implication we need to show that the temporal interval
across which the mentioned unifying process takes place has some determinate
end-point, a bona fide temporal boundary, which we can then identify as
the instant at which the human being is formed. The nature of the change
which these unifying processes together brings about is to transform what
is actually one but potentially many into something that is both actually
and potentially one. Consider a collection of viscous bodies floating in
a liquid and combining freely together into larger wholes. Suppose that
there are chemical processes taking place inside one such viscous body
which serve to strengthen its exterior membrane by degrees. At some stage
in this gradual process a point will be reached where fusion with other
bodies is no longer possible. What is actually a whole but potentially
a mere part thereby becomes transformed, abruptly, into something that
is a whole both actually and potentially.
<p>We can now begin to understand how a collection of continuous processes
can give rise to an abrupt, categorial change. The unification processes
which take place in the foster with the formation of the primitive streak
together have the consequence that they bring about at some point an integration
of the foster that is strong enough to rule out the possibility of twinning.
They bring about a transformation from divisibility into non-divisibility.
The precise instant of this transformation cannot be ascertained from any
clearly visible external mark. Strong evidence for the thesis that the
change occurs within or about the period of the formation of the primitive
streak is however provided by noting the progressively more serious malformations
which arise when twinning occurs within this period. Such deformities,
as metallurgists who deal with stress in metals know, are characteristic
of abrupt topological change. They give us also extra reason to believe
that our account, here, of what it is to be a human being, is more than
a mere definitional or conceptual stipulation.
<p>Birnbacher (1995) has objected to such an identification of a time at
which the existence of a human individual begins by pointing out that all
natural change is continuous; that is, it happens molecule by molecule,
and millimeter by millimeter. Thus Birnbacher does not recognize any catastrophes
or discontinuities in the realm of natural processes. That Birnbacher is
wrong can be seen by moving from the case of temporal discontinuities to
their analogues in the spatial realm. We can take objects such as human
beings and move them from one place to another without effecting any topological
change; but we cannot do this with an entity that is two centimeters beneath
the surface of a human being's skin. Human beings have spatial boundaries
which are genuine discontinuities even in the face of the continuity of
matter in the physical world.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>13. The Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Being a Human Being:
An Excursus on Siamese Twins</b>
<p>It would be nice if we could specify not merely sufficient but also
necessary conditions for being a human being. Conditions <i>1.-12.</i>
will not serve this end (for individuals of human descent) because of counterexamples
in the family of Siamese twins.
<p>Most human beings are bounded spatially, and as in the case of other
substances their outer surface provides a bona fide boundary with the external
world. Not all entities have bona fide boundaries, however. Mountains,
valleys, and body parts have fiat boundaries also. The exceptional cases
among humans are provided by Siamese twins.
<p>Siamese twins may result when separation (twinning) occurs after day
10 and succeeds only partially. Siamese twins share as fosters a single
placenta, the outer membrane (chorion) and the inner membrane (amnion)
and the navel cord. Like identical twins, Siamese twins are the product
of a single ovum which splits and forms two centers of organization (two
primitive streaks) which lie close together. When these expand and differentiate,
they do not divide properly, but fuse and then continue development.
<p>There are many degrees and kinds of connectedness of Siamese twins.
There are Siamese twins with only one head. These arise for example, when
one parasitic cotwin without a head is attached to a part (the autosite)
of the twin, for example to his stomach (<i>heteroadelphi</i> or asymmetrical
connection; from the<i> </i>Greek <i>adelphi</i>: brothers). The parasite
may even be located inside a cavity in the autosite. This is called 'fetal
inclusion', and it usually happens after the fusion of the growing embryos
(upon the formation of their respective primitive streaks). One embryo
is completely surrounded by the other, and the development of the included
embryo is delayed. <i>Heteroadelphi</i> may also result in a tumor-like
entity which if not removed is present in the adult, who comprehends a
cavity containing a perfectly structured, dead miniature human fetus.
<p>There are other double formations which result in a single individual
with only one head which are characterized by a symmetrical development.
These are called '<i>teratoadelphi</i>' (upper connection). The <i>teratoadelphus</i>
is typically a Siamese twin with one head and body and four legs some of
which can be rudimentary.
<p>It is Siamese twins with two heads and marked by a symmetrical development
which are of interest to us here. These involve independent sensory systems
which are controlled by their respective brains. The prototype of such
Siamese twins are the
<i>teratopagi</i> (central connection; from the Greek,
<i>pagi</i>:
anything that fastens). The twins can here be connected at the stomach
or at other parts of the body. They may even be connected at the upper
part of the cranium; but they always have two brains which are independent
of each other.
<p><i>Teratodymi</i> (lower connection; from the Greek, <i>dymi: </i>two
out of one) have two heads and two spinal cords, but only one body, and
one set of legs and arms. They may also have two hearts.
<p>Siamese twins of the latter types are important for our purposes because
they constitute one single substance but two relatively isolated causal
systems. They are one substance because a part of their external bona fide
boundary is completely shared and thus they are strongly connected topologically.
There is only one single connected surface, even through some portions
of this surface are claimed only by one of the two constituent members
of the whole. That they are two causal systems arises in virtue of a partial
separation via bona fide boundaries around their respective upper torsos,
together with the independent or partially independent circulatory systems.
<p>How, now, are we to amend our twelve conditions in such a way as to
provide necessary conditions for human beings which will admit relevant
types of Siamese twins? Siamese twins are two distinct human beings if
they have two distinct brains and so can respond independently to the environment.
Siamese twins are a problematic case exactly for this reason; they are
two distinct human individuals and yet they fail to satisfy criterion <i>7.</i>
above. They are therefore more like a limb attached to a body than a substance
which has a bona fide boundary of its own. We can, however, amend our twelve
conditions by making an exception for human beings who are connected via
their outermost parts such as their skin or via organs other than the brain.
<p>The necessary and sufficient conditions for an entity to be a human
individual can then be formulated as follows:
<p><i>x </i>is a human being <i>if and only if</i>
<p>(i) <i>x </i>is of human descent
<p>and either
<p>(ii) <i>x </i>satisfies conditions <i>1.-12.</i>
<p>or
<p>(iii) <i>x</i> is a part of some whole <i>y</i> which satisfies conditions
<i>1.-9.</i>,
and <i>x</i> is a relatively isolated system in its own right in the sense
that it contains its own mechanisms or procedures to maintain or restore
stability, and <i>x </i>is non-divisible (it satisfies condition
<i>11.</i>)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>14. How to Refute Our Argument</b>
<p>To refute our argument it would be necessary to show that one or more
of the following assumptions is false:
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(i) Clauses<i> 1.-12. </i>specify sufficient conditions for being a
human being when applied to the products of human reproduction.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(ii) A human being is an entity which maintains its identity across
time from the beginning to the end of its existence.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iii) The beginning of the existence of a human individual constitutes
a genuine temporal boundary.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(iv) The foster satisfies condition<i> 12.</i>, which means that it
is not a part of the mother, but rather related to her as a tenant to its
niche.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(v) The single-cell zygote is a substance and a relatively isolated
system, and it is maximal,<i> </i>but it cannot be identical with the human
being because it ceases to exist through fission almost immediately after
it has been formed. Thus it fails condition
<i>11.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(vi) The multi-cell zygote, the morula, the inner cell mass and the
epiblast likewise fail condition <i>11.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(vii) At the end of the formation of the primitive streak, the foster
has become a single relatively isolated causal system for which twinning
is no longer possible.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(viii) Thus, at the end of the formation of the primitive streak, the
foster for the first time satisfies conditions<i> 1.-12.</i> in a way which
would make it a candidate to be identical to the human being which exists
after birth.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>(ix) By the arguments under <i>g.</i>-<i>i.</i> above, there is no later
time at which the foster or child undergoes any further substantial change.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Conclusion: The existence of a human individual begins upon the formation
of the primitive streak (at around day 16).

According to Aquinas the fetus acquires a human soul at about 40 days for
males and 90 days for females. <i>In Petri Lombardi Quartuor Sententiarum:

distinguished from both weak and strong external connection. Weak external
connection obtains, intuitively, when two topologically closed entities
touch: the cat and the mat are externally connected when the cat is on
the mat. (To say that an object is topologically closed is to say that
it includes a complete bona fide exterior boundary as part.) The strong
form of external connection arises when one open object, for example a
body of air, is in contact with a closed object, for example the walls
of a glass container.

to a parasite which occupies a host organism. Fosters, like parasites,
are functionally dependent on their host organisms; they are both substances
and causal systems which are not part of their host organism but are rather
related to them as a tenant to a niche. Just as human beings will often
react against parasites by producing antibodies, so the mother initially
reacts to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies. But
the trophoblast surrounding the early embryo blocks the action of these
antibodies so that the embryo is not rejected from the mother's body. One
difference between the foster and a parasite in respect to our present
argument is that the parasite is not made of human DNA.</blockquote>
