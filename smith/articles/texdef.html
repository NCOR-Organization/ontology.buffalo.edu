							</b><br>It is a truism that the attitude of <i>deference to the text</i> plays a
lesser role in Anglo-Saxon philosophy than in other philosophical traditions. 
Works of philosophy written in English have, it is true, spawned a massive 
secondary literature dealing with the ideas, problems or arguments they contain.
But they have almost never given rise to works of <i>commentary</i> in the
strict sense, a genre which is however a dominant literary form not only
in the Confucian, Vedantic, Islamic, Jewish and Scholastic traditions of
the past, but also in relation to more recent German-language philosophy (thus
for example in work on Hegel, Heidegger or Wittgenstein). Moreover Anglo-Saxon
philosophers have themselves embraced the commentary form when dealing with
Greek or Latin philosophers outside their own tradition. The paper seeks
to establish the reasons for this imbalance by examining those factors which
might be conducive to the growth of a commentary literature in a given culture.

					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>It is one of those unexamined commonplaces of the history of philosophy that
the <i>commentary</i> enjoyed a central role in the literature of philosophy
in both the classical and medieval periods. Something similar holds, too,
of Confucian, Syriac, Byzantine, Jewish, Arabic, Indian, Japanese and Korean
philosophy, as also of the philosophy of the Renaissance, so that many thousands
of commentaries have been written by philosophers on Chinese, Greek, Arabic,
Hebrew, Latin and Sanskrit texts. Thinkers such as Kant, Hegel, Marx and
Heidegger have likewise called forth a substantial commentary literature
on German-language writings, and the same applies too, though to a lesser
extent, in relation to Descartes and the philosophy of the French. Anglo-Saxophone
philosophy, on the other hand, seems to enjoy in this respect an exceptional
position. For where English-language philosophers have utilized the commentary
form in systematic ways, this seems in every case to have reflected a concern
with one or other of the more textually oriented traditions mentioned above
(and especially with the Greek and German). Works of English philosophy since
Locke seem for their part to have given rise to no significant commentary
literature whatsoever.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a> </sup>Thus it is significant that where Kemp Smith wrote a 
					<i>Commentary
on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason</i> (1918), treating this text as a unitary
and coherent whole, his <i>Philosophy of David Hume</i> (1941) takes the
form rather of a `Critical Study' of the `Origins and Central Doctrines'
of Hume's philosophy. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Why, then, should what has elsewhere proved so vital a plant in the literature
of philosophy have to this degree failed to take root among philosophers
working in the Anglo-Saxon mainstream? Providing an answer to this question
will help us first of all to construct a new sort of tunnel through the history
of philosophy. More importantly for present purposes, however, it will throw
light upon the current geographical polarization of the discipline of philosophy
in a way which will raise issues of wider, contemporary relevance. <br>&nbsp; 
					</font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">What is a commentary?</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>An adequate answer to the question as to the nature of the commentary is
almost impossible, given the immense breadth and diversity of the commentary 
literature itself and given also the still partial and inadequate nature of
its scholarly treatment.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a> </sup>What follows must therefore necessarily consist in little more than
half-supported generalizations. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Commentaries, glosses, scholia, exegeses, postils,
					<i>adnotationes</i>
, <i>animadversiones</i>, <i>explicationes</i>, <i>enarrationes</i>, <i>expositiones</i>
 may be said to lie on a continuum between original text (or translation)
on the one hand and purely interpretative works (works of secondary literature
as nowadays standardly conceived) on the other. The focal instances of the 
genre for example the `long' Aristotle-commentaries of Averroes deal with 
their respective object-texts line-for-line or paragraph-for-paragraph, and
they are distinguished from purely interpretative works by the fact that
their central axes are built out of actual segments of the text itself. </font>
					</p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Where a commentary is of its nature oriented around the text of some 
given object work, a work of secondary literature is standardly oriented around
ideas and arguments, the latter conceived at what may be some distance from
their specific original formulations. The commentary may, certainly, deal
with the arguments of its object text. But it will follow an order of exposition
that is determined not, in the first place, by the content of these arguments,
but rather by the order of the text itself, and it will strive to do justice
to this text as a unitary object to be taken as a whole. A work of secondary
literature, in contrast, will treat its object atomistically, as a source
to be mined at will. Naturally there are critical and polemical writings
of various sorts which fall between these two extremes. Indeed it has to
be stressed that we are dealing, here, with a complex multi-dimensional spectrum
of cases, in relation to which our present efforts at taxonomy are provisional
only, but perhaps not, for that reason, worthless. <br>&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">Types of commentary</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>A commentary arises most commonly out of the seminar, i.e. out of some student's
study, under the teacher's direction, of an important text, and a remark
to this effect is standard fare in those textbooks of the history of philosophy
which treat of the genres of philosophical literature. Such commentaries
are made for private, scholarly purposes, and indeed it may be assumed that
all students of philosophy are responsible for more or less fragmentary writings
of this sort. Here, however, we are concerned primarily not with private
but with public (or published) commentaries,<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a> </sup>though we do of course recognize that the distinction in question
here made itself felt only slowly, so that the background of school philosophy 
will not be incidental to our story. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The public commentary is, we might say, a device which enables the transmission 
of the textual force or content of an object text from one age or culture 
or group to another. Thus for example the commentary may be an attempt to
make something perspicuous and accessible out of, or to reveal the underlying 
system hidden behind material that is otherwise dispersed and inaccessible, 
material that exists, perhaps, only in the form of superficially unconnected 
parts or fragments. Where the object-text is itself the master text of a
religion or race, the commentary may be said to aid in the understanding and
fixing of a wider cultural legacy, essentially by surmounting difficulties 
of interpretation such as are created, for example, by the antiquity and importance
(holy or venerable character) of its object. In some instances the commentary
may be turned against an object of this sort. Thus scholarly commentaries
on Confucian writings were commissioned by the Chinese authorities in the
period of the Cultural Revolution as a means of discrediting the Confucian
ideas still exerting a hold on the population at large. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">A work of commentary is normally the responsibility of an author distinct 
from the author of the original text. But there are also self-commentaries, 
for example the <i>Convivio</i> of Dante. The Bible, too, contains elements 
of self-commentary (see e.g. Neh. 8:8), as also does Homer,<sup><a href="#N_4_">
(4)</a> </sup>and Mandeville's <i>Fable of the Bees</i>. Self-commentary survives
not least in our present footnotes, which are direct descendants of the marginal 
glosses (`scholia') of the tradition. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Occasionally a work of commentary may itself be of such importance that 
it gives rise to a second-order commentary literature of its own (for example 
in the case of Boethius' commentary to the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyrius, or
of the glossings of the <i>Gloss</i> which dominated Bible-exegesis throughout
the later Middle Ages). Commentaries may in addition relate not only to entire
works but also to single sentences.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a> </sup>Or indeed they may relate to individual words: the first dictionaries
took the form of collections of glosses to difficult words in Homer. Wittgenstein's 
  					<i>Tractatus</i> can be seen in this light as having been built up out
of chains of self-commentaries (glosses on glosses), in which the commentary-structure
has been deliberately left exposed. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Commentaries are of course made not only to philosophical works but also
to works of religion and theology, to poetical and scientific works and to
the various codes of secular and canon law. Indeed one signal advantage of
the approach to be advanced below, is that it will reveal natural interconnections 
between areas of human activity too often treated in isolation. Above all 
it will help to remind us of the truism that the disciplines of law, theology, 
philosophy and medicine were initially much more closely connected than is
the case today. Thus it is no accident that Averroes (`the Commentator') was
at one and the same time physician, `philosopher of Islam' and High Court
Judge. Elements of the scholastic method in theology and philosophy may indeed
have been derived from models taken over from the Islamic legal tradition.
The latter was marked especially by the fact that, because Islam lacked councils
or synods, it had to depend on a principle of consensus in order to define
its legal and doctrinal orthodoxy, in a process which worked retroactively: 
  					</font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Each generation cast its glance backward to the generations that preceded 
it to see whether or not a certain doctrine had gained acceptance through 
consensus; and this was decided by the absence of a dissenting voice among 
the doctors of the law regarding that doctrine.</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a>
					</font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Legal commentaries are themselves a means of fixing the correct (`orthodox') 
interpretation of the sentences of a legal code, sentences which must of necessity
be formulated by means of general terms whose concrete application to specific
cases is not capable of being fixed <i>a priori</i> by the legislator. The
job of the glossator or commentator is, therefore, that of trying to establish
the `dominant opinion' among the authorities originally the `<i>communis
opinio doctorum</i>' as to the correct interpretation of paragraphs of the
code that have been exposed as problematic.</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a>
					</font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">And there are of course also philological commentaries, a genre that 
originated with the Alexandrians at a time when there is, as Geffcken puts 
it, a `veritable commentary-atmosphere abroad'.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a>
					</sup>In the Renaissance, too, there was cultivated the practice of philological 
commentary. This was first of all for purely linguistic reasons. The goal 
was to make once more manifest the classical linguistic norms of Greek or
of `Golden Latin' by exhibiting the original classical texts in the purest
possible form. But the humanists wanted the new sort of precision in the
fixing of the text to serve also practical goals. They wanted to reconstitute
not only the language but also the `wisdom' of the ancients, in all its breadth.
Thus it was especially in the Renaissance that there arose a systematic commentary
literature around scientific texts, and we have the example of the Renaissance
`iatrophilologists', who sought to further medical science by writing philological
commentaries on the medical and botanical writings of the ancients.<sup><a href="#N_9_">
(9)</a> </sup><br>&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">Why do commentaries arise?</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>Commentaries grow up around a given work, crudely and trivially speaking, 
because it has become necessary to make this work more easily accessible. 
This is normally for a plurality of reasons, not all of them strictly philosophical. 
Commentaries will arise first of all because of the density or impenetrability 
of a given work. But they will arise also because a text is too remote, or
too short, or too aphoristic, or too fragmentarily preserved for immediate 
understanding. Thus the texts of English-language philosophy have been spared
the hand of philological commentary not least because they are normally available
as a matter of course in complete and uncorrupted forms. And commentaries
have been made to Wittgenstein's writings (almost all of which were of course
written in German) not because Wittgenstein employs in his philosophy a difficult
language, but because it is necessary to create the context and interconnections,
and thereby to offer a coherent reading, of the thoughts expressed. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">In a commentary, as we saw, the words of the text are typically presented 
ostensively; they are transmitted to the reader in a way that is designed 
to bring him closer to this text itself. And this means that commentaries 
as such will arise where the very words of a text enjoy their own intrinsic 
importance (as divinely inspired, for example, or as constituents of an age-old
esoteric ritual or legal ordinance). We might refer to this as the hagiographic
dimension of the commentary literature, recognizing thereby that there are
different sorts of veneration or respect for an author which are able to
justify in felicitous circumstances the expenditure of exceptional effort
in grappling with the difficulties of his text. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">It is understandable in this light why commentaries should have been 
so often produced in relation to works that are possessed of some national 
or religious significance, works that are seen as contributing to the founding 
or to the cultural integrity or exclusivity or to the moral training of a
given society and which may have come to enjoy official recognition as such.
Consider for example the way in which Magna Carta has been appealed to over
and over again by the English in time of national crisis `as a fundamental
law too sacred to be altered as a talisman containing some magic spell, capable
of averting national calamity'.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a> </sup>It is more than anything else the fact that works of philosophy
have enjoyed to some degree the role of master texts in certain cultures
that accounts for the fact that the discipline of philosophy itself is taken
seriously in those cultures, both by its practitioners and also by a wider
public. (It goes without saying that philosophy is not taken seriously, in
this sense, in the Anglo-Saxon world.) </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The master texts are often distinguished further by special mnemotechnical 
powers, reflecting the fact that they arose at a pre-literate stage of social
evolution, when the only available verbal technology for the preservation 
and fixation of ideas and values in transmission was that of the rhythmic 
word.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a> </sup>For these and other reasons the given texts may give rise both to
special difficulties of interpretation and also to a special linguistic fascination.
Indeed, their powers in this respect may extend far into the future, as is
seen, for example, in the way in which ancient Greek and Latin texts are
still able to exert a hold upon us even today. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The established master texts are distinguished also by their breadth 
or universality. This is most clearly seen in the case of Homer (`from whom
all men have learned since the beginning'), who was responsible for establishing
that common Greek language which allowed the whole Greek people for the first
time to feel its unity, in spite of all differences of race and class. Homer
served as a veritable national encyclopedia, the source of instruction not
only in a range of administrative and other skills but also in ethics. The
practices of law and politics in Greek society relied to such an extent on
the training which Homer supplied, that his work acquired an institutional
status and its dissemination and explication was granted state support.</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_12_">
(12)</a> </font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The Bible, too, is possessed of a universality of this sort: it constitutes, 
as it were, a divine encyclopedia that is written in cipher (so that St. Jerome,
for example, could claim in the prologue to his commentary on the Book of
Isaiah that this latter work comprised the whole of physics, ethics and logic<sup><a href="#N_13_">
(13)</a> </sup>). And similarly Confucius, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, and indeed
the <i>Corpus iuris civilis</i> played a central role in providing master
texts for their respective cultures, each with pretensions to universality,
and each giving rise to a veritable forest of commentaries on the part of
successive generations of scholars. So intimate was the connection between
master text and commentary that the poet Gower, when setting out to produce,
in his <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, `a bok for Engelondes sake', was careful
to supply the work with its own (anonymous) scholarly apparatus of glosses
and summaries and with a long preface designed to resemble the prologue to
a Scriptural commentary.</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a>
					</font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">What is important for our purposes, now, is that philosophers, too, have
sought repeatedly in the course of history to usurp in their writings the
role of the Homeric encyclopedia. It is this albeit via much intermediation 
which accounts for the desire still alive especially in Germany to extend 
one's philosophizing across the entire available breadth of philosophy in
the way that this was done for example by Aristotle or Kant or Hegel.<sup><a href="#N_15_">
(15)</a> </sup>And it accounts also for the desire on the part of certain contemporary 
philosophers to imitate in their own writings aspects of the style and hermetic
character of the older master texts to produce, in other words, works which
will have the power to call forth a commentary literature of their own. (This
desire, too, is absent from the world of Anglo-Saxon philosophy.) </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">A prime text may enjoy further not merely a cultural but also an evidential 
status, so that commentaries may arise in reflection of the fact that certain 
texts come to be awarded a role in the evaluation and accreditation of philosophical
or scientific theses. The medieval term <i>auctor</i> signified someone who
deserved not merely to be read but also to be respected and believed; his
writings possessed <i>auctoritas</i> in this sense; they were compiled out
of profound sayings worthy of imitation. Scholars did not in these circumstances
attempt to compete with their <i>auctores</i>. They sought rather to understand
and to interpret and to reproduce for themselves the authority of their texts. 
  					</font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The frequent incidence of acknowledged or unacknowledged quotations from
other writings in medieval works is an external sign of the role of tradition
and <i>auctoritas</i> in the science of the day, something which reflects
in turn the fact that currently favoured empirical methods for scientific
evaluation were not, as yet, available, or not sufficiently entrenched.<sup><a href="#N_16_">
(16)</a> </sup>Still at this stage and even for example in the work of Su&aacute;rez,
who was the first to write a work of metaphysics that is not a commentary
on Aristotle the opinion of the individual scientist acquires validity only
to the extent that it can be shown to be supported by the prevailing opinion
among the <i>auctores</i>. Thus the scientist's job is to assemble a representative
selection of experts or authorities in a way that will establish the compatibility
with tradition of the view he favours. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Even leaving aside the case of Marxist philosophy, where the agreement 
of an author with the very word of Marx or Engels or Lenin was once deemed 
to count as evidence for the correctness of what he had to say, the rule of
coherence with general scientific opinion has not lost its hold entirely as
a method of validation. No longer, however, is this rule taken to imply that
the scientist must cast what he has to say in the form of interpretations 
of theses already formulated by earlier masters; and no longer is it the case
that the reputation of a scientist is a function of the number and breadth
of the <i>auctores</i> he himself is in a position to cite. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Of course not all commentaries reflect either hagiography or slavish 
adherence to tradition. Especially with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the
11th century there arises a new sort of scientific and critical mentality, 
so that Aquinas can affirm (in his commentary on Aristotle's <i>De caelo et
mundo</i>) that `the study of philosophy does not have the goal of knowing 
what men have thought but of knowing what is the truth of things'. Some commentators
thereafter treat established texts merely as decorative vehicles for the
transmission of their own ideas. Some commentaries, on the other hand, are
written precisely in order to demonstrate the importance of a work hitherto
dismissed on all sides as unimportant. Each of these forms is, however, capable
of arising and surviving only against the background of a commentary tradition
of a hagiographical or exegetical sort. Moreover, even the writing of hagiographic
commentaries is not of necessity incompatible with the expounding of new
and critical ideas. Already in Jewish and Eastern Christian commentary much
criticism is allowed, though only if the code is superficially adhered to.
Thus for example one may never say an authority is wrong or inconsistent,
but rather for example that he is `metaphorical' or `difficult to understand'.
In this way there may be effected an infiltration of new ideas, though these
must never be announced as such. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Something similar holds, too, of medieval Indian philosophy, where the 
practice of writing commentaries had arisen in reflection of the seeming incomprehensibility
of the religious texts that had served as the starting point of philosophical
reflection. The resulting commentaries serve thereafter as the expression
of a strongly systematized conformism that is however sometimes only superficial.
As in much of scholastic philosophy, so in India, too, there prevails the
custom `that no individual can claim to have seen the truth for the first
time and, therefore, that an individual can only explicate, state, and defend
in a new form a truth that had been seen, stated, and defended by countless
others before him.'<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a> </sup>The novice philosopher, accordingly, must first affiliate himself
to one or other of the established systems. To be admitted as a master he
must then write a commentary on the stras of this system, or a sub-commentary 
on one of the existing commentaries, and so on. And while a person may at
any stage introduce a new point of view, `at no stage can he claim originality 
for himself. Not even an author of the stras could do that, for he was only
systematizing the thoughts and insights of countless predecessors.'<sup><a href="#N_18_">
(18)</a> </sup><br>&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">Six conditions</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>We can, in light of the above, list the following conditions for the appearance
of commentaries around a given text in a given culture: <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; 
					</font></p>
					<ul>
						<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">i. The text must enjoy a certain density or inaccessibility or seeming incompleteness
or foreignness, so that it is not readily understandable to all. </font></p>
						<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">ii. The language of the text must serve in this culture as the object 
of a special intrinsic fascination. </font></p>
						<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">iii. The exact words of the author must be of importance as such (it 
must for some reason be seen as worthwhile to grapple with the difficulties 
posed by these very words). </font></p>
						<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">iv. The text must enjoy a certain cultural or national or religious 
significance in its own right. (This is sometimes at one remove, where a
minor text inherits significance from its author, or is granted retrospectively 
a special historical significance, for example because its language is no
longer known, or is known only partially.) </font></p>
						<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">v. The text is possessed of a certain universal or encyclopedic character. 
    					</font></p>
						<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">vi. Tradition or authority are treated in the given culture as a principal 
court of appeal in the evaluation of scientific or other sorts of assertions. 
    					<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;</font></p>
					</ul>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">These conditions are dispositional only: that is, they are intended to serve
as a guide as to when and where we might expect a (public) commentary literature
to arise. The six conditions are in addition not independent. On the contrary,
it is our contention that they map interconnecting aspects of a single underlying
structure. This is seen for example in the fact that, where the texts most
characteristic of post-Lockean English-language philosophy satisfy none of
the listed conditions, the most important texts of mainstream German philosophy
satisfy them all.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a> </sup>In relation to other cultures, too, the six conditions can be seen
to be closely linked. Consider the results of applying them to the case of,
say, the Talmud, the Koran, or the American Constitution. 
  </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">Origins and development of the commentary culture</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>It was the duty of the rhapsodes in Ancient Greece not only to recite but
also to explain Homer. The first commentaries were in this sense quite literally
inextricable from the text which served as their object. Indeed the roots
of the commentary tradition reach far back into the time of oral culture,
when philosophy (science) is perforce not a body of fixed doctrine which
can be treated as it were impersonally and from without, but rather, again,
a serious business of mnemotechnics, designed to bring about the training
of the minds who will serve as the carriers of the doctrine into the future.
The new-fangled chicanery of `writing' must initially appear from this perspective
to be of secondary importance, if not as positively dangerous. Thus as the
possibly spurious 7th Letter of Plato has it: `no serious man will ever think
of writing about serious realities for the general public'. And `when anyone
sees anywhere the written work of anyone, whether that of a lawgiver in his
laws or whatever it may be in some other form, the subject treated cannot
have been his most serious concern' (344 c). </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Again and again Plato criticizes the Sophists for the exaggerated respect 
which they demonstrated for the written word. Such an attitude, as Plato conceived
matters, </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">was bound to weaken or even to destroy physical memory, on which the 
whole oral tradition of the past was based, and in the end would be a threat 
to true philosophy, which needs the personal intercourse of the dialectician 
to plant the living word in the soul of the listener.</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_20_">
(20)</a> </font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">True and serious philosophy, from this perspective, can take place only 
within the compass of a school, and a school is initially defined precisely 
by the fact that its members accept a common authority (Pythagoras, Plato, 
Aristotle, Thomas, Scotus), and thereafter a common text as standard work 
for study. And now it seems clear that commentary as public genre, and especially
the commentary public of the philosophers, has vital roots also in this textual
orientation of the schools. Indeed, to belong to a school, in the Middle
Ages, means precisely to be engaged in the attempt to grasp the meaning of
just <i>these</i> texts, so that the work of the school becomes intrinsically
connected to the making of commentaries. This holds of Thomas or Scotus,
too simply because they were university professors endowed with the task
of conveying and explaining successive portions of the relevant master texts
in easily memorable form as appropriate to a time when books (which is to
say manuscripts) were still rare and memory still powerful. The schools may
be marked further by an opposition between two kinds of writing, the esoteric
`inner writings', which will contain the properly important doctrines and
formulations, and more popular writings directed to the `outside'. While
the surviving works of Plato seem to be in the main such popular `outer'
writings (reflecting Plato's view that a person is only `playing' when he
writes), those of Aristotle are rather internal <i>logoi</i> of a school.
As Owens puts it in relation to Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics</i>: `In general,
the style and technique of the Books have not the character of writings ever
intended to be "published," in the sense of being directed to an undetermined
public.'<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a> </sup>Rather, they must be interpreted in relation to definite school
activity. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">For this reason, too, students of philosophy will require the assistance 
of commentaries as their distance increases from the original masters of their
respective schools. With the growth in size of the accredited master literature
there come to be required also synoptic compendia of the sort illustrated
by the <i>libri sententiarum</i> of Isidore of Seville or Peter of Lombardy.
These are compilations of quotations from the Church Fathers and other <i>auctores</i>, organized systematically rather than according to the Scriptural
order that had initially prevailed. Principally, however, they are a teaching
device, reflecting the practices current in institutions of learning in the
Middle Ages and later. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">And similarly, when once Wittgenstein himself is no longer available 
to explain the meaning and connection of his gnomic sayings, commentaries 
and epitomes begin to be produced on his thought. Leaving aside this very 
special case, however, the commentary-tradition is not to be found within 
the world of English-speaking philosophy: philosophers writing in the English 
language were never marked by the desire to produce texts worthy of commentary, 
and philosophers working within this tradition are not affected by the idea
that its texts might properly serve as the objects of commentary. This is
at least in part because this philosophy was initiated by thinkers who wanted
to break with what they regarded as out-moded practices of the past. In England,
as (initially) on the continent, the `new philosophy' came to be oriented
not around schools and school texts, but around ideas, arguments and problems.
Thus commentaries were not written upon Hume and Berkeley not least because
as contrasted with the case of, say, the Lombard, or Aquinas (or Shakespeare,
or Milton) their writings were never put to use as texts for schoolboys. </font>
					</p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">It would be wrong, however, to conceive the revolution which was effected 
by the contemporaries of Gassendi and Locke a revolution which can be seen, 
  <i>anno regni derridanae</i>, to have enjoyed a lasting philosophical success
only in the Anglo-Saxon countries as consisting simply in the positive transition 
to something new. As Duhem and others have shown, philosophers had begun much
earlier to think in terms of the new, visual and scientific orientation. Both
Nicholas of Autrecourt and Telesio had conceived knowledge as flowing exclusively
from the senses. But such thinkers continued at the same time to embrace
the old reliance (be it hagiographical or critical) on tradition. The essence
of the Gassendian-Lockean revolution was, rather, negative: it consisted
in the very fact that a philosophical culture was born in which the writing
of commentaries had no place. <br>&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">A new map of philosophy</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>It is a simple matter to imagine a map of philosophy wherein the positional 
value of a philosopher is determined by the number of commentaries written
upon his works, connections between one philosopher and his successors being 
established in turn by the degree to which the latter are responsible for 
commentaries on the former. The largest node on this map will be occupied 
almost certainly by Aristotle, the master of all who know, descended from 
whom is also the largest number of further nodes. The authors of the Vedas 
and Upanishads, too, will enjoy prominent positions on the map, as also will
Porphyrius, Augustine, Boethius and Thomas. Kant, Hegel, Marx, Wittgenstein 
and Heidegger are medium-sized points. English and American philosophers, 
with the possible exception of Locke, do not appear on the map at all. </font>
					</p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">To make sense of all the available connections the map must include not
only philosophers but also poets, grammarians, jurists, theologians, and
many others in a way which does justice to the actual historical relations 
of philosophy and its sister-disciplines. When this is done, then we find 
that one of the most important positions on the map is occupied by the already
mentioned theologian Peter Lombard, whose compilation, the <i>Libri quattuor
sententiarum</i>, enjoys a quite special place in virtue of the fact that
the preparation of a commentary on this work had in 1222 been made compulsory
for all candidates reading for the Bachelor of Theology an edict taking in
such luminaries as Aquinas, Bonaventure, Scotus, Ockham, Aureol, Gregory
of Rimini and countless others. This was not because of any special literary
excellence of the text itself; rather, Lombard's <i>Sentences</i>, as a non-controversial
compendium of all major problems, served as a definitive source of philosophical-theological
five-finger exercises for successive generations of students. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The map is instructive also in giving us a direct indication of the ways
in which philosophical authors were taken up and supported by different secular
and religious powers in the course of history. And the map implies also a
new view of the geography of contemporary philosophy. For where all philosophers,
whether Jewish, Christian, Chinese, Islamic or Indian, were once united (albeit
unwittingly) in a common endeavour centred on the striving to interpret (and
criticize and extrapolate beyond) some core of master texts, philosophers
today are in this respect divided into two opposing camps. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">On the one side we have what might be called the philosophical commentary 
cultures of Germany, France and Italy, where philosophers (leaving aside a
small number of fifth columnists from the analytic camp) continue to respect
(albeit in different ways) the older textually oriented habits of the tradition.
Here philosophers are typically governed by the idea that philosophy must
be something earnest and profound, and they are accustomed to the idea that
philosophical texts ought properly to employ a complicated and hermetic language. 
  					</font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">On the other side (and as it were off the map entirely) we have what 
are philosophically speaking the non-commentary cultures of contemporary England
and her former Colonial Territories, of Scandinavia, Poland and Austria,
where philosophy or at least the philosophical mainstream lacks this textual
orientation and training. Here the writings of philosophers are marked by
a kind of easy superficiality of style that might earlier and elsewhere have
been dismissed as unphilosophical. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Where, as we have seen, the tradition of schools and masters was in England
abandoned for good already at around the time of Locke, this tradition was
reinstituted in Germany in the 19th century and has been continued without
interruption ever since. In France it seems to have been rekindled only in
the last decades (reflecting in part a dependence of much contemporary French
philosophy on German models), and after a long interregnum of philosophy of
a non-textually oriented sort. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The differences here arose for a variety of reasons, some of them religious 
and political. Thus English (and American) philosophy since Locke has been 
a markedly democratic affair in the sense that successive generations of philosophers
have looked, not in veneration to earlier masters, but to fellow philosophers
addressed as equals in a spirit of continued discussion. (English <i>literature</i>
, on the other hand, where other standards and traditions prevail, has been
able to preserve that sort of veneration and respect in face of the text
against the background of which the writing of commentaries is able to flourish.) 
  					</font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The commentary orientation of German philosophy, at least, is to no small
part a result of the fact that the philosophy of the Germans has been always,
in the Middle Ages as also in the modern era, a product of the universities.
Not only the orientation around texts was inherited by the German philosophers,
but also many of the practices associated therewith, above all as concerns
the striving for a universal or encyclopedic philosophy, the formation of
schools and of ortho- and heterodoxies. Even Kant gave lectures in the form
of commentaries (he never gave a course on his own philosophy), and lectures
of this sort (normally unpublished) have been the statutorily imposed form
in modern German universities until far into the 19th century.<sup><a href="#N_22_">
(22)</a> </sup>German philosophy has been further affected by the legacy of the
idea an idea that was at least inspired by Kant and Hegel, and which is nowadays
accepted as a matter of course in most of continental Europe to the effect
that there are, in theoretical philosophy, no truths in themselves to which
we can gain access, but only thoughts of people. Thus to do philosophy is
not to seek the truth, or to seek arguments and evidence in favour of what
one holds to be the truth; rather it is to write the history of what people
have thought as this is revealed precisely in the slowly growing stream of
canonical texts. Philosophy and history of philosophy become hereby identified.
In some circles this has led to historical and philological work of the highest 
order; in others (and increasingly) it has degenerated into a treatment of
texts that is purely literary. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The role of the student of philosophy in a culture such as this is a 
largely passive one: the beginning philosopher is taught that it is most proper
for him to <i>philosophize through</i> the master-philosophers of the past,
for only thus will he be able fully to immerse himself in the ever-growing
stream of canonical texts; the active give-and-take of philosophical exchange
takes place thereby not between teacher and student, but at third hand: between
text and commentator-lecturer. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Of course contemporary philosophy in the Anglo-Saxon countries, too, 
is a creature of the universities; it would be wrong, however, to neglect 
the consequences of the fact that the most important philosophical movements 
among philosophers writing in English grew up precisely against the resistance 
of established schools and organs. Serious philosophical training in these 
countries is, at least ideally, centred not on lectures but on seminars and
tutorials which imply an active give-and-take between students and teachers.
The activity of philosophizing is therefore learned, in the small, through
the practice of discussion and argument. And then it is not texts holistically
conceived, but individual ideas, puzzles and arguments which take centre
stage. On the other hand however it means also that the student reads little
that is deep, or is such as to enjoy an extended shelf-life, so that the
breadth of philosophizing in its classical forms, of a sort that was earlier
transmitted through close (and obligatory) study of the masters, is normally
eluded. </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">The most prominent Anglo-Saxon philosophies in the present century have 
indeed freed themselves, step by step, from residual literary, historical 
and philological associations of their discipline in favour of an alliance 
with formal logic. Hence the seeming paradox that the philosophy of linguistic 
analysis has normally not dared to allow itself any special (for example aesthetic)
fascination with language itself.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a> </sup>Dominant, instead, have been variants of the idea, mined out of
Plato via Frege, of a realm of propositions conceived as a repository of
fixed, objective meanings, each capable of being unproblematically captured
in the framework of a precisely governed syntax. It is clear why this idea,
even in its more sophisticated later variant forms, should have proved unconducive 
to the expenditure of great effort in the reading and understanding of difficult
texts. And it is clear also why it should have implied a rejection of that
sort of historicist philosophy which trades in privileged languages, peoples,
or epochs, such as we find in the writings of Hegel or Gentile or Heidegger. 
  					</font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">Of course not all analytic philosophers have adopted the Fregean idea. 
Thus there are the more or less pragmatically oriented views of language favoured
by Wittgenstein or by the speech act theorists. There is the view embraced
by Quine or Winch which sees sentences as acquiring meaning only within the
context of some `conceptual scheme'. None of these conceptions even comes
close, however, to a view which might sanction a rekindling of that orientation
around master texts treated as authoritative which was once characteristic
of all major philosophical cultures. <br>&nbsp; </font></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4">Epilogue: On the sources of philosophical knowledge</font></b><font size="4">
					<br>What are the sources of philosophical knowledge and what are the methods of
verification of philosophical statements? To affirm that such statements are
known <i>a priori</i> is to do little more than give a name to a problem, 
comparable to talk of the Muses breathing life into the poet. The very terminology
of `sources of knowledge' is indeed a figurative extension, almost certainly
first used by the Alexandrian court poet Callimachus, of a word having as
its literal meaning: fountain of a stream or a river. `And not of every water
do the Melissae carry to Deo, but of the trickling stream that springs from
a holy fountain, pure and undefiled, the very crown of waters.'</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_24_">
(24)</a> </font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">To drink from the source from which another poet has drunk already, this
means, as tradition has it, to imitate the poet in one's work.<sup><a href="#N_25_">
(25)</a> </sup>And in this matter it is vital that one should `draw from the original 
pure source, not from its polluted derivatives.' For `the Muses, who once 
taught Hesiod and now answer Callimachus' questions, always utter the truth.'</font><sup><font size="4"><a href="#N_26_">
(26)</a> </font></sup></p>
					<p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="4">It seems clear, now, that some individuals do indeed have a peculiar 
facility or talent in the practice of philosophy, and that it was this fact
which was albeit implicitly recognized in the division respected by earlier
philosophical cultures between `<i>auctores</i>' and mere `<i>actores</i>
'. Certain individuals have that sort of tacit knowledge which is conducive 
to what, for want of a more adequate expression, we might call philosophical 
vision (perhaps also to the expression of philosophical vision, or indeed 
to the gathering or filtering of such vision from prior sources). And as Oakeshott
points out, tacit or practical knowledge `can neither be taught nor learned,
but only imparted and acquired. It exists only in practice'.<sup><a href="#N_27_">
(27)</a> </sup>Hence also all earlier philosophical cultures recognized that, just
as apprentice-painters need to learn the tacit skills of their art by copying 
the paintings of the masters, so students of philosophy need to <i>imitate</i>
 the activity and style of thinking of the philosophical masters and this 
by commenting on their works. Not least for this reason, then, is it important 
to turn to the very words of an author, to the original text. For as William 
Whetely (<i>fl</i>. 1309-16) points out, commenting on the <i>De disciplina 
scolarium</i> of pseudo-Boethius, it is the `statements of "authentic" men
that are the more diligently and firmly inscribed in the mind of the hearer.'<sup><a href="#N_28_">

					<br><a name="N_1_"></a>1. While Leibniz' <i>Nouveaux Essais</i> is most properly to be classified
as a critical review, it must be admitted that Locke's writings have elicited
genuine commentaries in other circles, as e.g. in: Henry Lee, <i>Anti-Scepticism:
or Notes upon each Chapter of Mr Lock's Essay Concerning Humane Understanding.
With an Explication of all the Particulars of which he Treats, and in the
same order</i> (1702), or more recently in: John Yolton, <i>Locke and the
Compass of Human Understanding. A Selective Commentary on the `Essay'</i>
 (1970). After Locke, however, philosophers writing in English seem to have
generated almost no commentary at all. Mill's <i>Examination of Sir William
Hamilton's Philosophy</i> is not a counter-instance, since Mill sets out
in this work to deal with Hamilton's <i>philosophy</i> and not with some
one single writing. Broad's <i>Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy</i>
(1933/38), on the other hand, is a genuine commentary, and the same can be
said also of <i>The Student's Handbook, Synoptical and Explanatory, of Mr
J. S. Mill's System of Logic</i> by the Rev. A. H. Killick (London, 1870).
Leaving aside these examples, however, and leaving aside also the rather
special case of commentaries prepared as parts of critical editions, the
reader will find it difficult to come up with further examples to add to
this list. </font></p>

to a universality of this sort; thus Whitehead, in our own century, and also
Jonathan Edwards and then it is significant that isolated commentaries have
indeed been prepared on their works. On Whitehead see Donald W. Sherburne, <i>A Key to Whitehead's Process and Reality</i> (1971); and on Edwards

to constitute an exception in relation to condition ii. Certainly these writings
display none of that sort of etymological wordplay that is characteristic
