      <blockquote>The paper draws on the distinction, first expounded by
Husserl, between <i>formal logic </i>and <i>formal ontology</i>. Formal logic
concerns itself with meaning-structures; formal ontology with structures
amongst objects and their parts. We show how, when formal-ontological considerations 
are brought into play, contemporary extensionalist theories of part and whole,
and above all the mereology of Lesniewski, can be generalised to embrace
not only relations between concrete objects and object-pieces, but also relations
between what we shall call dependent parts or moments. A two-dimensional
formal language is canvassed for the resultant ontological theory, a language
which owes more to the tradition of Euler, Boole and Venn than to the quantifier-centred
languages which have predominated amongst analytic philosophers since the
time of Frege and Russell. Analytic philosophical arguments against moments
(accidents, tropes, individual qualities), and against the entire project
of a formal ontology, are considered and rejected. The paper concludes with
a brief account of some applications of the theory presented.</blockquote>
