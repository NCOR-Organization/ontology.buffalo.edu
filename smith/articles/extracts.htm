<p>We believe that, with a combination of detailed biology and rigorous
ontological analysis, it is possible to resolve the issue of when the human
individual begins to exist. We lay down a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions for being a human individual and we determine when these conditions
are first satisfied. We conclude that the pertinent categorial change takes
place around sixteen days after fertilization, and we consider a range
of arguments for and against this conclusion.

<p><b>0. Introduction</b>
<p>We shall help ourselves in what follows to the Danish term 'foster',
which refers in neutral fashion to the human zygote, embryo, or fetus at
the different stages of its development, and we shall focus on the question
of the transtemporal identity or non-identity of the foster with the human
individual as it exists after birth.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>6. The Development of the Foster</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Our aim is to establish the ontology
of the process by which human beings are formed. To this end we will need
to consider briefly the biological details of the development of the foster.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The story begins when an egg-cell,
developed in the ovaries, is released into the fimbrated end of the fallopian
tube (ovulation). The egg-cell, swimming free in the fluid-filled tube,
is encountered by a sperm, and the latter initiates a process of penetration.
(This is what happens in the normal case. In very rare circumstances a
sperm cell might attach itself to one of the additional, much tinier cells
which are also floating in the fallopian tube. These are the so-called
'polar bodies', deriving from eggs released at earlier stages in their
development.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Fertilization. </i>The first stage
in the process of penetration is the fusion of the membrane of the sperm
cell with that of the egg. This results in the formation of a channel that
allows the passage of the nucleus of the sperm cell into the egg. The male
genetic material that is carried by this nucleus then fuses with genetic
material from the nucleus of the egg-cell. The two nuclei come into contact
in the egg cytoplasm, and shed their nuclear membranes. Each offers up
one complete set of 23 chromosomes, and these two sets of chromosomes become
entwined around each other as part of a process which transforms the egg-cell
into a new joint product, called the zygote, an unusually large cell which
has the same membrane as the egg-cell before fertilization.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Cell Division. </i>Immediately upon
formation the zygote begins to undergo a process of cell division. During
the very first cell divisions (up to the eight-cell stage), there is no
qualitative distinction between the cell that is dividing and the cells
resulting from the division. The cells are functionally and qualitatively
undifferentiated. Thus, each has the potential to produce a complete human
being (each is, as the jargon has it, 'totipotential'). The cells are kept
together spatially by a surrounding thin membrane (the <i>zona pellucida</i>),
which was also the membrane of the egg-cell before fertilization, but there
is no causal interaction between them. They are separate bodies which adhere
to each other through their sticky surfaces. The cells are at this stage
still floating free, inside their common membrane, in the fluid-filled
fallopian tube, but they have begun to move towards the womb (uterus).</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Formation of the Morula. </i>Because
of the limited space within the <i>zona pellucida</i>, a compaction takes
place between the 8- and 16-cell stage (day 3).<sup><a href="#N_10_"> (10)</a></sup>
As a result of this compaction, the inner cells divide faster than the
outer cells which surround them. At this time tight junctions between the
cells are formed; neighboring cells are connected by highly selective permeable
membranes which are marked by channels through which signal molecules can
be transported from one side to the other. The resulting bundle of cells
is now called a <i>morula</i> (Latin for 'mulberry'). The morula is formed
as the cells move from the fallopian tube and into the womb.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">When there are about 60 cells present
(day 4), there occurs a clear differentiation between the so-called 'inner
cell mass' and 'the trophectoderm' (an outer ring of cells). The latter
functions henceforth as the surrounding membrane in place of the
<i>zona
pellucida</i> which disintegrates. In addition, pools of clear fluid which
had accumulated between some of the internal cells coalesce to form a common
cavity called the <i>blastocoel</i>, a body of extracellular fluid in which
the inner cell mass thereafter floats. The two groups of cells, taken together
with this fluid, are now called the 'blastocyst'. The entire blastocyst
itself floats freely in the uterine fluid for about a day and continues
to exist disconnected from the mother.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Implantation. </i>Over the next
week (days 6-13) there occurs a process called implantation (also 'nidation',
from the Latin <i>nidus</i>: a nest, or niche). The blastocyst, on completing
its journey along the fallopian tube into the uterine cavity, moves into
a position where it is in contact with the uterine wall, to which it adheres
via its sticky exterior. Cells on its outer surface then begin to grow
rapidly in such a way as to disrupt the surface of the wall. These cells
actively burrow into the deeper tissue until they have become completely
embedded. The inner cells of the blastocyst are however still not connected
to the mother, since they float in the liquid contained within the trophoblastic
membrane. With the implantation of the blastocyst in the wall of the womb
comes the formation from its inner cell mass of what is called the 'embryonic
disc'. This consists of two kinds of cell mass: the epiblast, which will
eventually give rise to the embryo proper and to parts of the umbilical
cord; and the hypoblast which will give rise to extra-embryonic membranes
and tissues.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Gastrulation. </i>When the embryonic
disc is fully implanted in the wall of the womb (day 13), it is able to
grow and can begin to differentiate into the various tissues that will
characterize the human being into which it develops. Only at this point
does the disc begin to receive nutrients from the mother. Until now, only
cell division has taken place. The morula has not grown in size compared
to the egg-cell; rather, its constituent cells have become smaller. Now
however the embryonic disc begins to grow, as the neural folds are formed
and the primitive cardiovascular system begins to function. This stage,
which begins around day 14-15, is called 'gastrulation'. It consists in
a convergence of the epiblastic cells into what is called 'the primitive
streak', a stacking of cells on the end of the embryonic disc which will
develop into the spine. During the process of gastrulation (days 14-19),
the epiblast differentiates into three cell types: the mesoderm (which
will become the smooth muscle coats, connective tissues, blood cells, bone
marrow, the skeleton and the reproductive and excretory organs of the fetus),
the ectoderm (which will become the epithelia and the nervous system),
and the endoderm (which will become the linings of the respiratory passages
and of the digestive tract). In addition, some cells of the epiblast form
the umbilical cord. Not all of the cells of the embryonic disc are going
to develop into the fetus. Some of its cells (the non-epiblastic cells)
will form the extraembryonic membranes (the amnion, the chorion and part
of the placenta) and other extra embryonic tissues.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The embryonic disc is now commonly
referred to as the embryo proper, a term which is used to describe the
developing foster until the ninth week after fertilization, from when it
is called the 'fetus'.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">A few days after gastrulation there
begins to form the fluid-filled amniotic cavity in which the foster will
float until the end of its term. This amniotic cavity is within the wall
of the uterus, and as it expands it brings about a consequent contraction
of the uterine cavity proper. Surprisingly, therefore, the embryo/fetus
is for almost the whole of its development not, strictly speaking, inside
the uterus (or womb, or uterine cavity); rather it is lodged within a specially
created cavity inside the uterine lining. This multiple-cavity structure
enclosing the foster provides a cushion against mechanical injury.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The placenta is a flat organ which
supplies nutrients for the fetus during its development. It develops from
the outer cell layer (from the trophoblastic cells) in the early embryo
which fastens itself to the wall of the uterus from around day 21 and becomes
anchored to the mother via a maternal portion formed by part of the functional
layer of the uterine membrane. Together with the other fetal membranes
(the amnion and the chorion), it disintegrates some moments after birth,
when it is delivered through the birth canal.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The umbilical cord is an organ of the
fetus that penetrates the placenta via two large arteries which radiate
outwards from the point where breaks through into the inner surface of
the placenta and divide into small arteries that penetrate ever further
into the depths of the placenta through hundreds of branching strands of
tissue known as 'villi'. These villi cause a rupturing of the mother's
blood vessels in their vicinity and are thereby bathed in maternal blood.
The constant circulation of fetal and maternal blood and the very thin
tissue separating fetal blood from maternal blood bathing the villi provide
a mechanism for interchange of blood constituents between the maternal
and fetal bloodstreams. However, it is normally not the case that there
is opportunity for the blood of one to gain access to the blood vessels
of the other. Rather, nutrients, oxygen, and antibodies diffuse into the
fetal blood in the capillaries of the villi, and wastes and carbon dioxide
diffuse out of these capillaries into the maternal blood circulation. (Compare
the way in which oxygen is transmitted to fish via pipes which feed air
into the water of an aquarium.)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><i>Development of the Fetus. </i>At
about 40 to 43 days after conception the rudimentary brain at the top of
the primitive streak begins to function. At the ninth week, the fetus has
almost all human characteristics (except for the face and genitals) and
it begins to show signs of specific male or female development. During
the tenth week, the face and the genitals begin to develop. In the twelfth
week, when the foster is nine centimeters long, it begins to move its hands
and feet. Its movements increase around the sixteenth week, when hair also
begins to grow and teeth are developed. At the twentieth week, the foster
can suck and swallow and its body bends and stretches. From then on the
foster continues to grow in size until, at the end of the fortieth week,
it is born.</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times"><b>7. Alternative Thresholds</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Given this simplified account of fetal
development, let us return to the question of transtemporal identity. When
does the foster first satisfy the ten conditions set out above for being
a substance which is also a relatively isolated causal system? At what
stage is the foster transtemporally identical to the human being it becomes
after birth? We distinguish the following nine possibilities:</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">a. The stage of the single-cell zygote
(day 0)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">b: The stage of the multi-cell zygote
(days 0-3)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">c. The stage of the morula (day 3)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">d. The stage of the early blastocyst
(day 4)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">e. Implantation (days 6-13)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">f. The formation of the primitive streak
(days 14-16)</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">g. Viability (e.g. day 140)</span>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">a. The zygote is a substance: it is
a bearer of change; it persists through a time-interval; it is extended
in space and it has spatial parts such as the nucleus, the cell-membrane
and the filaments inside it; it has its own connected exterior boundary
which divides its interior from its exterior and which connects the parts
within its interior and thus distinguishes it from a mere heap or collection.
Moreover the zygote is an independent entity in the sense that it does
not require the existence of any specific second entity in order to exist.
(Thus it can survive transplantation.) The zygote is moreover, like every
other cell, a relatively isolated causal system. It is shielded by its
outer membrane from causal influences deriving from its exterior; the events
transpiring within its interior are subject to a division between stable
and critical events; and it contains its own rudimentary mechanisms for
reestablishing stability in cases of disturbance. But there is an obvious
reason why this zygote substance cannot be identical to the human being
which will exist after birth, namely that it is predestined to undergo
fission, and this means that it will cease to exist almost immediately
after it has been formed.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">b. The second possibility is that it
is at the stage of the multi-cellular zygote-bundle that the human being
comes into existence. But the zygote is at this stage most properly conceived
as a sticky assemblage of 8 or 16 entities rather than as a single entity.
They are not one but many. Although they are surrounded by a thin permeable
membrane, this membrane merely helps to keep the cells together in the
spatial sense; there is no flow of nutrients or signal molecules from the
outside to the inside of the membrane or from one cell to another, and
the cell bundle has no stability-restoring mechanism of its own of the
sort which is required in order for the whole entity to be a single causal
system.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">Perhaps, though, we can hold on to
the view that the multi-cell zygote is already a human individual by arguing
that some one cell within the bundle is privileged by the fact that it
inherits from the original single cell the property of serving as the bearer
of identity for the human being that is in process of development. The
problem with this view is that it contradicts totipotentiality -- the feature
in virtue of which each of the cells within the multi-cell zygote has the
full potential to develop into a human being.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">To see the problem here, we must understand
how differentiation works. Differentiation is the creation, from a mere
aggregate of homogeneous cells, of clusters of functionally and structurally
different types of connected tissue at different sites. In the case before
us, all the cells maintain forever the same genetic composition (that of
the original fertilized egg-cell). However, the very genes involved contain
the programming for differentiation. This programming goes into effect
in different cells in different ways, not because of any intrinsic features
of the cells themselves, but rather as a result of the specific environments
surrounding them and thus of the macroscopic structures which they together
go to form. This surrounding context determines that some of the genes
within each given cell become repressed, so that only some types of protein
are made. That it is the environment surrounding a given cell which determines
what kind of proteins will be formed (or 'expressed') by the cell can be
seen from the fact that, if cells of a given type are moved artificially
to a different environment where they are surrounded by cells of a different
type, then they will begin to express the same proteins as the cells which
surround them. Since, at the stage of the multi-celled zygote, no differentiation
has taken place, it follows that there can be no cell or bundle of cells
within the cluster which is privileged in virtue of some intrinsic feature
which it might possess.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">c. At the formation of the morula,
too, differentiation has not yet taken place, and so the just-mentioned
argument can be applied in this case also (as also in cases d. and e.,
below). Each of the cells of the morula still has the potential to become
a human being. At this stage, junctions between the cells of the zygote
are formed which allow intercellular communication by means of small signal-molecules.
But the morula still fails to meet condition <i>10. </i>for being a causally
isolated system. That is, it does not possess mechanisms of its own to
restore stability in cases of external disturbance. At best it must rely
on the separate rudimentary stability-restoring mechanisms of its constituent
cells. The morula is still, in our terms, a loosely connected cluster of
cells.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">d. At the stage of the early blastocyst,
the cells have differentiated into the inner cell mass and the surrounding
trophoblast. The inner cell mass constitutes a single substance, rather
than many substances, insofar as its cells together form a single connected
whole with a common physical boundary. The inner cell mass also begins
to constitute a relatively isolated causal system, but it still lacks its
own internal mechanisms in virtue of which its several parts would in cases
of disturbance work together as a whole to restore stability. The inner
cell mass will differentiate into two further tissues and only one of them
will eventually become the embryo. The other will turn into membranes and
extraembryonic tissue. This is not in and of itself important for determining
whether or not it is transtemporally identical to the later human being,
for one may argue that the membranes and extraembryonic tissues are merely
temporary parts of the embryo in much the same sense as baby teeth are
temporary parts of the child. What is important, however, is that, following
our account of differentiation above, it is not yet determined which parts
of the inner cell mass are predestined to become embryonic cells. Thus
the stage of formation of the inner cell mass at day 4 still does not seem
to be a good candidate stage for the formation of the human being.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">e. When the process of implantation
comes to an end, the embryo can begin to receive nutrients from the mother
and can begin to grow as an individual and to differentiate into tissues
of different sorts which are recognizable precursors of neonatal tissues.
However, as for the early blastocyst, so also here, it seems that the foster
still lacks its own integrated mechanism for restoring stability, and so
it fails to be a relatively isolated causal system in the sense at issue.
An identification of the foster as it now exists with the later human being,
however, faces the problem that the foster has entered into a condition
of being dependent on the mother the mother for nutrients and oxygen as
well as for temperature control and other forms of protection. Does this
imply that the foster is henceforth such as to fall short of being a substance
because it does not satisfy condition <i>6.</i>?<i> </i>Certainly, if it
is extracted from the mother it will almost certainly die through lack
of nutrients and through lack of an appropriate protective environment
into which it can fit. But this applies also, for example, to an Arctic
explorer in relation to her winter ice station.<i> </i>It is known from
the animal kingdom that premature offspring can often survive in external
environments. A kangaroo foster, for example, is born alive at a very immature
stage when it is only about one inch long and weighs less than one gram.
After birth it uses its forelimbs to crawl up the mother's body and enter
the pouch which is a pocket on the mother which opens forward and contains
teats. The baby kangaroo grows in the pocket and gradually spends more
and more time outside the pouch, which it leaves for good at the age of
seven to ten months. The amniotic cavity, in which the foster develops
upon implantation, is in some sense like a kangaroo pouch, though instead
of being open (in the sense of having an aperture) it is a closed cavity.
As the kangaroo foster is not rigidly dependent on one specific mother,
but only on an appropriate environment with teats and so forth, so the
foster is not rigidly dependent on the mother, but only on some appropriate
environment, which might from a certain point be supplied by means of an
incubator. This means that the foster is not dependent on the mother in
the ontological sense of dependence that is involved, for example, in the
relation between a smile and a face, or between an individual instance
of color and some extended surface.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">f. According to Ford (1988), the point
where a human individual comes into existence is the time when the epiblast
ceases to be a cluster of homogenous cells and begins to transform itself
into a heterogeneous entity. He suggests that this happens with the formation
of the primitive streak (around day 16). At this point, he argues, the
cells of the epiblast have formed a whole multicellular individual living
being which has a body axis and bilateral symmetry; that is, it is spatially
oriented. The embryo's cranial axis and its dorsal and ventral surfaces
come into existence, and the whole has acquired effective mechanisms to
protect itself and to restore stability in face of disturbance.&nbsp;</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">McLaren (1984), too, offers a defense
of the thesis that it is the formation of the primitive streak which marks
the beginning of the human being. This, he argues, marks the beginning
of a human individual insofar as the boundaries of a discrete, coherent
entity have now been formed. At this point the foster also meets the other
part of criterion <i>8. </i>to the effect that it is protected against
outside disturbance by the jacket of cells surrounding it. That is to say,
at the formation of the primitive streak, there is formed for the first
time a bona fide spatial boundary which delineates the embryo spatially
from the extraembryonic tissue. Before this point it is not determined
which cells will become the embryo and which the surrounding membranes.
In the case of adult human beings, in contrast, it is determined which
parts (for example: nails, hair) can be removed without the human being
ceasing to exist. In this respect too, therefore, the foster is from the
stage of the formation of the primitive streak more like the adult human
being than it is like the foster at earlier stages.</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">The tighter integration of the foster
that arises with the formation of the primitive streak is manifested most
importantly in the fact that twinning is from this point on no longer possible.
If fission occurs just before the formation of the primitive streak, this
will in almost all cases give rise to malformations (Siamese twins).</span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Times">g. It has often been suggested that
the human individual begins to exist at the point when the foster becomes
viable; that is, when it can live outside its mother's womb. The argument
is that because, prior to this time, the foster cannot survive independently
of its mother, it is analogous to an organ of the mother, which can only
exist and exercise its proper function within the locus of its proper encompassing
environment. The problem with this view, however, is that the transition
to viability does not in itself connote a transformation of one entity
into another. The passage into viability of the foster may coincide with
such a transformation process, but it does not necessarily do so. Rather,
this passage may involve no genuine change in the foster, but may represent
a mere Cambridge change of the sort which is expressed by propositions
such as 'John is no longer beloved in South Africa', or 'Mary just ceased
to be the tallest player in the team.' Acquiring stronger muscles is a
real (though not a categorial) change, but the satisfaction of the viability
criterion is not dependent on such physical changes in the foster; it may
be satisfied, for example, through advances in technology.</span>
