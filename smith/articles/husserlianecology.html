<b><font face="Times New Roman">The Ride on Lake Constance</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">If mind is a creature of adaptation, then
our standard theories of intentionality and of mental representation are
in need of considerable revision. For such theories, deriving under Cartesian
inspiration from the work of Brentano, Husserl and their followers, are
context free. They conceive the subject of mental experience in isolation
from any surrounding physico-biological environment.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Husserl sought in his later writings to
find room for the surrounding world of human practical experience, and
a similar expansion of concerns can be detected also in the writings of
other later phenomenologists such as Heidegger, and Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty.
But in none of these authors do we find sustained attempts to grapple with
the intervolvements of the world of human thought, feeling and action with
the environment of human behavior as this is described by physics and biology.</font>
<p>The tradition of philosophizing initiated by Brentano included also
however a group of holistically inclined thinkers forming what is commonly
referred to as the 'Berlin School' of Gestalt psychology. The members of
this school, and most especially Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K&ouml;hler,
Kurt Koffka, and Kurt Lewin, sought to understand the relations between
acts and objects as parts or moments of a larger relation of engagement
between subjects and objects in a common physical and biological environment.
They embraced, in other words, what one might call an ecological approach
to psychological phenomena. Koffka and Lewin&nbsp; in their turn influenced
two American psychologists J. J. Gibson and Roger Barker, both of whom
(independently) conceived their work under the banner of 'ecological psychology.'
It is against this background that the term 'Husserlian ecology' is to
be understood in what follows.
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Brentano and his early disciples were still
working under the influence of immanentistic or representationalist philosophies.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
External objects and external environments they conceived as a matter of
appearance (sometimes of 'projection' or 'construction' or 'constitution')
and they saw themselves as facing the task of deriving proofs, Cartesian
style, for the existence of an external reality from the data of immanent
experience. The Gestalt psychologists, in contrast, had no qualms in accepting
the reality of the world described in physical theories and they were indeed
among the first to investigate the relations between mental experiences
and associated processes in the brain. They still, however, when turning
to the external environment of human behavior and perception saw the latter
as something like a manifest image constructed by the human subject. Hence
they were left with the task - which we might think of as an externalized
counterpart of the mind-body problem - of explaining the relation between
this constructed environment and the world of physics.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To see the nature of this problem, it will
be useful to quote the passage from Koffka's <i>Principles of Gestalt Psychology</i>
in which a fateful distinction between the psychological (or 'behavioral')
and physical (or 'geographic') environments is introduced:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">On a winter evening amidst a driving
snowstorm a man on horseback arrived at an inn, happy to have reached shelter
after hours of riding over the wind-swept plain on which the blanket of
snow had covered all paths and landmarks. The landlord who came to the
door viewed the stranger with surprise and asked him whence he came. The
man pointed in the direction straight away from the inn, whereupon the
landlord, in a tone of awe and wonder, said: 'Do you know that you have
ridden across the Lake of Constance?' At which the rider dropped stone
dead at his feet.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">The Problem of the 'Two Worlds'</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">In what environment, Koffka asks, did
the behavior of the stranger take place? 'The Lake of Constance. Certainly
[... and it is] interesting for the geographer that this behaviour took
place in this particular locality. But not for the psychologist as the
student of behaviour.' The latter, Koffka insists, will have to say that
there is a second sense to the word 'environment,' according to which 'our
horseman did not ride across the lake at all, but across an ordinary snow-swept
plain. His behaviour was a riding-over-a-plain, but not a riding-over-a-lake.'
(Koffka 1935, pp. 27f.)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">How, then, are we to understand the relationship
between the physical and the psychological environment? The tale of the
ride across Lake Constance tells us that we cannot conceive these two environments
as identical in every case. If we say that they are always distinct (and
thus embrace a 'two-world' hypothesis), then we gain the advantage of a
uniform domain for psychological science, but we face the problem of explaining
how this psychological domain (and our psychological life) might ever come
into contact with the domain of physics. Perhaps we can solve this latter
problem by asserting an identity of psychological and geographic environment
in those standard or default cases where there is a match between experience
and objects, and affirm the existence of a special psychological environment
only in cases of mismatch of the sort described by Koffka. This, however,
would imply a peculiar ontological heterogeneity of psychological experience
(which from the perspective of the experiencing subject would yet <i>appear</i>
homogeneous). For it would imply that we would bounce back and forth between
genuine interaction with physical reality and quasi-solipsistic concern
with our own psychological creations, in a way which would imply also a
corresponding disunity of the domain of psychological science.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Like their Brentanist predecessors, the
Berlin Gestaltists embraced the first of these two alternatives. They were
consequently not able to come to a coherent account of the relationship
between the psychological environment (and psychologically experienced
objects) and the transcendent world of physical things. This is true even
of the most sophisticated theories of the psychological environment such
as those advanced by Kurt Lewin and by Meinong's student Fritz Heider:
the psychological environment is for them, too, something that is dependent
upon the ego (something that is present even in dreams: Heider 1959a).
And it is true, also, of mainstream psychology today, which characteristically
adopts the standpoint of 'methodological solipsism' (Fodor 1980). The issue
of the relationship between psychological and physical phenomena is hereby
bracketed forever in order to ensure an ontologically uniform domain for
psychological science within which both true and false beliefs and both
veridical and non-veridical perceptual phenomena can enjoy equal civil
rights.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Husserl's Phenomenology and Its Biological
Problems</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Fodor argues that if a genuine ('nomological')
science of psychology is to be possible at all, then a hypothesis of representationalism
must be adopted according to which mental processes are to be understood
n terms of relations that organisms bear to immanent mental representations.
The science of phenomenology, as Husserl tells us in similar vein, has
as its subject-matter:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">all the species of acts which
the researcher of any kind of science accomplishes, all the species of
meanings which in such acts mediate the relation to objectivities, all
the modes of appearances in which these objectivities enter into the researcher's
consciousness, all the modes of thoughtful grasping and noetical qualification
which emerge therewith - all these become in phenomenology theoretical
objects. Phenomenology does not investigate the objects investigated by
the researcher in other sciences; on the contrary, it investigates the
total system of possible acts of consciousness, of possible appearances
and meanings related to precisely those objects. (Hua IV, p. 312)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Phenomenology is, then, the methodologically
solipsistic investigation of acts in general, and of their meanings and
directedness towards objects; and it ought, so conceived, to remain neutral
in relation to metaphysical questions pertaining to the status of the external
objects of different types towards which our acts are putatively directed.
But Husserl does not remain neutral in this respect. If we examine the
structure of consciousness, he tells us, 'then we see that all of nature,
with space, time, causality, etc., is completely dissolved into a web of
immanent motivations.' (Hua IV, p. 226) The stream of consciousness is
a procession of positings. These positings are regulated by strict rules.
But there is, as Husserl sees things, <i>nothingelse</i>, nothing beyond
a certain harmonious play of immanent motivations among such acts.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One notorious problem with all such representationalist
views is the difficulty they face in accounting for the existence of harmony
among the different worlds which arise when 'world' is relativized to your
or my subjective appearances. Even if, with Husserl, we see 'world' as
relativized to all human beings,<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> there
still remains the problem of accounting for the interaction between this
human world and the worlds of other biological species as also between
all of these and the world of physical science.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
Husserl's attempts to resolve these problems, above all in the
<i>Cartesian
Meditations</i>, are brilliant indeed. Unfortunately, they remain rooted
in considerations of the world as this is given in human experience and
fall far short of what would be needed if the ontology of this intersubjective
human world is to leave room for the possibility of interaction on the
physical and biological plane.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Scheler's Doctrine of the Milieu</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">A similar quandary is faced also by Scheler,
whose theory of the 'milieu' of practical life is of incidental interest
in virtue of its influence on Heidegger's philosophizing. The things (<i>Sachen</i>)
which are relevant to our acting, Scheler tells us, those things belonging
to the <i>milieu</i> of our everyday practical life,</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">have of course not the slightest
to do either with Kant's 'thing in itself' or with the objects conceived
by science (through the supposition of which science 'explains' natural
facts). The sun of the milieu of human beings is not the sun of astronomy.
The meat that is stolen, bought, or what have you, is not a sum of cells
and tissues with the chemicophysical processes which take place within
them. The sun of the milieu is different at the North Pole, in moderate
zones, and at the equator, and its beams are felt as different beams. (Scheler
1954, p. 158f., Eng. trans., p. 139)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The problem with this passage is clear. As
schoolboys with microscopes know, meat that is stolen and bought does most
certainly possess cells and tissues which undergo chemicophysical properties.
It simply cannot be the case that the things in our practical, commonsensical
environment have 'not the slightest' to do with the objects conceived by
science.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Electrical and magnetic currents, Scheler
wants to hold, may affect me 'objectively,' but they do not belong to my
milieu, which comprehends 'only that which I effectively experience.' But
is it really possible to mark out a 'world' of what is effectively experienced
without at the same time letting in all manner of cells, tissues, fields,
currents, and the chemicophysical properties relating thereto?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">One option pursued by Scheler is to see
milieu-things as being in some sense intermediate between persons and the
'objective' reality that is studied by physics, as belonging to an <i>intermediate
realm </i>'lying between our perceptual content and its objects on the
one hand and those objectively thought objects on the other.'<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup>
In the absence, however, of a satisfactory account of the relationship
between such milieu-things and their physical counterparts, Scheler comes
teeteringly close to the sort of idealist position which in other contexts
he strenuously abjured.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">An alternative view would conceive the
milieu as in some sense a product of
<i>selection</i>. As Scheler himself
writes at one point, milieu-objects are 'cut out of the totality of world-facts'
on the basis of the value-directions immanent to our acting as embodied
beings. My milieu-world is rich or poor, on this account, in proportion
to the fullness of the value repertoire which drives my actions.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>
If what is selected is a
<i>part</i> of the whole with which we begin,
however, then all of its parts must be included in the selection also (this
follows from the transitivity of the relation of part to whole). On a selectionist
view, therefore, we are forced to embrace the conclusion that milieu-things
do after all include all those cells and molecules and all of those chemico-physical
processes which Scheler had sought to exclude from the environment of human
action.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The milieu, for Scheler, is something holistic:
it is not the <i>sum</i> of things I perceive or take an interest in or
pay attention to; rather I can be intentionally related only to what already
belongs to my milieu. The milieu is a fund of objects, a fund of all of
that of which we have the ability to take account in our practical day-to-day
dealings with the world. The milieu can include not only food, utensils,
people, buildings, but also the laws which I obey or disobey, the value-qualities
which make things attractive or repulsive, and other features outside the
realm of material things. Thus a given territory presents different milieux
to one who recognizes the authorities which prevail within it, to a criminal,
and to one who is an enemy in time of war. The same forest is likewise
a different milieu to a forester, a hunter, a hiker, as also to a deer
or a lizard.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Uexk&uuml;ll's Constructivist Biology</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Scheler's ontology of milieux recalls
the constructivist biology of his contemporary Jakob von Uexk&uuml;ll.
Every animal, Uexk&uuml;ll held, is the <i>creator</i> of its own 'external
reality', of an environment that is constructed by the organism to meet
its own needs. The 'first principle' of Uexk&uuml;ll's theory of environments
of <i>Umweltlehre</i> reads as follows:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">all animals, from the simplest
to the most complex, are fitted into their unique worlds with equal completeness.
A simple world corresponds to a simple animal, a well-articulated world
to a complex one. (Uexk&uuml;ll 1957, p. 10)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">On the one hand, these created realities are
seen as separated off from each other in the manner of Leibnizian monads
(Uexk&uuml;ll himself refers to them as 'soap bubbles'<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup>).
On the other hand, the separate monads are held to be capable of interacting
- though the explanations we are offered of this interaction by Uexk&uuml;ll
and his followers are, to say the least, difficult to understand. The eye,
we are told in one such explanation, 'throws' the picture that is produced
on its retina out of itself into the visual space surrounding the animal.
'If the eye did not have this capacity, the dragonfly would not be able
to catch a midge in flight. … Sounds, smells, tastes, and touch are all
transposed out of the body and into the subjective space of the animal.'
(Jennings 1909, p. 333)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Uexk&uuml;ll is reported to have arrived
at this projectivist doctrine when, on looking up at a beech tree in the
Heidelberg woods, he came to the realization that:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">This is not <i>a</i> beech tree,
but rather
<i>my
</i>beech tree, something that I, with my sensations,
have constructed in all its details. Everything that I see, hear, smell
or feel are not qualities that exclusively belong to the beech, but rather
are characteristics of my sense organs that I project outside of myself.
(Schmidt 1980, p. 10, cited in Harrington 1996, p. 41)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">As Uexk&uuml;ll formulated the matter in his
<i>Theoretical Biology </i>(1928, p. 2): 'All reality is subjective appearance
- this must serve as the fundamental insight of biology, too.'</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Kantian flavor of Uexk&uuml;ll's thinking
becomes especially clear in a letter to Houston Stewart Chamberlain of
1923, on the opposition between what Uexk&uuml;ll calls the 'intuitive
space' or <i>Anschauungsraum</i> of the animal environment and the 'space
of representations' (the <i>Vorstellungsraum</i>) of science. The latter,
Uexk&uuml;ll holds, forfeits any claim to reality. 'Intuitive space alone
is real.'<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We are indeed capable of building a space
of representations, in which the suns and stars move at incredible distances
and in inconceivable time. But this space of representations is just a
watering-down of our intuitive space, that we gain by allowing several
important elements of this intuitive space to fall away.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Uexk&uuml;ll felt some hesitation in proclaiming
this position, fearing (rightly) that he would either be misunderstood
or considered mad. But nonetheless, he insisted, 'it remains a fact: "<i>Epur
non si move.</i>"<i> </i>I do not move around the sun, but rather the sun
rises and sets in my arch of the sky. It is always another sun, always
a new space in which it moves.'<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> And
in further Kantian vein: 'Space owes its existence to the inner organization
of the human subject, who clothes the sense qualities in spatial form.'
(Uexk&uuml;ll 1928, p. 4) Or again:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">In the eye of the naive person
only the one world of appearances is visible, which, surrounded by space
and time, is full of sounding, smelling, coloured things. Scientific research
seeks to influence this naive world view from two opposing sides. Physical
theory seeks to convince the naive person that the world he sees is full
of subjective illusions, and that the one real world is much poorer, since
it consists merely in an immense and eternal swirling dance of atoms unfurling
itself in purely causal fashion. Biological theory, in contrast, seeks
to draw to the attention of the naive person the fact that he sees much
too little, and that the real world is much richer than he suspects because
there is spread out around every living thing its own world of appearance,
which is like his world in its basic traits but which nonetheless manifests
so many variations that he could devote his whole life to the study of
these worlds without there ever being an end in sight …. And when once
we have made a beginning in showing in regard to a few animals what environments
surround them like solid but invisible glass houses, then we will soon
be able to people the world around us with numberless other shimmering
worlds, which will intensify the riches of our world a further thousandfold.
In this way biology offers to the naive man an unlimited enrichment of
his world, while the physicist makes of him a beggar. (Uexk&uuml;ll 1928,
p. 62)</font></blockquote>

<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Ecological Realism</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Uexk&uuml;ll's expostulations are colorful
indeed. But they do not even begin to answer the obvious objections to
his monadological project when it comes to giving an account of the interaction
between organisms of different species (a problem which for Uexk&uuml;ll
himself, who rejected the theory of evolution, was not of pressing importance).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">With the work of Gibson and Barker in the
1960s, however, we meet a new and more consequential phase in the treatment
of this problem, a phase in which the external environment is at last given
its due. To a much greater degree than is manifest in even the most radical
Gestaltist writings, Gibson and Barker emphasize the fact that normal psychological
experience is to be understood not in terms of a succession of relations
between acts on the one hand and objects in some special 'realm,' but rather
in terms of a <i>topological nesting,</i> whereby the sentient organism
is housed or situated within a surrounding environment of which it serves
as interior boundary.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup> Its perceptions
and actions are then mere partial moments, dependent features of the total
subject-environment relation, and are capable of being properly understood
only as occurring within this wider surrounding framework. At the same
time the environment is itself to be conceived as something that falls
within the realm of physics.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In perception, as in action, from the Gibson-Barker
point of view, we are embrangled with the very things themselves in the
surrounding world, and not, for example, with 'sense data' or 'representations'
(or 'noemata' in Husserlian terminology). Perception is not a matter of
the processing of sensations. Rather, it is part of that direct linkage
between the perceiving organism and its environment which grows out of
the fact that, in its active looking, touching, tasting, feeling, the organism
as purposeful creature is bound up with those very objects - the ripened
fruit, the crumpled shirt, the empty glass, the broken spear - which are
relevant to its life and to its tasks of the moment.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Gibson and Barker thus embrace a radically
externalistic view of mind and action. We have not a Cartesian mind or
soul, with its interior theater of 'contents' or 'representations' or 'beliefs
and desires' and the consequent problem of explaining how this mind or
soul and its psychological environment can succeed, via intentionality,
in grasping objects external to itself. Rather, we have a perceiving, acting
organism, whose perceptions and actions are always already inextricably
intertwingled with the parts and moments, the things and surfaces, of its
external environment.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Roger Barker and the Theory of Physical-Behavioral
Units</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Now much of this is of course in keeping
with what we read in phenomenological descriptions of the life world, the
world of human projects, of the ready-to-hand, in Husserl, Scheler, or
Heidegger, as also in Sartre or Merleau-Ponty (both of whom were influenced
by Lewin and the other Gestaltists). Thus as Husserl tells us in <i>Ideas
</i>II,
the common-sense world is a world in which people work, converse, judge,
evaluate; a world of animals, tables, clothes, food; of sweet and bitter,
red and green, hot and cold. It is above all a world of <i>things </i>which
we put to use for various practical purposes, things which exist always
<i>in
situ</i>, which is to say: in an environment of other real things.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to things, this common-sense
world comprehends also the media (for example air, smoke) in which we move
(see Heider 1959b). Barker now goes on to point out that there are, within
this extended array of things and media, certain discriminable areas of
organization which cross-cut each other on a number of distinct dimensions.
The world is organized not only into separate things or bodies, but also
into overlapping personal, social and institutional zones or contexts -
Barkerian counterparts of Scheler's <i>milieux - </i>within which human
beings figure as participants. It is then not as if we have persons on
one side and thingly contexts on the other, with a gulf between them that
is bridged via intentionality. Rather, Barker insists, persons themselves,
and things in the spatial environment, are both equally caught up within
entities of a new, over-arching type, which he calls <i>behavior settings</i>
or <i>physical-behavioral units</i>,<i> </i>entities which serve as the
successive environments of persons and groups of persons as they go about
their business from day to day.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The examples of physical-behavioral units
favored by Barker - who was one of Lewin's first assistants at the Iowa
Child Welfare Station - are: Wendy's Friday afternoon class, Jim's meeting
with his teacher, your Thursday lunch, Frank's early morning swim. Such
physical-behavioral units may repeat themselves (may exist in many copies).
They</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">are common phenomenal entities,
and they are natural units in no way imposed by an investigator. To laymen
they are as objective as rivers and forests - <i>they are parts of the
objective environment that are experienced directly as rain and sandy beaches
are experienced</i>. (Barker 1968, p. 11, emphasis added)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Such physical-behavioral units are of inestimable
importance for an understanding of human cognition and action since almost
all human behavior occurs within them. All biographies are ordered in terms
of them. All trials, all theatrical performances, all religious rituals,
are composed out of behavior settings. Even our journeys from site to site,
and our loungings in daydream mode between quests, even the contexts in
which we reflect scientifically on problems of ecological psychology or
carry out experiments in psychology laboratories, are recognizable as physical-behavioral
units in Barker's terms. Even our more or less unsuccessful <i>attempts</i>
to engage in standard activities can be understood for what they are only
in terms of an independent prevalence of physical-behavioral units of the
corresponding, full-fledged type - for it is only in relation to the latter
that our attempts are determined as attempts and our successes distinguished
from our failures.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Psychological factors are at work in determining
which of the available repertoire of behavior settings we are in fact occupying
(in determining which <i>selection</i> from biophysical reality is our
behavior setting of the moment). But such factors, trivially, do not in
every case operate in transparent fashion. That is, we may (like the rider
on Lake Constance) be mistaken in our beliefs about the behavior setting
we are inhabiting. Such errors do not, contrary to the views of phenomenologists
and methodological solipsists, generate special objects of their own.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Prehistory of Environment Settings</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Serious investigations of environmental
settings in the history of philosophy are sorely lacking. The theory of
the<i> </i>life world set forth by Husserl in the <i>Crisis</i> is a first,
informal approximation to an ontological theory of the requisite sort.
But Husserl, too, stops short of any full realist commitment to what he
calls the 'surrounding environment,' and the relation of the latter to
physical things in space is hardly clarified in this work.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The neglect of environmental settings in
the literature of philosophy turns first of all on the tendency among philosophers
to prefer simplified ontologies - often, indeed, to embrace one or other
form of ontological monism - where environmental settings transcend the
boundaries between familiar ontological categories in radical fashion.
Even those philosophers with the ambition to come to grips with the realm
of common sense have shown a tendency to adopt philosophies which reduce
this realm - on the pattern of the doctrine of 'logical constructions'
- to objects of a suitably monistic flavor. The Wittgensteinian conception
of the common-sense world in terms of 'language games' is an improvement
on monistic theories. Unfortunately, however, it puts the cart before the
horse. This is first of all because language, too, is a phenomenon which
can be understood only within the framework of an ontological theory of
environmental settings - where language gets used such usage itself is
under all normal circumstances embedded within physical-behavioral units
of one or other familiar sort (conversation, argument, warning, instruction,
and so on). But it is also, and more importantly, because to seek an account
of our human common-sense reality in terms of language, as some Wittgensteinians
have been wont to do, is to attempt to explain the whole in terms of one
relatively late-developed part. Thus it is to place obstacles in the path
of accounting for those many features of human behavior which are shared
also by non-human animals.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The neglect of environmental settings turns
also on the dominance through the ages of foundationalist ideas in epistemology:
for environmental settings - my evening soup, your Tuesday swim, the 5
o'clock train to Long Island - belong <i>par excellence</i> to the realm
of mere 'appearance' in Plato's sense. Hence, erroneously, it has been
concluded either that such objects are not amenable to rigorous treatment,
whether philosophical or scientific, or that the given objects do not exist
at all.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b>Ontological Properties of Environmental settings</b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Each physical-behavioral unit has two
sorts of components: human beings behaving in certain ways (lecturing,
sitting, listening, eating), and non-psychological objects with which behavior
is transacted (keyboards, levers, scalpels, etc.). Each physical-behavioral
unit has a boundary which separates an organized internal foreground pattern
from an external background running on behind it. Each physical-behavioral
unit is circumjacent to its components, which means that the former surrounds
(encloses, encompasses) the latter without a break: the pupils and equipment
are <i>in
</i>the class; the shop opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 6 p.m.
The pertinent enclosing portion of reality may not be set apart physically
from its neighbors. The line, or zone, of demarcation may be determined
psychologically. (Consider, for example, the question whether some given
action of the groom within the church is or is not a part of that physical-behavioral
unit which is his wedding.) The <i>significance</i> of the resultant demarcated
portion of reality, too, is a psychological matter. But the resultant demarcated
portion <i>exists
</i>as part of reality nonetheless. Environmental settings
are thus in some ways analogous to geopolitical objects such as Poland
or Dade County: such objects, too, are the products of more or less arbitrary
demarcation on the part of human beings - they are 'fiat' or gerrymandered
objects; but they exist as parts of physical reality nonetheless.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Physical-behavioral units are characteristically
self-regulating, and are such as to guide their components to characteristic
states and to maintain those states within limited ranges in face of disturbances.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
Slight modifications within given dimensions of the unit can be sustained
without detriment to its continued existence as a unit of this type, but
the total behavior making up the unit - for example a Rotary Club meeting
- cannot be greatly changed without its being destroyed. The meeting must
contain an introduction; there must be a speech, there must be listening
and discussion. Within the meeting, there are the subparts: chairman, speaker,
discussant, audience (as within the sentence there are the subparts: subject,
verb, noun, rising inflection, and so on).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For Gibson, reality as a whole is a complex
hierarchy of such inter-nested levels of parts and sub-parts: molecules
are nested within cells, cells are nested within leaves, leaves are nested
within trees, trees are nested within forests, forests are nested within
Special Federal Forest Protection Zones, and so on.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>
Each type of organism is then <i>tuned</i> in its perception and action
to objects on a specific level within this complex hierarchy - to objects
('affordances') which are the environmental correlates of adapted traits
on the side of the organism and which together form what Gibson calls the
organism's 'ecological niche'.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup> A niche
is that into which an animal <i>fits </i>(as a hand fits into a well-fitting
glove). The niche is that in relation to which the animal is habituated
in its behavior.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup> It embraces not only
things of different sorts, but also shapes, textures, boundaries (surfaces,
edges), all of which are organized in such a way as to enjoy affordance-character
for the animal in question in the sense that they are relevant to its survival.
The given features motivate the organism; they are such as to intrude upon
its life, to stimulate the organism in a range of different ways.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The perceptions and actions of human beings
are likewise tuned<i> </i>to the characteristic shapes and qualities and
patterns of behavior of our own respective (mesoscopic) environments. This
mutual embranglement is however in our case extended further via artefacts
such as microscopes and telescopes, and via cultural phenomena such as
languages and institutions of law and politics. To learn a language is
in part to extend the range of objects in relation to which we are able
spontaneously to adjust our behavior and thus it is to extend radically
the types of niche or setting into which we can spontaneously fit.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Transcategoriality of Physical-Behavioral
Units</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">In Book II of his <i>Ideas</i> Husserl
utilizes ideas very much like these in order to provide an account not
only of the environment of our everyday practical concerns but also of
the special disciplinary environments of, for example, historians, natural
scientists, and mathematicians. What he does not resolve in any adequate
way is the issue of the interrelations between these various environments.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>
He does not address, either, the various ways in which our environment
of the moment may comprehend radically heterogeneous elements drawn from
a variety of different domains. Physical-behavioral units are, we said,
such as to transcend the boundaries between familiar ontological categories.
Consider a physical-behavioral unit such as a religious meeting, a tennis
championship or a sea battle. Each of these is an intricate complex of
times, places, actions, and things. Its constituents can include both man-made
elements (buildings, streets, cricket fields, books, pianos, libraries,
the bridges and engine-rooms of battleships) and also natural features
(hills, lakes, waves, particular climatic features, patterns of light and
sound, the movements and gestures of other human beings, pheromones).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The physical-behavioral unit comprehends
things and behavior, but it may, through these, comprehend also a variety
of additional, non-physical components. Thus the unit may comprehend for
example different types of linguistic, legal and institutional elements,
all combined together in space and time in highly specific ways.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>
Its constituent parts will in addition be diverse not only as concerns
their material constitution but also as concerns their ontological form:
thus each unit will comprehend continuants (substances), events, processes,
actions, states and manifold relations between all of these.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As Barker puts it:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The conceptual incommensurability
of phenomena which is such an obstacle to the unification of the sciences
does not appear to trouble nature's units. - Within the larger units, things
and events from conceptually more and more alien sciences are incorporated
and regulated. (Barker 1968, p. 155)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">As far as our behavior is concerned, even
the most radical diversity of kinds and categories need not prevent integration.
Moreover, if perception and action are, as we have argued, dependent features
of the total subject-environment relation, then the transcategoriality
of environments will imply also a transcategoriality of perception and
action, of a sort which will add yet further weight to the obstacles standing
in the way of a science of perception and action of any standardly recognizable
sort (and pose problems, too, for any simple version of the identity-theoretic
account of the relation between mind and brain).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Is Gibson a Realist?</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Because human environments are, as we
saw, radically transcategorial, it follows that a science of human environments
will look very different from any science of the more standard sort. This,
too, might lead us to suppose that environments, settings, physical-behavioral
units are phenomena only - that they are subjective constructs, properly
to be treated within the framework of a representationalist or methodologically
solipsistic psychology. The challenge, as Gibson saw, is to develop a realist
science of environmental settings which will be '<i>consistent</i> with
physics, mechanics, optics, acoustics, and chemistry' by taking seriously
the idea that ecological facts are 'facts of higher order that have never
been made explicit by these sciences and have gone unrecognized.' (Gibson
1979, p. 17) He uses the term 'ecology' precisely in order to designate
the discipline that should encompass these higher-order facts; it is 'a
blend of physics, geology, biology, archeology, and anthropology, but with
an attempt at unification' on the basis of the question: what can stimulate
the organism? (Gibson 1966, p. 21)</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Gibson thus stands out from the bulk of
contemporary psychologists in rejecting all varieties of representationalism
in favor of a position he calls 'direct realism' according to which (once
again:) we are, as a result of adaptation, bound up directly and spontaneously
in our normal psychological experience with the objects themselves in the
physical world. We ourselves form part of the physical environment.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a puzzle, however. For Gibson's
ecological perspective is in other respects however very close to the phenomenological
theories of the life world referred to above, theories which have been
held to dictate precisely a representationalist reading. In an important
paper entitled "Is Gibson a Relativist?" Stuart Katz helps us to understand
how this apparent conflict could have arisen by drawing attention to passages
in Gibson's work which seem to negate the standard realist interpretation
of his views and thus draw him closer to the phenomenologists. Katz points
in particular to the following characteristic statements from Gibson's
<i>Ecological
Approach to Visual Perception</i>:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">… animal<i> </i>and <i>environment
</i>make
an inseparable pair. Each term implies the other. No animal could exist
without an environment surrounding it. Equally, although not so obvious,
an environment implies an animal (or at least an organism) to be surrounded.
(1979, p. 8)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The <i>affordances</i> of the environment
are what it <i>offers</i> the animal, what it
<i>provides</i> or <i>furnishes,
</i>whether
for good or ill. - I mean by [affordance] something that refers to both
the environment and the animal in a way that no existing term does. It
implies the complementarity of the animal and the environment. (1979, p.
127)</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">… an affordance is neither an
objective property nor a subjective property; or it is both if you like.
An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective. - It is
both physical and psychical, yet neither (1979, p. 129).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">These passages dictate, according to Katz,
a reading of Gibson according to which (as according to Uexk&uuml;ll) different
species <i>live in different worlds</i>. Water is for you and me a substance;
for fish it is a medium which substances inhabit. Hence the question arises:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do terrestrial animals perceive water correctly
and aquatic species incorrectly, or vice versa? Gibson as relativist tells
us no. Each lives in a different world and, complementarily, each perceives
differently. Water is a substance in one world and a medium in another;
it is not absolutely substance, nor is it absolutely medium. 'The animal
and its environment, remember, are reciprocal terms.' One could never say
what water is, without saying for whom it is, and conversely. (Katz 1987,
p. 120)</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">Reasons for Representationalism</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Whether valid or not, Katz's argument
is significant. If it is valid, then this implies that Husserlians of an
orthodox stripe can claim a hitherto unrecognized ally among experimental
psychologists. If, on the other hand, the argument is flawed, then in coming
to understand why this is so, we will discover which modifications of standard
Husserlian views must be made if we are to bring them into harmony with
Gibsonian realism and thus to generate a position properly deserving the
name 'Husserlian ecology'.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">To see which of these two alternatives
is correct, we note that there are two principal motivations for representationalist
views of perception: (1) the problem of
<i>error</i>, and (2) the problem
of seeming global incompatibilities between different systems of representations.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The existence of perceptual error, according
to familiar arguments (involving bent sticks and like phenomena), reveals
that perception itself cannot be solely a product of sensory inputs. It
tells us that, on occasion at least, for example in cases of hallucination,
perceptual objects are in some sense created or constituted by or with
the help of the perceiver. A perceptual representationalist is one who
holds that the objects that are given in perception are always constructed
or constituted in this sense (hence they belong to a special world, a world
of representations). The representationalist is thus able to do justice
to the fact of perceptual error without abandoning the goal of a unified
theory of perception, but only at the price of cutting off his theory from
any roots in the real world of mind-independent objects. The realist solution
to the problem of error, on the other hand, denies that what is phenomenologically
experienced as the unitary phenomenon of perception is in fact a unitary
matter at all. Rather, we must distinguish two types of perceptual setup,
and correspondingly two distinct tasks for the theory of perception. On
the one hand is the task of providing a theory of perception in the strict
sense - a theory of successful, veridical, world-embrangled perception
of the normal sort. On the other hand is the quite different task of giving
an account of perceptual error (of the different types of shortfall from
this standard, veridical case).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The second motivation for representationalism
might be formulated as follows: our common-sense perceptual space has a
Euclidean structure (or a structure closely related thereto); the space
of the physicist has another, quite different structure; and it may well
be that the perceptual spaces of mice, of spiders, of clams, have other
structures again. Not all of these structures can be <i>true of</i> space
as it is in itself. Hence, the argument proceeds, our (and the mouse's,
and the spider's) perceptual spaces are mere 'representations'. And what
goes for space holds for other features of the manifold environments of
perception, too, so that, again, it is as if each species lives in its
own special world.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a constructivist, relativist, projectivist,
Kantianist conclusion of this sort which Katz attributes to Gibson. But,
to remain with Katz's own preferred example, space (as we may here assume)
is a continuum. Like all continua it can be partitioned in a range of mutually
incompatible ways (as a cheese can be sliced in such a way as to produce
either triangular or rectangular or disk-shaped segments but not all of
these at once). All members of a family of mutually conflicting 'perceptual
spaces', now, may very well turn out to be compatible after all, if they
can be interpreted as expressing distinct <i>partitions</i>, for example
partitions on different levels of granularity, of one and the same reality.
In this way the second motive for representationalism may be resisted,
too, and with it also the argument put forward by Katz for a representationalist
reading of Gibson.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">The Big Cheese</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Times New Roman">Just as the world of physical-behavioral
units is for Barker organized hierarchically in terms of circumjacent and
subjacent components, so for Gibson, reality in general is a complex hierarchy
of internested levels of parts and sub-parts. But neither Barker nor Gibson
has at his disposal a theory of <i>parts</i> or <i>components</i> and of
the wholes into which they are nested; neither has, in other words, a <i>mereology</i>,<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup>
in terms of which it would be possible for them to formulate an overarching
account of the ways parts can fit together within their respective environments
and of how environments themselves can fit together in a larger, hierarchically
organized order. It is for this reason, I want to argue, that the ecological
approach appears to fall victim to the argument of Katz.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">With the resources of a general mereology,
however (of a sort sketched already by Husserl in the third of his <i>Logical
Investigations</i>), we are in a position to comprehend within a single
theoretical framework what is involved when one and the same reality is
partitioned in distinct, cross-cutting ways by organisms or cognitive subjects
approaching this reality each from its own particular perspective.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mereology allows us to do justice to the
ways in which, in the realm of environmental settings, entities of radically
different sorts are able to become unified together into wholes: the unity
in question is at least in part a unity of psychological demarcation (it
is analogous, as we suggested above, to the unity involved in the geopolitical
realm, where even spatially widely scattered entities such as Indonesia
or the United States are able to enjoy the status of unitary wholes even
in the absence of any physical unification of their parts).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mereology allows us finally to understand,
in full conformity with the realist perspective, how different languages,
different theories, and different systems of animal behavior and perception
are able to generate their own precisely fitting partitions of one single
reality. The various animal behavior-systems generate partitions of reality
into <i>ecological niches</i>. Human perception and action together generate
that mesoscopic partition of reality we call the common-sense world. And
other sorts of partitioning of reality are generated, for example, by the
acts of physicists, paleontologists, historians, and even mathematicians.
(The mathematician, we might say, is tuned to form.) Each such group of
disciplinary specialists lives in its own precisely tailored disciplinary
world, its precisely fitting surrounding environment, exactly in the way
described by Husserl in <i>Ideas </i>II. Now, however, we can understand
how this multiplication of environments can be fully compatible with the
realist perspective and with the hypothesis of a single, common world.
The ultimate ontology will be scientific, but that it will have room not
only for physics but also for mesoscopic structures built up on the basis
of physics, e.g. structures of the type to which human behaviour and perception
are tuned. The realistic science of organisms, biology, needs as its counterpart
a realistic science of environments.</font>
