<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br />The paper defends a view of perceptual acts as real relations of a
subject to an object. To make this view coherent, a theory of different
types of relations is developed, resting on ideas on formal ontology put
forward by Husserl in his <i>Logical Investigations</i> and on the theory
of relations sketched in my "<a href="/smith/articles/acta/acta.htm">Acta
cum fundamentis in re</a>". The theory is applied to the notion of a Cambridge
change, which proves to have an unforeseen relevance to our understanding
of perception.
