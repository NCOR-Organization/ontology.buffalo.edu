<blockquote>
<blockquote>Some would conceive philosophy as being divided into Analytic
and Continental. This, as John Searle points out, is rather like conceiving
America as being divided into Business and Kansas. Searle&rsquo;s wise saying
has not, as yet, received the theoretical attention it deserves. In both
cases we have a certain domain, which is conceived as being divided into
two parts, one defined in spatial terms, the other defined in terms of
objects, practices or features widely spread through some spatial area.
<p>What follows is a theory of such divides (a general, ontological theory
of us and them, of here and there, of the Hegemonic Colonizing Self and
the Indigenous Colonized Other). It begins with a simple mereotopological
account of the sorts of divisions which are possible in the spatial domain,
focusing especially on examples derived from geopolitics. It moves from
there to investigate how this account would have to be extended to do justice
in realist fashion to the ontology of divides in general, and concludes
with a brief defense of the realist approach to large-scale social aggregates
against deconstructionist criticisms.
