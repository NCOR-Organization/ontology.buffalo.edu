The concept of niche (context, setting, habitat) has been little studied by
ontologists, in spite of the wide application of this and similar concepts 
in a variety of disciplines, from evolutionary biology to economics. What 
follows is a first formal theory of the niche, a theory of objects in their 
settings. The theory builds upon existing work on mereology, topology and 
the theory of spatial location as tools of formal ontology. Our mereotopological 
theory of the niche will be illustrated above all by means of simple biological 
examples, but the concept of niche should be understood as being, like concepts
such as part, boundary, and location, a formal concept, one that is applicable
in principle to a wide range of different domains.</blockquote>
