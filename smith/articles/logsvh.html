<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">1. The Province of Logic</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Those who conceive logic as a science
have generally favoured one of two alternative conceptions as to what the
subject-matter of this science ought to be. On the one hand is the nowadays
somewhat old-fashioned-seeming view of logic as the science of judgment,
or of thinking or reasoning activities in general. On the other hand is
the view of logic as a science of ideal meanings, 'thoughts', or 'propositions
in themselves'. There is, however, a third alternative conception, which
enjoyed only a brief flowering in the years leading up to the first World
War, but whose lingering presence can be detected in the background of
more recent ontologising trends in logic, as for example in the 'situation
semantics' of Barwise and Perry. This third conception sees logic as a
science of special objects called '<I>Sachverhalte</I>' or 'states of affairs'.
A view of this sort is present in simplified form in the works of Meinong,
but it received its definitive formulation in the writings of Adolf Reinach,
a student of Husserl who is otherwise noteworthy for having anticipated,
in a monograph of 1913, large chunks of what later became known as the
theory of speech acts.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The laws of logic, according to Reinach,
are 'nothing other than general principles expressing relations between
states of affairs'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP> The fundamental principles
of traditional logic - for example that two contradictory judgments cannot
both be correct - are, Reinach claims, derived and not primitive principles.
For:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A judgment is correct if the state
of affairs corresponding to it subsists; and two contradictory judgments
cannot both be correct <I>because</I> two contradictory states of affairs
cannot both subsist. The law relating to judgments thus obtains its foundation
from the corresponding law relating to states of affairs.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Our task here will be to establish how and
why this <I>Sachverhalt-based</I> conception of logic arose within the
circle of philosophers influenced by Brentano and Husserl. An attempt will
then be made to draw some first implications for our contemporary understanding
of logic and semantics from an examination of this hitherto neglected slice
of philosophical history. Anticipating somewhat, we shall argue that an
adequate science of logic would be one which would somehow manage to do
justice to all three conceptions simultaneously. For on the one hand it
seems that logic must have some relation to our empirical activities of
thinking and inferring, and this primarily via the meanings or 'thoughts'
which these activities instantiate. On the other hand however it seems
that logic relates to thoughts and judgments only insofar as the latter
are able to stand in that sort of relation to objects we call truth. If,
now, we take the <I>Sachverhalt</I> as that on the side of the objects
to which true thoughts or judgments correspond, then <I>Sachverhalte</I>,
too, must fall within the province of logic.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">2. Prehistory of the <I>Sachverhalt</I></FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Traces of the <I>Sachverhalt</I> concept
are discoverable by hindsight already in Aristotle, above all in those
passages where Aristotle speaks of the <I>pragma</I> as that on which the
truth of the <I>logos</I> depends.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP> Aquinas,
too, takes the 'disposition of things' as the cause of the truth of a judgment,<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP>
and similar views are present in the later middle ages, for example in
the doctrine of the <I>complexe</I> <I>significabile</I> - of that which
can be signified only as a complex - defended by Wodeham, Crathorn and
Gregory of Rimini.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Etymologically speaking, however, both
'<I>Sachverhalt</I>' and 'state of affairs' derive not from these sources
but from juridical uses of the term '<I>status'</I> in the sense of <I>status
rerum</I> (state or constitution of things), as contrasted with the <I>status
hominum</I> or state of a man (as slave, free, etc.). Thus the O.E.D. speaks
of a 'state of things' or 'state of affairs' as 'the way in which events
or circumstances stand disposed (at a particular time or within a particular
sphere).'</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The term '<I>status rerum</I>' is rooted
especially in that branch of rhetorical theory which relates to the conduct
of a trial. Here <I>status</I> is defined as the question which grows out
of a given legal conflict. Thus for example Quintilian writes: 'What I
call <I>status</I> is called by others constitution, by others question,
and by others that which one can infer from the question.'<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP>
'<I>Status'</I> in this connection signifies also in an extended sense
'the way things stand, the condition or peculiarity of a thing in regard
to its circumstances, position, order'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP>
An important role seems to have been played here by Goclenius, who draws
a clear opposition between '<I>status'</I> and '<I>propositio</I>' from
the point of view of the science of law. The <I>status</I> is, he says,
'the fulcrum about which turn both the representations of the prosecution
and those of the defence.'<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP> The court's
job is to determine which of these conflicting representations is true;
in other words, it has to determine <I>how things stand</I> in regard to
the matters raised therein.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The term '<I>Sachverhalt</I>' makes its
first technical appearance in the German philosophical literature in a
work published in 1879 entitled <I>General Logic</I> by Julius Bergmann,
a philosopher close to Hermann Lotze, who defended a doctrine referred
to as 'objective idealism'. The more usual sort of idealism current in
Germany at the time when Bergmann was writing conceives the objects of
experience and knowledge as being quite literally located 'in the mind'
of the knowing subject. Windelband, for example, can define idealism in
this sense as 'the dissolution of being into processes of consciousness'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As far as judgment is concerned, the idealists
embraced the so-called 'combination theory', according to which the process
of judging is a process of combining or separating concepts or presentations.
Positive judging is the putting together of a complex of concepts, usually
a pair consisting of <I>subject</I> and <I>predicate</I>. Before the rise
of idealism, it had been assumed as a matter of course that the resultant
conceptual complex may reflect an exactly parallel combination of truth-making
objects in the world. Ever since Aristotle it had been assumed also that
the phenomenon of judgment could be properly understood only within a framework
within which this wider background of ontology is taken into account. The
idealists, however, broke with both of these assumptions and substituted
instead the thesis that the process of judging is to be understood entirely
from the perspective of what takes place within the consciousness of the
judging subject.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The combination-theory, which had once
been accepted by idealists but indeed by almost all philosophers,<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP>
shows its most positive side in Leibniz's experiments in the direction
of a combinatorial logic. Towards the end of the 19th century, however,
in part as a result of its association with the immanentistic views of
the idealists, the theory began to be recognised as problematic. Above
all, it appeared to be incapable of coping with existential and impersonal
judgments like 'cheetahs exist', 'it's raining', and so on, in relation
to which, because the judgments in question seem to have only one single
member, combination or unification is excluded. Moreover, even in those
cases where judging might be held to involve a combination of concepts
or presentations, the need was felt for some further moment of affirmation
or conviction - some 'consciousness of validity' in the idealists' terminology,
or 'assertive force' in the language of Frege - in order that the theory
should be able to cope with hypothetical and other logically compound judgments
in which complex concepts or presentations seem to be present as proper
parts without themselves being judged.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">At the same time, however, it began to
become clear that to do justice to the truth of judgments it would be necessary
to recognise once more some objective standard, transcendent to the judgment,
against which its truth could be measured. If judging involves a combination
of concepts, then it must involve also the conviction that there is some
transcendent something on the side of the object corresponding to the conceptual
unity thereby produced. Moreover, the truth of a judgment must involve
there actually being some transcendent something of this sort. Attempts
were therefore made to come to terms with such objectual correlates, to
establish what, exactly, the objectual something is, which gets 'posited
as a unity' in our acts of judging.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The objective idealism of Lotze and Bergmann,
now, is part of this move to break out of the confines of immanentistic
idealism and to free logic from its bondage to the mental. Bergmann's <I>Sachverhalt</I>
has precisely the role of the objective component, the <I>res</I>, with
which the <I>intellectus</I> has to stand in <I>adaequatio</I>. Knowledge
he conceives as that thinking 'whose thought content is in harmony with
the <I>Sachverhalt</I>, and is therefore true'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP>
Bergmann's usage of '<I>Sachverhalt</I>' finds a partial echo in Lotze's
own <I>Logic</I> of 1880, where Lotze introduces his treatment of judgment
by distinguishing, in addition to purely immanent relations between presentations
also 'material relations' ('<I>sachliche</I> <I>Verh&auml;ltnisse</I>')
between what he calls the 'contents' of presentations. It is only 'because
one already presupposes such a material relation as obtaining,' Lotze writes,
'that one can picture it in a sentence [<I>in einem Satze abbilden</I>].'<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Both Lotze and Bergmann are here feeling
their way towards a view of the objective standard or target of judgment
as transcendent to the mind of the judging subject. In Lotze himself this
culminates in a Platonistic view of the objects of judgment along lines
more familiar from the work of Bolzano and Frege. (The latter, we might
say, make a Platonic object out of the conceptual complex of the idealists.)
But it was not only by Frege that Lotzean ideas on the objects of judgment
were developed. Lotze's lectures were attended also by the two Brentanists
Carl Stumpf and Anton Marty, both of whom will have a role to play in the
story that follows. It was in fact Stumpf's employment of the term '<I>Sachverhalt</I>'
in his logic lectures of 1888 which sparked the various <I>Sachverhalt-ontologies</I>
put forward by the followers of Brentano around the turn of the century.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">3. Brentanian Immanentism</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Brentano, too, embraces elements of the
immanentistic doctrine of the idealists. He goes beyond them, however,
in his thesis that all acts are directed towards objects. This is Brentano's
much-mooted 'principle of the intentionality of the mental'. Rarely, however,
has this principle been properly understood. Note, first of all, that it
does not assert that all acts are directed towards objects <I>in their
own right</I>. Some borrow their directedness from other acts on which
they are founded. It is in fact 'presentations', for Brentano, which do
the job of securing directedness to objects in every case.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP>
A presentation is any act in which the subject is conscious of an object
without taking up any position with regard to it. Such an act may be either
intuitive or conceptual. That is, we can have an object before our mind
either in sensory experience (and in variant forms thereof in imagination),
or conceptually - for example when we think of the concepts colour or pain
in general. Presentations may be either (relatively) simple or (relatively)
complex, a distinction recalling the British empiricists' doctrine of simple
and complex ideas. A simple presentation is for example that of a red sensum;
a complex presentation that of an array of differently coloured squares.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP>
Here, as in every other case, the presentation <I>is</I> a relation to
an object.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On the basis of a presentation, now, new
sorts of relations to objects of these sorts are built up. Above all, such
objects can be <I>accepted</I> (in positive judgments) or <I>rejected</I>
(in negative judgments). To the simple manner of being related to an object
in presentation, in other words, there may come to be added one of two
diametrically opposed modes of relating to this object, which we call 'acceptance'
and 'rejection' respectively. A judgment is, somewhat crudely put, either
the belief or the disbelief in the existence of an object given in presentation.
This is the famous existential theory of judgment defended by Brentano.
Its importance consists not least in the fact that it is the first influential
alternative to the combination theory, a theory that had for so long remained
unchallenged.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">'Object', in the Brentanian context, is
to be understood simply as: 'correlate of presentation',<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP>
a notion embracing in particular simple and complex data of sense. Thus
when Brentano talks of 'objects', he is not referring to putative transcendent
targets of mental acts. As we can see by reflecting on the acts involved
in reading fiction or on those cases where our acts rest on mistaken presuppositions
of existence, the thesis that all mental acts are directed to objects in
this sense, to objects external to the mind, is clearly false.<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP>
Brentano is referring, rather, to immanent 'objects of thought', and in
fact no distinction is drawn in Brentano's treatment in the <I>Psychology</I>
between 'content', and 'object' in this sense. That which is thought of
has, he insists, a merely derivative being. The act of thought is something
real (a real event or process); but the object of thought has being only
to the extent that the act which thinks it has being. The object of thought
is according to its nature something non-real which dwells in [<I>innewohnt</I>]
a real substance (a thinker).<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Confusion on this matter has reigned in
the secondary literature on Brentano above all because his own statement
of the intentionality principle in the oft-quoted passage from the <I>Psychology</I>
(pp. 88f.) is not entirely clear. Brentano himself however appends a footnote
to this passage in which he states explicitly that for him the intentionality
relation holds always between an act and an object immanent to the mind.
He points out that 'Aristotle himself had spoken of this mental in-existence',
and he goes on to elaborate Aristotle's theory according to which 'the
object which is thought is in the thinking intellect.' This same thesis
is to be found also in Brentano's more detailed formulations of his views
in the <I>Descriptive Psychology</I>, where 'immanent objects' are explicitly
assigned to what Brentano calls the 'parts of the soul in the strict or
literal sense'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Even on the immanentistic reading, however,
Brentano's intentionality principle is not without its problems. It faces
difficulties especially in dealing with negative existential judgments
such as 'God does not exist', which seem, on the face of it, both to have
and to lack an object. It was as part of an attempt to solve these difficulties
that Brentano and his immediate successors began to reconsider the original
thesis that acts of judgment get their objects (contents, matters) from
underlying acts of presentation.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">4. From Objects to <I>Sachverhalte</I></FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The concept of object, for the Brentanists,
arises when one moves from the psychology of presentation to the investigation
of its objectual correlate. The concept of a state of affairs arises, similarly,
when one moves from the psychology of judgment to the investigation of
the ontological correlates of judging acts. Given Brentano's existential
theory of judgment, it turns out that such ontological correlates are initially
seen by his followers as of the forms: <I>the existence of A</I> and <I>the
non-existence of A</I>, but other types of judgment-correlate were also
recognised: <I>the subsistence of A, the possibility of A, the necessity
of A, the probability of A, the being B of A</I>, and so on.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As Stumpf himself later recorded, the term
'<I>Sachverhalt</I>' was introduced by him in 1888 to stand for a 'specific
content of a judgment',</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">which is to be distinguished from
the content of a presentation (the matter) and is expressed linguistically
in 'that-clauses' or in substantivised infinitives.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A copy of Stumpf's notes to his logic lectures
of 1888 has survived in the Husserl Archive in Louvain, where we read:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">From the matter of the judgment
we distinguish its content, the <I>Sachverhalt</I> that is expressed in
the judgment. For example 'God is' has for its matter God, for its content:
the existence of God. 'There is no God' has the same matter but its content
is: non-existence of God. (MS Q 13, p. 4)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Together with concepts and sets or aggregates,
the <I>Sachverhalt</I> is assigned by Stumpf to the category of what he
calls 'formations' (<I>Gebilde</I>). These are to be distinguished first
of all from what Stumpf calls 'functions', i.e. from our mental acts themselves.
But they are to be distinguished also from 'appearances', i.e. from sense
data as classically conceived, and Stumpf is in fact here still operating
within the broadly empiricist framework within which it is sense data which
serve as the typical examples of objects of presentation. The latter, as
Stumpf conceives them, are given to us as independent of the activities
of mind. As organised or collected, however - for example as they occur
in the context of an aggregate or set - they are taken up into consciousness
in such a way that they are given to us as existing only as immanent to
the relevant (in this case aggregating) act. A Stumpfian state of affairs,
similarly, can exist only as the 'immanent content' of an actually occurring
judgment. Hence it cannot 'be given directly and thus be real of itself
alone, independently of any function.' <I>Sachverhalte</I>, like other
Stumpfian formations, 'are factual only as contents of functions.'<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21)</A></SUP>
They</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">are not to be found anywhere separated
off ... in some 'supersensible realm' as entities existing in and of themselves.
They do not exist as dead preparations or petrifactions, but only in the
context of the living being of the mind.<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">5. Content and Object</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Brentano and Stumpf have hereby reached
a new sort of sophistication as concerns the objects of our cognitive acts.
And this has allowed them successfully to break away from the combination
theory of judgment. Their shared immanentism meant however that they were
still unable to achieve clarity as to the relations between mental acts
and objects in the world, and this precluded also a conception of the ways
in which judgments may come to be made true by such objects.<SUP><A HREF="#N_23_">(23)</A></SUP>
Their immanentism precluded also a conception of the contents of judgment
and of the meanings of sentences of a sort that would be fruitful for the
purposes of modern logic. It is in this respect Kasimir Twardowski, another
student of Brentano's, who makes the crucial break with the core thesis
of the immanentistic position. In his <I>On the Content and Object of Presentations
</I>of
1894,<SUP><A HREF="#N_24_">(24)</A></SUP> Twardowski puts forward a series
of arguments in defence of a distinction between the contents of presenting
acts on the one hand, and their objects, on the other. The object of presentation
he conceives broadly as a transcendent target of the act. The content he
conceives as something like a mental 'picture' or 'image' of the object.
Every act has, he claims, both a content and an object, though the object
of an act need not in every case exist. Even non-existent objects are,
however, seen by Twardowski as having properties of their own, a doctrine
later transmuted by Meinong into the 'principle of the independence of
being from being-so' and in this form taken as the basis of Meinong's theory
of non-existent objects.<SUP><A HREF="#N_25_">(25)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The distinction between content and object
is initially drawn by Twardowski for presentations only. The act of judgment
has a special <I>content</I> of its own, but in <I>On the Content and Object
of Presentations</I> this act is still seen as inheriting its <I>object</I>
from the relevant underlying presentation. Three years later, however,
in a letter to Meinong, Twardowski suggests that one should recognise also
a special object of the judging act, in addition to the judgment-content.<SUP><A HREF="#N_26_">(26)</A></SUP>
He thereby effected a generalisation of the content-object distinction
to the sphere of judging acts, in a way which yields a schema of the following
sort:</FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">One consequence of Brentano's
immanentism is that judgments are conceived as real events in a way that
leaves no room for any view of truth and falsity as timeless properties
of judgments. This conclusion Brentano takes to imply that God, too, if
he is omniscient, must exist in time, since the knowledge of which judgments
are true and false must change from moment to moment.<SUP><A HREF="#N_27_">(27)</A></SUP>
Here, too, Twardowski moves in the direction of a view more adequate to
the purposes of modern logic. In his paper "On So-Called Relative Truth"
of 1902, he argues forcefully in favour of a conception of truth as something
absolute, a conception which would rule out the possibility that the truth
of a judgment might change from occasion to occasion or from subject to
subject.<SUP><A HREF="#N_28_">(28)</A></SUP> Brentano's acceptance of the
thesis that truth can change and judgment remain the same follows, Twardowski
argues, from a confusion of <I>judgments</I> on the one hand with their
<I>statements</I>
or <I>expressions</I> on the other. Twardowski's argument here - which
again reveals the influence of Bolzano<SUP><A HREF="#N_29_">(29)</A></SUP>
- is to be found in different forms in the work of Frege and Russell, as
also in the <I>Tractatus</I>, for example in Wittgenstein's remark to the
effect that language 'disguises thought. So much so, that from the outward
form of the clothing it is impossible to infer the form of the thought
beneath it' (4.002). In Twardowski's formulation, however, this argument
is part of an attempt to come to an understanding of the mental acts involved
in judging and of the ontological correlates of such acts. Thus Twardowski
is not, like Frege, Russell or Wittgenstein, attracted by the more ambitious
task of building an ideal or artificial language in which thought and its
expression would coincide. True to the Brentanist heritage, his efforts
are directed to the things and processes that are involved in actual judgings,
not to the construction of abstract models thereof. For all this, however,
Twardowski's emphasis on the notion of absolute truth can be shown to have
pointed his students in the direction of a truth-functional conception
of logic in the modern sense. Further steps would however have to be taken
before there could come into being among Twardowski's students in Poland
a fully-fledged logic of propositions of the sort we now take for granted.<SUP><A HREF="#N_30_">(30)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">6. <I>Sachverhalt</I> and Proposition</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Meinong, too, in his <I>On Assumptions</I>,
defends an opposition between two sorts of entity: objects and objectives,
distinguishing not only between positive and negative objectives of being
(<I>that A is, that A is not</I>), but also between positive and negative
objectives of so-being (<I>that A is B, that A is not B</I>), as also between
objectives constituted by objects and 'objectives of higher order' constituted
by further objectives of lower order. Truth, possibility and also probability
are, according to Meinong, attributes not of objects but of objectives,<SUP><A HREF="#N_31_">(31)</A></SUP>
and as already intimated, it is objectives which provide the subject matter
for the science of logic as Meinong conceives it.<SUP><A HREF="#N_32_">(32)</A></SUP>
As Reinach remarks, however, there is a fundamental objection which must
be raised against Meinong, namely 'that his concept of objective runs together
the two completely different concepts of proposition (in the logical sense)
and state of affairs.'<SUP><A HREF="#N_33_">(33)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Clarity in respect of the distinctions
between <I>Sachverhalt</I> and proposition, as also between both of these
and the immanent contents of judgment was first attained by Husserl in
his <I>Logical</I> <I>Investigations</I> of 1900/01.<SUP><A HREF="#N_34_">(34)</A></SUP>
Here <I>Sachverhalt</I> and proposition are squeezed apart, and a conception
of <I>Sachverhalte</I> as objectual <I>truth-makers</I> explicitly defended.<SUP><A HREF="#N_35_">(35)</A></SUP>
Husserl argued for a view of <I>Sachverhalte</I> as objectual judgment-correlates
analogous to objects as the transcendent targets of presentations. Moreover,
he saw that <I>Sachverhalte</I> can serve as correlates not only of acts
of judging but also of special kinds of nominal acts (for example when
we say <I>that S is p</I> 'is welcome', 'is probable', 'has as consequence
that ...', etc.).<SUP><A HREF="#N_36_">(36)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In the second volume of the <I>Logical
Investigations</I>, Husserl distinguishes further between the immanent
content of a judging act and the <I>Sachverhalt</I> as transcendent target.<SUP><A HREF="#N_37_">(37)</A></SUP>
On the side of the act itself he distinguishes not only the immanent <I>content</I>
but also what he calls the <I>quality</I> of the act - what makes it an
act of <I>judgment, doubt, assumption</I>, etc. - a moment of the act which
may vary even though its immanent content remains fixed.<SUP><A HREF="#N_38_">(38)</A></SUP>
This immanent content, now, is understood not in terms of 'images' or 'pictures'
but rather as a more basic sort of component of the act in virtue of which
the latter is experienced by the subject as directed to an object or state

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Husserl now goes further still. He utilises
the Aristotelian idea of a universal species becoming instantiated in its
individual instances as a means of drawing a distinction between this immanent
content of an act on the one hand and what he calls its 'ideal content'
on the other. This ideal content is the immanent content taken <I>in specie</I>
(as the objects treated by the geometer are the ideal species of the lines
and shapes given in reality). And where an immanent content can be brought
to expression linguistically, then the corresponding ideal content is called
by Husserl the <I>meaning</I> of the given expression.<SUP><A HREF="#N_40_">(40)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Husserl's theory of linguistic meaning
and of the structures of meanings is thus part and parcel of his theory
of acts and of the structures of acts, and his handling of the relations
between language, act and meaning manifests a sophistication of a sort
previously unknown among the Brentanists. Broadly speaking, we can say
that the orthodox Brentanians had insufficient appreciation of the dimension
of <I>logical syntax</I> - a price they paid, in part, for their radical
rejection of the combinatorial aspects of the old 'combination theory'
of judgment and truth. Thus they lacked any recognition of the fact that
acts of judgment are distinguished from acts of presentation not only by
the presence of a moment of assertion or belief, but also - on the level
of what we might call 'mental grammar' - by a special ('propositional')
<I>form</I>.
A judgment must, in other words, have a certain special sort of inner complexity,
which expresses itself linguistically in the form of the sentence and is
reflected ontologically in the form of the <I>Sachverhalt</I>. The expression
of a judgment must for example admit of tense and aspect modifications
and also of modification by logical operators such as negation, conjunction,
etc., as well as by operators such as 'it is the case that', 'it is possible
that', 'it is necessary that', 'I think that', and so on.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Certainly Frege is responsible for some
of the most important advances in our understanding of logico-grammatical
form. It is ironical, however, that in his conception of sentences as special
sorts of names, Frege is, as far as his treatment of the logico-grammatical
peculiarities of judgment and sentence is concerned, no further advanced
than was Brentano. Here, again, one has to look to Bolzano in order to
find truly coherent anticipations of the idea of propositional form.<SUP><A HREF="#N_41_">(41)</A></SUP>
But the idea of a science of 'logical grammar', of a formal theory of the
categories of linguistic units (and of their mental counterparts) and of
the categorial laws governing the combination of such units, was first
conceived by Husserl in his IVth Logical Investigation. This work influenced
in turn the development of the theory of grammatical categories by Leniewski
and his successors in Poland.<SUP><A HREF="#N_42_">(42)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Husserl's theory has built into its very
foundations the idea of a parallelism of structure between (1) immanent
contents on the level of our empirically executed acts and (2) ideal contents
on the level of logic. He is thereby able to account in a very natural
way for the fact that the laws of logic apply to actual thinkings, speakings
and inferrings, while at the same time doing justice to the necessity which
accrues to such laws by virtue of the fact that they relate primarily to
certain ideal or universal species and only secondarily to the immanent
contents by which these species may come to be instantiated. Frege and
his successors in the analytic tradition, in contrast, because they turned
aside from questions of what Brentano and Husserl called 'descriptive psychology',
thereby left themselves in a position where they were unable to do justice
to the relations between ideal contents and the cognitive activities through
which these become actualised or instantiated. The applicability of logic
to empirical thinkings and inferrings is thus rendered in their work all
but inexplicable - an outcome which further reinforced the initial aversion
to psychology on the part of philosophers of the analytic sort, and thereby
also lent encouragement to those mathematical logicians who have wanted
to conceive propositions as little more than nodes of abstract formal theories.
Brentano, on the other hand, and the more orthodox Brentanians, tended
to the opposite, psychological extreme: because they feared the 'Platonism'
of ideal contents, their treatment of logic was less than successful, and
therefore so also was their treatment of the specifically logical properties
of our judging acts.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Husserl goes beyond his Brentanist predecessors
also in his treatment of ontology. Setting out from Meinong's idea of a
'theory of objects', Husserl initiates a new discipline of 'formal ontology',
within which the formal concept of <I>Sachverhalt</I> - 'formal' because
it can be applied to all matters without restriction - comes to be ranked
alongside the formal concept of <I>object</I>. It is more than anything
else this Husserlian discipline of formal ontology, as developed by Husserl's
disciples in Munich, which led to Reinach's conception of logic as a science
of states of affairs.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>7. Logic and the </B><I>Sachverhalt</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Simplifying somewhat, we can conceive
Husserl's <I>Sachverhalt</I> as the creature of a naturalistic ontology:
the <I>Sachverhalt</I> is a truth-making segment of reality that is 'thrown
into relief' through an act of judgment.<SUP><A HREF="#N_43_">(43)</A></SUP>
Thus the Husserlian <I>Sachverhalt</I> is dependent upon consciousness
for its demarcation, but it is independent in the sense that what gets
demarcated - we might call it the matter of the <I>Sachverhalt</I> - exists
independently of the act which brings this demarcation about. Only in the
rarest of cases - where the matter is per accidens of a purely psychic
sort - is the <I>Sachverhalt</I> a creature immanent to the mind in the
sense of Stumpf. Certainly there are Platonistic elements in Husserl's
logic and ontology, but these relate not to <I>Sachverhalte</I>, but to
propositions, i.e. to the ideal species of the contents of sentence-using
acts. Reinach, in contrast, defends a Platonistic ontology of <I>Sachverhalte</I>.
In this he is inspired in part by Meinong and Bolzano, and in part also
by Marty who had defended a view of <I>Sachverhalte</I> or 'judgment-contents'
as 'that which grounds objectively the correctness of our judging'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_44_">(44)</A></SUP>
He goes further than all three, however, in embracing a clear distinction
between propositional <I>meanings</I> on the onehand and <I>Sachverhalte</I>
on the other. The totality of <I>Sachverhalte</I> Reinach conceives as
an eternal realm comprehending the correlates of all possible judgments,
whether positive or negative, true or false, necessary or contingent, atomic
or complex. Objects, it is true, may come and go, but <I>Sachverhalte</I>
are immutable (a view which is of course almost exactly the reverse of
that embraced by Wittgenstein in the <I>Tractatus</I>). Reinach is in this
way in a position to conceive <I>Sachverhalte</I> as the locus of existence
of the past and of the future, that is, as truth-makers for our present
judgings about objects which have ceased to exist or have yet to come into
existence. He is by this means able also to guarantee the timelessness
of truth and falsehood.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Perhaps we can understand the motives which
led Reinach to this somewhat peculiar view of logic and the <I>Sachverhalt</I>
if we reflect on the fact that, the subject matter of logic having once
been expelled from the psyche, it became quite generally necessary for
logicians to provide some alternative account of what this subject matter
ought to be. Frege himself, along with Bolzano and Husserl, had looked
to ideal meanings, but ideal meanings have something mythological about
them and they bring with them the problem of how they can be 'grasped'
by mortal thinking subjects. As we know, many philosophers in the tradition
of Frege looked in this connection to sentences, and to the 'institution
of a common language', as an alternative to the Platonism of ideal meanings,
though it is not clear why, given the diversity and changeability of human
languages, this appeal does not face objections parallel to those which
earlier confronted psychologism. Reinach, in contrast, looked neither to
ideal meanings nor to their expressions in language, but (as he saw it)
out into the world, to the objectual correlates of judging acts. Many entities
of this sort are, he insisted, unproblematically accessible, for example
in perfectly ordinary acts of <I>seeing that</I>. A <I>Sachverhalt</I>-based
foundation of logic can however serve as an alternative to psychologism
only if it can guarantee the objectivity and necessity of logical laws.
It was to this end that Reinach saw himself as being forced to conceive
his <I>Sachverhalte</I> in a Platonistic (and therefore non-naturalistic)
way, i.e. to grant them a special status of the sort that was granted to
propositions by Bolzano, Frege and Husserl.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Platonism, here, means that <I>Sachverhalte</I>
are transcendent not only to the mind but also to the world of spatio-temporal
objects. It means that they are entirely independent of all mental activities;
that they are such as to play no role in causal relations; and that they
exist outside of time and space. In all of these respects Reinachian <I>Sachverhalte</I>
resemble sets as standardly conceived. Like sets, <I>Sachverhalte</I> are
built up (<I>inter alia</I>) out of ordinary objects in a way that somehow
suspends the mutability of the latter.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The realm of <I>Sachverhalte</I> is, according
to Reinach, complete, in the sense that there is a <I>Sachverhalt</I> precisely
coordinated to every possible judgment. One reason for accepting a completeness
of this sort on Reinach's part is that it allows him to uphold the correspondence
theory of truth in its full generality. It allows for each variety of judgment
an appropriate variety of truth-making states of affairs. This applies,
in particular, to negative judgments, which are correlated with negative
states of affairs. And while it may be possible to conceive a positive
state of affairs like <I>this rose is red</I> as some sort of real complex
(of the rose and its redness), no such view is possible for negative states
of affairs like <I>this rose is not yellow</I> or <I>unicorns do not exist</I>,
which cannot be counted as denizens of reality in any sense. The thesis
of completeness in this way lends additional support to the remaining Platonistic
elements of the Reinachian ontology.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Wittgenstein's <I>Tractatus</I>, of course,
contains a <I>Sachverhalt</I>-based correspondence theory of truth which
dispenses with Reinachian Platonism and is at least in this respect more
convincing. What Wittgenstein lacks, however, is an ontology of <I>Sachverhalte</I>
of the sort that would allow him also to provide an account of the ways
in which such entities are related to our everyday thinkings and other
cognitive activities (for example to those acts of seeing that in which
our judgments get verified). Reinach, in contrast, because his <I>Sachverhalte</I>
may involve ordinary objects of experience, is able to show how our mental
acts and states may relate, in different ways, to <I>Sachverhalte</I> as
their objects, and how they may therefore stand in relations parallel to
the logical relations which obtain (according to Reinach) among these <I>Sachverhalte</I>
themselves. One of Reinach's most original contributions is in fact his
account of the different sorts of acts in which <I>Sachverhalte</I> are
grasped and of the various kinds of attitudes which have <I>Sachverhalte</I>
as their objects, and of how such acts and attitudes relate to each other
and to the acts and attitudes which have judgments and propositions as
their objects.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">8. Real Semantics</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It has become a commonplace that Bolzano,
Frege and Husserl, by banishing thoughts from the mind, created the preconditions
for the development of logic in the modern sense. By defending a view of
thoughts or propositions as ideal or abstract entities, they made possible
a conception of propositions as entities capable of being manipulated in
different ways in formal theories. Just as Cantor had shown mathematicians
of an earlier generation how to manipulate sets or classes conceived in
abstraction from their members and from the manner of their generation,
so logicians were able to become accustomed, by degrees, to manipulating
propositional objects in abstraction from their contents and from their
psychological roots in acts of judgment.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now, however, we can see that the achievements
of Bolzano, Frege and Husserl were part and parcel of a larger historical
process, in which Lotze and Bergmann, but also Brentano, Stumpf, Marty,
Meinong and above all Twardowski and his students in Poland, played a crucial
role. We can see also that, as was clear to the author of the <I>Tractatus</I>,
the squeezing apart of the two notions of proposition and <I>Sachverhalt</I>
was no less important an achievement in the overcoming of psychologism
than was the separation of judgment both from complex concepts on the one
hand and from ideal propositions on the other.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">It is noteworthy in this light that Tarski's
1935 essay on the concept of truth, the single most important work arising
out of the Lemberg-Warsaw school founded by Twardowski and his students,
rests precisely on a discovery of how it is possible to manipulate formally
not only sentences or propositions but also certain special sorts of object-structures
in the world to which these sentences or propositions correspond. Tarski
attempts, we might say, to capture mathematically the highest common factor
running through the family of correspondence-theoretic views of truth,
a factor which can be expressed in the form of a thesis to the effect that</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">a true sentence is one which says
that things are so and so, and things are so and so.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This thesis derives in the end from Aristotle.
But it is taken by Tarski from his teacher Kotarbiski, who had derived
it in turn from Twardowski's work on the <I>Sachverhalt</I> and on the
so-called 'absolute' theory of truth.<SUP><A HREF="#N_45_">(45)</A></SUP></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Logical or 'model-theoretic' semantics
since 1935 has departed considerably from those aspects of Tarski's work
which reflected his original concern to find formal means of manipulating
<I>ways
things stand</I> in parallel to sentences or propositions. Model theorists
have sought instead to exploit the mathematical resources which Tarski
and others put at their disposal, and this has meant that their work has
been confined to the construction and manipulation of abstract set-theoretic
structures that have little or no relation to the actual world of what
happens and is the case. Logic itself has hereby to a regrettable extent
come to be freed of its relation to truth as classically conceived. More
recent work, above all on the part of the situation semanticists, seems
however to be pointing once more in the direction of a semantics that would
be compatible with a <I>Sachverhalt</I> ontology of a more realistic sort,
and to this extent there may perhaps be life yet in a conception of logic
along Reinachian lines. Both Reinach and the situation semanticists suggest
that we should shake ourselves free from the one-sided textbook conception
of logic as a science of <I>propositions</I> conceived in abstraction from
their realisations in the minds of thinking subjects and from their objectual
correlates in the world. Logic should be seen, rather, not as a science
of other-worldly 'bearers of truth', but as a discipline engaging whatever
it is that can stand in <I>truth-relations</I>. And when matters are conceived
in this light, then the temptation to embrace a special realm of propositions
is much more easily resisted.</FONT>
