<blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Abstract. </b>This paper is concerned with certain ontological
issues in the foundations of geographic representation. It sets out what
these basic issues are, describes the tools needed to deal with them, and
draws some implications for a general theory of spatial representation.
Our approach has ramifications in the domains of mereology, topology, and
the theory of location, and the question of the interaction of these three
domains within a unified spatial representation theory is addressed. In
the final part we also consider the idea of non-standard geographies, which
may be associated with geography under a classical conception in the same
sense in which non-standard logics are associated with classical logic.
