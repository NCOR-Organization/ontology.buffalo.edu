<blockquote>
<blockquote>Ontology, since Aristotle, has been conceived as a sort of
highly general physics, a science of the types of entities in reality,
of the objects, properties, categories and relations which make up the
world. At the same time ontology has been for some two thousand years a
speculative enterprise. It has rested methodologically on introspection
and on the construction and analysis of elaborate world-models and of abstract
formal-ontological theories. In the work of Quine and others this ontological
theorizing in abstract fashion about the world was supplemented by the
study, based on the use of logical methods, of the ontological commitments
or presuppositions embodied in scientific theories. In recent years both
types of ontological study have found application in the world of information
systems, for example in the construction of frameworks for knowledge representation
and in database design and translation. As ontology is in this way drawn
closer to the domain of real-world applications, the question arises as
to whether it is possible to use empirical methods in studying ontological
theories. More specifically: can we use empirical methods to test the ontological
theories embodied in human cognition? In what follows we set forth the
outlines of a framework for the formulation and testing of such theories
as they relate to the specific domain of geographic objects and categories.
