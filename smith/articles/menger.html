to vol. 22 (1990), 263-288.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><B><I>1. Preamble</I></B>
<P>There are, familiarly, a range of distinct and competing accounts of
the methodological underpinnings of Menger's work. These include Leibnizian,
Kantian, Millian, and even Popperian readings; but they include also readings
of an Aristotelian sort, and I have myself made a number of contributions
in clarification and defence of the latter.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>
Not only, I have argued, does the historical situation in which Menger
found himself point to the inevitability of the Aristotelian reading;<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>
this reading fits also very naturally to the text of Menger's works.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP>
<P>The diversity of interpretations is not, however, entirely surprising.
It is on the one hand a consequence of the fact that Menger breaks new
ground in economic theory in part by fashioning new linguistic instruments
not yet readily capable of unambiguous interpretation. It reflects further
a lack of knowledge on the part of historians of economic thought of the
most recent scholarship on 19th and 20th century Austrian philosophy and
on the role of Aristotelianism therein.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP>
Still more importantly, perhaps, it reflects the fact that Aristotelian
ways of thinking were for so long alien to the modern philosophical and
scientific mind. For non-Aristotelian readings were advanced above all
by those who would be charitable to Menger by stripping his ideas of what
was held to be an unfashionable residue of metaphysics.<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP>
<P>There is one further reason for the diversity of interpretation, however,
which reflects a recurring problem faced by those of us who work in the
history of ideas in general and in the history of Austrian ideas in particular.
This is the problem of how much credence one ought to award to self-interpretations
when seeking an assessment of the nature and significance of a given thinker's
achievements. For self-interpretations are very often flawed as a result
of the fact that their authors naturally give prominence to the detailed
<I>differences</I> between their own ideas and the ideas of those around
them; they pay attention, in other words, to what is original, quirky or
odd. That which they take for granted, and which they have imbibed from
their surrounding culture, is hereby no less naturally, and inevitably
ignored. Now as anyone who has worked through the writings of Menger's
Austrian philosophical contemporaries very soon becomes aware, the tacit
intellectual background of educated Austrians in Menger's day and beyond
was Aristotelian through and through to such an extent that Menger himself
might have felt the need to draw attention to this background only when
attempting to explain his ideas to those, such as Walras, or his own son
Karl Jr., who did not share it. Menger is otherwise relatively silent as
far as methodological self-interpretation is concerned, at least in the
sense that he does not ally himself explicitly for example with the Aristotelian
camp.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP> Problems arise, however, when we
consider the writings of those of Menger's Austrian contemporaries and
successors including Mises, Hayek, as well as Karl Jr. who have sought
self-interpretations of Menger at one remove. Such Austrian Austrians are,
I want to suggest, least likely to enjoy a conscious awareness of the essence
of Austrian economic thinking. Their interpretations of Menger will tend
to pick out what is quirky, or especially modern, in Menger at the expense
of the shared and therefore for practical purposes invisible background
that holds his work together. And this background is, as cannot be too
often stress, Aristotelian even if only in the watered-down sense that
is still to be more precisely specified. Indeed the Aristotelian background
permeated Austrian thought to such an extent that even the newly burgeoning
empiricism of the Austrian positivist movement was crucially coloured by
it.<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>2. The Basic Doctrine</I></B>
<P>Those who have seen fit to advance an Aristotelian reading have of course
themselves often left much to be desired in the way of precision and detail.
Here, therefore, I shall do my best to set out the precise form of the
Aristotelian doctrine that is relevant to the thinking of Menger and his
Austrian contemporaries. I shall then go on to demonstrate how the Menger-Mises
relation and the general issue of apriorism in economics might profitably
be re-examined in its light.
<P>I shall confine myself hereby to general philosophy: the ways in which
Aristotle's ethics and politics filtered through into the thinking of the
Austrians will not be of concern.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP> As
will become clear, it is a highly refined and purified and indeed simplified
version of Aristotle's general philosophy that is at issue when we are
dealing with 19th and early 20th century Austrian thought. It is an Aristotelianism
shorn of all reference to, say, a passive or active intellect or to queer
mechanisms for coming to know the world via a `making actual' within the
soul of essences existing only `potentially' within things. Only as a result
of more recent work on Austrian and German philosophy in general, and on
the Brentano school and on the early phenomenologists in particular, has
clarity as concerns the nature of Austrian Aristotelianism become possible.
And this allows also a move beyond such earlier defences of an Aristotelian
interpretation of Menger's work as were advanced for example by Kauder
and Hutchinson, which based themselves on little more than superficial
analogies.
<P>What then is the basic doctrine of Austrian Aristotelianism that is
shared, above all, by Menger, Brentano and their immediate followers? If,
at the risk of a certain degree of painful obviousness, we attempt an assay
of the common axis running through a number of otherwise disparate modes
of thinking, then the basic doctrine might be said to embrace the following
theses:
<P><B>1. The world exists, independently of our thinking and reasoning
activities.</B> This world embraces both material and mental aspects (and
perhaps other <I>sui generis</I> dimensions, for example of law and culture).
And while we might shape the world and contribute to it through our thoughts
and actions, detached and objective theorizing about the world in all its
aspects is nonetheless possible.
<P><B>2. There are in the world certain simple `essences' or `natures'
or `elements', as well as laws, structures or connections governing these,
all of which are <I>strictly universal</I>,</B> both in that they do not
change historically and in the sense that they are capable of being instantiated,
in principle (which is to say: if the appropriate conditions are satisfied),
at all times and in all cultures. The fact that the simple essences and
essential structures do not themselves change or develop implies in addition
that historical change is a matter, not of changes in the basic building
blocks of reality, but of changes in the patterns of their exemplification
and in the ways in which they come together to form more complex wholes.
<P>Propositions expressing universal connections amongst essences are called
by Menger `exact laws'. Such laws may be either static or dynamic they
may concern either the co-existence or the succession of instances of the
corresponding simple essences or natures. It is exact laws, as Menger sees
it, which constitute a scientific theory in the strict sense. The general
laws of essence of which such a theory would consist are subject to no
exceptions. In this respect they are comparable, say, to the laws of geometry
or mechanics, and contrasted with mere statements of fact and with inductive
hypotheses. The aim of the `exact orientation of research' is, as Menger
puts it,
<BLOCKQUOTE>the determination of strict laws of the phenomena, of regularities
in the succession of phenomena which not only present themselves as exceptionless,
but which, when we take account of the ways in which we have come to know
them, in fact bear within themselves the guarantee of their own exceptionlessness
(1883, p. 38, Eng. p. 59, translation corrected)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3. Our experience of this world involves in every case both an individual
and a general aspect.</B> As in Aristotle himself, so also in Menger and
in the work of other Aristotelians such as Brentano and Reinach, a radical
empiricism hereby goes hand in hand with essentialism. The general aspect
of experience is conceived by the Aristotelian as something entirely ordinary
and matter-of-fact. Thus it is not the work of any separate or special
faculty of `intuition' but is rather involved of necessity in every act
of perceiving and thinking a fact which makes itself felt in the ubiquitous
employment of general terms in all natural languages. Thus the general
aspect of experience is as direct and straightforward as is our capacity
to distinguish reds from greens, circles from squares, or warnings from
congratulatings.
<P>For Menger, as for Aristotle, what is general does not exist in isolation
from what is individual. Menger is, like other Aristotelians, an immanent
realist.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP> He is interested in the essences
and laws manifested in <I>this</I> world, not in any separate realm of
incorporeal Ideal Forms such as is embraced by philosophers of a Platonistic
sort. As Brentano formulates the matter in his study of Aristotle's psychology:
<BLOCKQUOTE>the scientist wants to get to know the crystals and plants
and other bodies that he finds here on earth; if therefore he were to grasp
the concepts of tetrahedra and octahedra, of trees and grasses, which belong
to another world, then he would clearly in no way achieve his goal. (1867,
p. 135, Eng. p. 88)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Things are no different even in the case of mathematical knowledge:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The individual straight line which is in the senses, and the
being of this line which the intellect grasps, are essentially identical.
One is therefore not allowed to suppose that the intellect should grasp
something more immaterial than sense, that it should take into itself something
incorporeal or at least something non-sensory. No: the very same thing
which is in the intellect is also in the senses, but related to other things
in different ways. (<I>op. cit.</I>)</BLOCKQUOTE>
As Menger puts it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>the goal of research in the field of theoretical economics
can only be the determination of the general essence and the general connection
of economic <I>phenomena</I>. (Menger 1883, p. 7, n. 4, Eng. p. 37)</BLOCKQUOTE>
The theoretical scientist, then, has to learn to recognize the general
recurring structures in the flux of reality. And theoretical understanding
of a concrete phenomenon cannot be achieved via any mere inductive enumeration
of cases. It is attained, rather, only by apprehending the phenomenon in
question as
<BLOCKQUOTE>a special case of a certain regularity (conformity to law)
in the succession, or in the coexistence of phenomena. In other words,
we become aware of the basis of the existence and the peculiarity of the
essence of a concrete phenomenon by learning to recognize in it merely
the exemplification of a conformity-to-law of phenomena in general. (Menger
1883, p. 17, Eng. pp. 44f.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>4. The general aspect of experience need be in no sense infallible (it
reflects no special source of special knowledge), and may indeed be subject
to just the same sorts of errors as is our knowledge of what is individual.
</B>Indeed, great difficulties may be set in the way of our attaining knowledge
of essential structures of certain sorts, and of our transforming such
knowledge into the organized form of a strict theory. Above all we may
(as Hume showed) mistakenly suppose that we have grasped a law or structure
for psychological reasons of habit. Our knowledge of structures or laws
can nevertheless be exact. For the quality of exactness or strict universality
is skew to that of infallibility. <I>Episteme</I> may be ruled out in certain
circumstances, but true <I>doxa</I> (which is to say, `orthodoxy') may
be nonetheless available.
<P><B>5. We can know, albeit under the conditions set out in 4., what the
world is like, at least in its broad outlines, both via common sense and
via scientific method. </B>Thus Aristotelianism embraces not only commonsense
realism but also scientific realism, though Aristotle himself ran these
two positions together in ways no longer possible today.<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP>
The commonsense realism of Menger (as of all Austrian economists) is seen
in his treatment of <I>agents</I>,
<I>actions</I>, <I>beliefs</I>, <I>desires</I>,
etc. In regard to these sorts of entity there is no opposition between
reality as it appears to common sense and reality as revealed to scientific
theory. Menger's (or the Austrian economists') scientific realism, on the
other hand, is revealed in the treatment of phenomena such as spontaneous
orders and invisible hand processes, where common sense diverges from the
fine structures disclosed by theory.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP>
<P>Taken together with 3., this aspect of the Aristotelian doctrine implies
that we can know what the world is like both in its individual and in its
general aspect, and our knowledge will likely manifest a progressive improvement,
both in depth of penetration and in adequacy to the structures penetrated.
Indeed Menger points at the very beginning of the <I>Principles</I> to
a correlation between `the higher culture of a people' and the extent to
which `human beings penetrate more deeply into the true essence of things
and of their own nature' (1871, p. 4, Eng. p. 53).
<P><B>6. We can know what this world is like, at least in principle, from
the detached perspective of an ideal scientific observer. </B>Thus in the
social sciences in particular there is no suggestion that only those who
are in some sense part of a given culture or form of life can grasp this
culture or form of life theoretically. The general structures of reality
are not merely capable of being exemplified, in principle, in different
times and cultures; like the basic laws of geometry or logic they also
enjoy an intrinsic intelligibility which makes them capable of being grasped,
again in principle and with differing degrees of difficulty, by knowing
subjects of widely differing sorts and from widely differing backgrounds.
Indeed, because the essences and essential structures are intelligible,
the corresponding laws are capable of being grasped by the scientific theorist
in principle on the basis of a single instance.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP>
<P><B>7. The simple essences or natures pertaining to the various different
segments or levels of reality constitute an alphabet of structural parts</B>.
These can be combined together in different ways, both statically and dynamically
(according to co-existence and according to order of succession). Theoretical
research, for Menger,
<BLOCKQUOTE>seeks to ascertain the <I>simplest elements</I> of everything
real, elements which must be thought of as strictly typical just because
they are the simplest. (1883, p. 41, Eng. p. 60)</BLOCKQUOTE>
The theorist must therefore learn to penetrate through the dross of ephemeral
detail. He must seek to determine the elements
<BLOCKQUOTE>without considering whether they are present in reality as
<I>independent</I> phenomena; indeed, even without considering whether
they can at all be presented in their full purity. In this manner theoretical
research arrives at <I>qualitatively</I> strictly typical forms of the
phenomena (<I>loc. cit.</I>)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Scientific theory results, then, at least in part, when means are found
for mapping or picturing the composition of such simple and prototypical
constituents into larger wholes. Thus the theoretical science of psychology,
for Brentano,
<BLOCKQUOTE>seeks to display all the ultimate psychic components from whose
combination one with another the totality of psychic phenomena would result,
just as the totality of words is yielded by the letters of the alphabet
(quoted in Brentano 1982, pp. x-xi).</BLOCKQUOTE>
Such `combination' or `composition' is not simply a matter of heaping or
gluing together. It is a matter of certain entities or features or properties
of entities arising in reflection of the existence of special sorts of
combinations of other sorts of entities. Thus for example a <I>good</I>
exists as such only if the following prerequisites are simultaneously present:
<P>1. A need on the part of some human being.
<P>2. Properties of the object in question which render it capable of being
brought into a causal connection with the satisfaction of this need.
<P>3. Knowledge of this causal connection on the part of the person involved.
<P>4. Command of the thing sufficient to direct it to the satisfaction
of the need.<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP>
<P>If a good exists, then as a matter of <I>de re</I> necessity, entities
of these other sorts exist also. I shall return in the sequel to the treatment
of such simple structures of <I>de re</I> necessitation. It is these structures,
I want to claim, which lie at the core not only of Menger's work but of
the entire tradition of Austrian economics.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>3. Aristotelianism vs. Accidentalist Atomism</I></B>
<P>Many of the above theses are of course thin beer, and might seem trivially
acceptable. Taken together, however, they do have a certain metaphysical
cutting power. It is thesis 5., above all, which establishes the line between
the Aristotelian doctrine and that of Kant (for whom there looms behind
the world we know an inaccessible world of `things in themselves'). Theses
1. and 5. mark off Austrian Aristotelianism from all idealist doctrines
of the sort which embrace the view that the world of experience or of scientific
inquiry is somehow created or constituted by the individual subject or
by the linguistic community or scientific theory, or what one will. Theses
2. and 6. distinguish the doctrine from all sorts of historicism, as also
from hermeneuticist relativism and other modern fancies. And theses 2.
and 5. tell us that, for the Aristotelian, scientific or theoretical knowledge
is possible even of the structures or essences of the social world, a view
shared in common by both Menger and Brentano, and denied (in different
ways) by historicists and relativists of differing hues.
<P>Most importantly, however, the doctrine is distinguished via theses
3. and 5. from the positivistic, empiricistic methodology which has been
dominant in philosophical circles for the bulk of the present century and
which enjoys a position as the unquestioned background of almost all theorizing
amongst scientists themselves. Positivism has its roots in atomism, the
view that all that exists is atoms associated together in accidental and
unintelligible ways and that all intelligible structures and all necessities
are merely the result of thought-constructions introduced by man. The origins
of the struggle between atomists and Aristotelians in ancient Greek thought
are well-summarized by Meikle:
<BLOCKQUOTE>On the one hand there were Democritus and Epicurus, who thought
of reality as atomistic small-bits that combine and repel in the void,
and who had a hard job accounting for the persisting natures of things,
species and genera on that basis. On the other hand there was Aristotle,
who realised that no account of such things could be possible without admitting
a category of form (or essence), because what a thing is, and what things
of its kind are, cannot possibly be explained in terms of their constituent
matter (atoms), since that changes while the entity retains its nature
and identity over time. (1985, p. 9)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Where the atomist sees only one sort of structure <I>in re</I>, the structure
of accidental association, the Aristotelian sees in addition intelligible
or law-governed structures that he can understand. Where the atomist sees
only one sort of change, accidental change (for example of the sort which
occurs when a horse is run over by a truck), the Aristotelian sees in addition
intelligible or law-governed changes, as, for example, when a foal grows
up into a horse. Just as for the Aristotelian the intelligibility of structure
can imply that there are certain sorts of structure which are intelligibly
impossible, for example a society made up of inanimate objects, so for
the Aristotelian there are intelligibly impossible <I>changes</I>, for
example of a horse into a truck, or of a stone into a colour. The presence
of intelligible changes implies, moreover, that there is no `problem of
induction' for a thinker of the Aristotelian sort. When we understand a
phenomenon as the instance of a given species, then this understanding
relates also to the characteristic patterns of growth and evolution of
the phenomen and to its characteristic modes of interaction with other
phenomena.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>4. The Special Doctrine (Forms of Aristotelianism in the Social
Sciences)</I></B>
<P>We have not yet gone far enough, however, in picking out the essence
of the doctrine of Austrian Aristotelianism. For Aristotelianism played
a crucial role also in the philosophy of German social thinkers such as
Marx,<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP> and many other German political
economists and legal theorists of the 19th and even of the 20th centuries
could have accepted at least the bulk of what has been presented above.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP>
The opposition between German and Austrian modes of thinking should not,
in this respect, be exaggerated. Thus Brentano, normally and correctly
regarded as the Austrian philosopher (and as the philosophical representative
of Austrian Aristotelianism) <I>par excellence</I>, was in fact born in
Germany. Moreover, his Aristotelianism was decisively influenced by the
thinking of the great German metaphysician F. A. Trendelenburg. Equally,
however, it would be wrong to ignore the crucial differences, above all
as between Marx's methodology on the one hand and the basic doctrine of
Austrian Aristotelianism on the other. Thus Menger's doctrine of the strict
universality of laws is denied by Marx, for whom laws are in every case
specific to `a given social organism'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP>
Moreover, while Marx and Menger share an Aristotelian antipathy to atomism,
the holism or collectivism propounded by Marx is in this respect radically
more extreme than anything that could have been countenanced by Menger.
<P>Hegel, too, is correctly described as an Aristotelian in many aspects
of his thinking. His case is somewhat different from that of Marx, however,
since it seems that he denied thesis 1. More precisely, Hegel failed to
draw the clear line between act and object of cognition which 1. requires,
and he refused to acknowledge any sort of independence of the latter from
the former. As he himself writes (in dealing with Aristotle): `thought
thinks itself by participation in that which is thought, but thought becomes
thought by contact and apprehension, so that <I>thought and the object
of thought are the same</I>.'<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP> Or as
Allen Wood expresses it: `Marx parts company with Hegel precisely because
Hegel makes the dialectical nature of thought the basis for the dialectical
structure of reality, where Marx holds that just the reverse is the case.'
(1981, p. 215)
<P>To specify, therefore, the exact nature of the Austrian Aristotelian
view, it will be useful to add to our basic doctrine a number of additional
theses specific to the domain of social science which are formulated in
such a way as to bring out as clearly as possible the opposition between
the Austrian view and views shared by the principal German social theorists
who had been influenced by Aristotelian ideas:
<P><B>8. The theory of value is to be built up exclusively on `subjective'
foundations, which is to say exclusively on the basis of the corresponding
mental acts and states of human subjects.</B> Thus value for Menger in
stark contrast to Marx is to be accounted for exclusively in terms of the
satisfaction of human needs and wants. Economic value, in particular, is
seen as being derivative of the valuing acts of ultimate consumers, and
Menger's thinking might most adequately be encapsulated as the attempt
to defend the possibility of an economics which would be at one and the
same time both theoretical and subjectivist in the given sense. Among the
different representatives of the philosophical school of value theory in
Austria (Brentano, Meinong, Ehrenfels, etc.) subjectivism as here defined
takes different forms.<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP> All of them
share with Menger however the view that value exists only in the nexus
of human valuing acts.
<P><B>9. There are no `social wholes' or `social organisms'. </B>Austrian
Aristotelians hereby and leaving aside the rather special case of Wieser
embrace a doctrine of <I>ontological</I> individualism, which implies also
a concomitant <I>methodological</I> individualism, according to which all
talk of nations, classes, firms, etc., is to be treated by the social theorist
as an in principle eliminable shorthand for talk of individuals. That it
is not entirely inappropriate to conceive individualism in either sense
as `Aristotelian' is seen for example in Aristotle's own treatment of knowledge
and science in terms of the mental acts, states and powers or capacities
of individual human subjects.<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP>
<P>Economics is methodologically individualist when its laws are seen as
being made true in their entirety by patterns of mental acts and actions
of individual subjects, so that all economic phenomena are capable of being
understood by the theorist as the results or outcomes of combinations and
interactions of the thoughts and actions of individuals. Such combinations
and interactions are not mere `sums'. Thus neither ontological nor methodological
individualism need imply any sort of atomistic reductionism: the individual
of which the social theorist treats is, as a result of different sorts
of interaction with other individuals, a highly complex entity. He might
more properly be conceived as something like a node in the various spontaneous
orders in which he is involved. This is a familiar idea, which extends
back at least as far as Aristotle.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP>
As the Hungarian philosopher Aurel Kolnai puts it in his defence of `conservative
libertarianism' published in 1981:
<BLOCKQUOTE>society is not only composed of various parts it is composed
of various parts in a multiplicity of ways; and consequently its component
parts cannot but <I>overlap</I>. In other words, it consists ultimately
of individuals, but only in the sense that it divides into a multiplicity
of individuals across several social subdivisions, such that it comprehends
the same individual over and over again in line with his various social
affiliations (p. 319).</BLOCKQUOTE>
Every individual therefore `embodies a multiplicity of social aspects or
categories', and these play a crucial role in determining which sorts of
essential structures the individual might exemplify.
<P><B>10. There are no (graspable) laws of historical development.</B>
Where Marx, in true Aristotelian spirit, sought to establish the `laws
of the phenomena', he awarded principal importance to the task of establishing
<I>laws of development</I>, which is to say, laws governing the transition
from one `form' or `stage' of society to another. He `treats the social
movement as a process of natural history governed by laws',<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21)</A></SUP>
and he sees the social theorist as having the capacity to grasp such laws
and therefore also in principle to sanction large-scale interferences in
the social `organism'. Marx himself thereby accepted both methodological
and ontological collectivism; he saw social science as issuing in highly
macroscopic laws, for example to the effect that history must pass through
certain well-defined `stages'. The Aristotelianism of the Austrians is
in this respect more modest: it sees the exact method as being restricted
to certain simple essences and essential connections only, in ways which
set severe limits on the capacity of theoretical social science to make
predictions. The methodological individualism of the Austrians has indeed
been criticized by Marxists as a branch of atomism, though such criticisms
assume too readily that methodological individualism trades in `sums'.
<P>What, now, of the German historical economists? As already noted, Aristotelian
doctrines played a role also in German economic science, not least as a
result of the influence of Hegel. Thus for example Roscher not only accepted
many of the tenets of the basic Aristotelian doctrine listed above, he
also developed, as Streissler has shown, a subjective theory of value along
lines very similar to those later taken up by Menger.<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP>
Such subjectivism was accepted also by Knies. Moreover, Knies and Schmoller
agreed with the Austrians in denying the existence of laws of historical
development. In all of these respects, therefore, the gulf between Menger
and the German historicists is much less than has normally been suggested.
The German historicists are still crucially distinguished from the Austrians,
however, in remaining wedded to a purely inductivistic methodology, regarding
history as providing a basis of fact from out of which laws of economic
science could be extracted. For an Aristotelian such as Menger, in contrast
(cf. thesis 3. above), enumerative induction can never yield that sort
of knowledge of exact law which constitutes a scientific theory.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>5. Apriorism</I></B>
<P>Austrian Aristotelianism as formulated above is first and foremost a
doctrine of ontology: it tells us what the world is like and what its objects,
states and processes are like, including those capacities, states and processes
we call knowledge and science. More generally, it tells us what sorts of
relations obtain between the various different segments of reality. The
question of apriorism, on the other hand, which is skew to all such ontological
concerns even to concerns pertaining to the ontology of knowledge relates
exclusively to the sort of account one gives of the conditions under which
knowledge is <I>acquired</I>.
<P>Defenders of apriorism share the assumption that we are capable of acquiring
knowledge of a special sort, called `<I>a priori</I> knowledge', via non-inductive
means. They differ, however, in their accounts of where such knowledge
comes from. Two broad families of apriorist views have to be distinguished
in this regard.
<P>On the one hand are what we might call <I>impositionist views</I>, which
hold that <I>a priori</I> knowledge is possible as a result of the fact
that the content of such knowledge reflects merely certain forms or structures
that have been imposed or inscribed upon the world by the knowing subject.
Knowledge, on such views, is never directly of reality itself; rather,
it reflects the `logical structures of the mind', and penetrates to reality
only as formed, shaped or modelled by a mind or theory.
<P>On the other hand are <I>reflectionist views</I>, which hold that we
can have <I>a priori</I> knowledge of what exists, independently of all
impositions or inscriptions of the mind, as a result of the fact that certain
structures in the world enjoy some degree of intelligibility in their own
right. The knowing subject and the objects of knowledge are for the reflectionist
in some sense and to some degree <I>pre-tuned</I> to each other. Direct
<I>a priori</I> knowledge of reality itself is therefore possible, at least
at some level of generality knowledge of the sort that is involved for
example when we recognize the validity of a proof in logic or geometry
(where it is difficult to defend the view that the character of validity
would be somehow imposed upon the objects in question by the epistemic
subject).
<P>This brings us to the principal argument of the reflectionist against
all versions of impositionism, which we might call the argument from arbitrariness.
Let us suppose, for the moment, that the impositionist is correct in his
view that the <I>a priori</I> quality of laws or propositions is entirely
a matter of impositions. Imagine, now, that the totality of all laws or
propositions is laid out before us. Is it to be completely arbitrary which
of these laws or propositions are to enjoy the `imposed' quality of aprioricity?
A positive answer to this question is belied by the extent to which there
is wide agreement across times and cultures as to which the candidate <I>a
priori</I> laws or propositions are. A negative answer, on the other hand,
implies that there is some special quality on the side of certain laws
or propositions themselves, in virtue of which precisely those laws or
propositions do indeed serve as the targets of imposition. Clearly, however,
this special quality must itself be prior to any sort of mental imposition
which might come to be effected, which means that the original impositionist
assumption, to the effect that the
<I>a priori</I> quality of laws or propositions
is entirely a matter of imposition, turns out to be self-refuting.
<P>The impositionist view finds its classical expression in the work of
Kant (whose ideas may be safe against the argument just presented), and
special versions of impositionism are to be found also in Hume (in his
treatment of causality), in Mach (in his theory of thought economy), and
in the work of the logical positivists. The reflectionist view, on the
other hand, finds its classical expression in Aristotle; it was developed
further by successive waves of scholastics extending far into the modern
era, and brought to perfection by Brentano and his successors, above all
by Adolf Reinach and other realist phenomenologists in the early years
of this century, the latter building on ideas set out by Husserl in his
<I>Logical Investigations</I>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>6. Against the Kantian Confusion</I></B>
<P>There are obvious affinities between the reflectionist view and the
doctrine of Austrian Aristotelianism outlined above. Reflectionism can
be made compatible also however with other, variant doctrines. Thus the
theories of <I>Verstehen</I> propounded by Dilthey (traces of which are
perhaps to be found also in Mises) can be said to result when the reflectionist
doctrine is combined with a cancellation (for the social sciences) of thesis
6., which asserts the possibility of detached scientific theory.
<P>For Menger, we have argued, at least some of the propositions of economics
are <I>a priori</I> in the sense that the corresponding structures enjoy
an intrinsic simplicity and intelligibility which makes them capable of
being grasped by the economic theorist in principle in a single instance.
Note again, however, that the fact that such structures are intelligible
need not by any means imply that our knowledge of them is in any sense
infallible or incorrigible, nor that it need in every case be easy to obtain
or to order into the form of a rigorous theory. Indeed much confusion in
the literature on Austrian methodology has arisen because the alien moment
of incorrigibility, together with connotations of special mental processes
of `insight' or `intuition', have come to be attached to the aprioristic
thesis in a way which has made the latter seem eccentric and unscientific.
<P>Still greater confusion has arisen, however, as a result of the no less
pervasive assumption that all talk of the <I>a priori</I> must of necessity
imply an impositionist or Kantian framework. For the apriorism lying in
the background of Menger's thinking is quite clearly reflectionist. Menger
believes that there are <I>a priori</I> categories (`essences' or `natures')
in reality and that <I>a priori</I> propositions reflect structures or
connections among such essences existing autonomously in the sense that
they are not the result of any shaping or forming of reality on the part
of the experiencing subject. The impositionist apriorist, in contrast,
insists that <I>a priori</I> categories must be creatures of the mind.
He, therefore, may hold that the issue as to which sorts of economic structures
exist is a matter for more or less arbitrary legislation by the economic
theorist, or a matter of the `conceptual spectacles' of the economic agent.
No grain of such ideas is to be found in Menger.
<P>Menger is working, rather, against the background of an assumption to
the effect that the universals of economic reality are not created or imposed
in any sense, but are discovered through our theoretical efforts. Economists
do not study concepts or other creatures of the mind. Rather, they study
the qualitative essences or natures of and the relations between such categories
as value, rent, profit, the division of labour, money, etc.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Theoretical economics has the task of investigating the <I>general
essence</I> and the <I>general connection</I> of economic phenomena, not
of analysing economic <I>concepts</I> and of drawing the conclusions resulting
from this analysis. The phenomena, or certain aspects of them, and not
their linguistic image, the concepts, are the object of theoretical research
in the field of economy. (Menger 1883, p. 6, n. 4, Eng. p. 37)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Menger, we might say in this light, seeks to develop a categorial ontology
of economic reality in just the Aristotelian sense, and in just the sense,
too, in which Brentano sought a categorial ontology of psychological reality.
He seeks to establish how the various different sorts of building blocks
of economic reality can be combined together in different sorts of simple
structured wholes, and to establish through the application of what he
himself called a genetico-compositive method how such wholes may originate
and how they may develop and become transformed over time into other kinds
of wholes.
<P>There is, however, one reason why an impositionist or Kantian reading
of Menger's views has seemed so tempting to so many. This turns on the
fact that Menger lays stress both on the subjectivism and on the methodological
individualism of economics. Indeed, the status and possibility of economics
as a theoretical science can be said to rest, in his eyes, precisely on
the acceptance of the two theses of subjectivism and methodological individualism.
For subjectivism implies that an economy is not an autonomous formation
with unintelligible properties of its own. Rather one can <I>understand</I>
the workings of an economy by coming to an understanding of how the value
of goods at earlier stages in the process of production is derived from
the value to actual consumers of the products of the later stages. Moreover,
one can see why this same understanding must apply <I>ceteris paribus</I>
to every economy in whatever time or place. Methodological individualism
implies that the whole of economics can in principle admit of an understanding
of this sort, that there are no economic structures that cannot be grasped
at least in principle in the thought-experiments of the economist. The
latter must, as it were, put himself into the shoes of the individual subjects
whose processes of thought and action come together to exemplify the structures
of which he treats.
<P>None of the above, however, implies that the economist's understanding
might flow from the fact that the propositions of economics reflect structures
that have been imposed upon the world in Kantian fashion by either the
economic theorist or the economic agent. That is, the intelligibility of
basic economic structures does not imply ontological dependence of such
structures on the mind along the lines suggested by the impositionist.
Rather, Menger's view implies precisely that economic reality is such as
to manifest certain simple intelligible structures in and of itself. Economic
reality is built up in intelligible ways out of structures involving human
thought and action. It is for this reason that we are able, by appropriate
efforts, to read off these structures in and of themselves.
<P>Such structures, because they are so simple, are (to different degrees)
intelligible. But for the same reason they are also universal, in the sense
that because they are indispensable to every economic action as such, or
to every instance of exchange, barter, rent, profit, etc. they are manifested
(in principle) in every economy. They are at least in principle intelligible
to everyone who has dealings with the objects concerned (i.e. to every
economic agent, to every observer of the behaviour of markets). Yet this
does not imply that it is in every case a simple matter to discover what
such structures are and nor, <I>a fortiori</I>, does it imply that it is
a simple matter to formulate workable theories about them.
<P>Austrian economics is entirely comparable in this respect to the more
recent `universals of language' research programme in linguistics. Here,
too, the assumption is made that there are structures in (linguistic) reality
which are universal to all languages. Such structures are at least tacitly
familiar to everyone who has dealings with the objects concerned (i.e.
to every speaker of a language). Yet this does not by any means imply that
it is a simple matter to discover what such structures are and to formulate
workable theories about them. Nor, either, does it imply that the issue
as to which sorts of linguistic structures are universal is a matter of
the `logical structure of the human mind' or of the `conceptual spectacles'
of the language-using subject. And nor does it imply that this issue is
merely a matter for arbitrary legislation by the linguistic theorist. Universals
of language are not created by the linguist. They are discovered, through
painstaking theoretical efforts.
<P>Apriorism in economics, now, does not mean any more than in the case
of linguistic universals that economic theory must be free of empirical
components. Indeed, it is a difficult matter to sort out precisely what
the appropriate role for empirical investigations in economics (and in
related disciplines) ought to be. This itself is not something that can
be decided <I>a priori</I>. What is certain for apriorists of whatever
hue, however, is that quantitative investigations in economics can be carried
out coherently only on the basis of at least some prior understanding of
the natures of the entities to be measured and compared. For otherwise
the economist is not merely measuring in the dark; he is also without any
means of tying down the results of his quantitative theorizing to economic
reality itself. Pre-empirical (qualitative) categorizations of this reality
must necessarily exist before empirical (quantitative) economics can begin.
The only issue is the extent to which such categorizations are conscious
and explicit.
<P>The ontological grammar of economic reality that is sketched by Menger
can be seen in this light as providing a pre-empirical qualitative framework
in whose terms specific empirical hypotheses can be formulated and specific
mathematical models be given concrete interpretation. Such a foundation
cannot itself be derived, on pain of circularity, either from empirical
investigations of the more usual sort or from mathematical analyses. It
must rather be derived at least in part or so the apriorist argues from
that familiarity with particular economic phenomena which we are all of
us able to acquire as economic agents.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>7. Mises, Kant and Positivism</I></B>
<P>That the author of <I>Human Action</I> sees his methodology primarily
in terms recalling Kantian doctrines is seen, for example, in passages
such as: `The a priori sciences logic, mathematics, and praxeology aim
at a knowledge unconditionally valid for all beings endowed with the logical
structure of the human mind' (Mises 1966, p. 57).
<P>We know now that there is an Aristotelian alternative to the Kantian
form of apriorism. This alternative seems not to have been explicitly recognized
as such by Mises; but this is hardly surprising, given that, for reasons
pointed out above, the special nature of Austrian Aristotelian apriorism
was appreciated by very few at the time when Mises was working out the
philosophical foundations of his praxeology.<SUP><A HREF="#N_23_">(23)</A></SUP>
<P>Common to all aprioristic doctrines is a view to the effect that there
are laws or propositions which are on the one hand universal and necessary
and on the other hand intelligible (capable of being grasped by non-inductive
means). Kantian impositionism is the view that such
<I>a priori</I> laws
or propositions reflect categorial impositions of the mind. As a result
of the influence of Frege and Wittgenstein, now, especially as filtered-down
through the logical positivism (logical atomism) of the Vienna circle,
recent Kantian varieties of apriorism have tended to take an extreme form
which sees such categorial impositions as effected always via logic or
language. More specifically, <I>a priori</I> propositions are seen as being
characterized by the fact that they can in every case be exposed via a
process of stripping out defined terms and replacing them with
<I>definiens</I>
consisting of more primitive expressions as mere tautologies or analytic
truths, entirely empty of content and consistent with any and every factual
state of the world. `All bachelors are married' is revealed as analytic
in this way by being converted into `All unmarried men are unmarried',
which is an instance of the logical truth: `All A's which are B are B'.
<P>Mises <I>qua</I> methodologist was very clearly tempted by the idea
that the laws of praxeology should be analytic in this sense. The theoretical
part of economics would then be a purely formal or analytic discipline
whose principles would flow from the logical analysis of certain concepts.
Consider, first of all, Mises' assertion to the effect that the propositions
of praxeology
<BLOCKQUOTE>are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic
and mathematics, a priori. They are not subject to verification or falsification
on the ground of experience and facts. They are both logically and temporally
antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts. They are a necessary
requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events. Without them
we should not be able to see in the course of events anything else than
kaleidoscopic change and chaotic muddle. (1966, p. 32)</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here the (Kant- and Wittgenstein-inspired) positivist conception of analyticity
is only latently at work. Almost all of the above would, if suitably interpreted,
be perfectly consistent with a view of praxeology as an <I>a priori</I>
discipline of economics conceived in reflectionist Aristotelian fashion.
When we read on, however, then we discover that Mises does in fact run
together what is <I>a priori</I> with what is analytic. Praxeology, we
are told, is like logic and mathematics in the sense that its content is
a matter of empty tautologies: `Aprioristic reasoning is purely conceptual
and deductive. It cannot produce anything else but tautologies and analytic
judgments.' Thus for example: `In the concept of money all the theorems
of monetary theory are already implied.' (1966, p. 38)
<P>Thus while impositionism is not explicitly defended by Mises <I>qua</I>
methodologist, he does insist on the analytic character of all <I>a priori</I>
propositions. The methodology which results is thereby rendered inconsistent
with a reflectionist apriorism, since it implies that <I>a priori</I> propositions
are empty of content, and clearly propositions that are empty of content
are unable to picture anything (intelligible) on the side of the objects
of the corresponding theory.
<P>If, however, we wish to hold on to the view that all the propositions
of praxeology are analytic in this sense, then we shall have to insist
that the whole of praxeology can be erected on the basis of premises involving
at most one single primitive non-logical concept.<SUP><A HREF="#N_24_">(24)</A></SUP>
For suppose that there were two such concepts, neither definable in terms
of the other. Consider, now, the propositions expressing the non-trivial
relations between these concepts. These cannot, <I>ex hypothesi</I>, be
analytic, for there are now no defined non-logical terms which could be
eliminated in such a way as to reveal the corresponding statements as truths
of logic, and no truth of logic contains a plurality of non-logical terms
in other than trivial ways. But nor, from the Misesian point of view, can
they be merely factual (synthetic <I>a posteriori</I>). On the positivist
reading of the aprioristic doctrine, however, no third alternative is available,
which implies that the original assumption that there are two (or more)
such concepts must be rejected.<SUP><A HREF="#N_25_">(25)</A></SUP> This
helps to make intelligible the repeated insistence of Mises and his followers
(and critics) that there is but one single non-logical concept (or `category'
or `essence') of the praxeological discipline, the concept
<I>human action</I>,
from which all propositions of the discipline would somehow be derived:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The scope of praxeology is the explication of the category
of human action. All that is needed for the deduction of all praxeological
theorems is knowledge of the essence of human action ... The only way to
a cognition of these theorems is logical analysis of our inherent knowledge
of the category of action... Like logic and mathematics, praxeological
knowledge is in us; it does not come from without. (1966, p. 64)<SUP><A HREF="#N_26_">(26)</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR><B><I>8. Mises the Aristotelian</I></B>
<P>When once we examine Mises' <I>practice</I>, however, then a quite different
picture emerges, and we discover that Mises, too, was not at his best in
his methodological self-interpretations. For we are forced to recognize
that there is a veritable plenitude of non-logical primitive concepts at
the root of praxeology. Indeed, Mises' descriptions of this plenitude in
his actual practice in economics, and also in occasional passages in his
methodological writings,<SUP><A HREF="#N_27_">(27)</A></SUP> can be seen
to represent what is almost certainly the most sustained realization of
the Aristotelian idea in the literature of economic theory.
<P>Action, we are told by Mises, involves <I>apprehension of causal relations
and of regularities in the phenomena</I>. It presupposes <I>being in a
position to influence causal relations</I>. It presupposes <I>felt uneasiness</I>.
It involves the <I>exercise of reason</I>. It is a <I>striving to substitute
a more satisfactory for a less satisfactory state of affairs</I>.
<P>Acting man <I>transfers the valuation of ends he aims at to the means
he anticipates utilizing</I>. Action <I>takes time</I>, which like other
<I>scarce factors</I> must be <I>economized</I>. Action presupposes <I>choosing
between various opportunities offered for choice</I>.
<P>Action involves <I>the expectation that purposeful behaviour has the
power to remove or at least alleviate uneasiness</I>. It presupposes the
<I>uncertainty of the future</I>. It involves <I>meanings which the acting
parties attribute to the situation</I>. A thing becomes a <I>means</I>
only when reason
<I>plans to employ it for the attainment of some end and
action really employs it for this purpose</I>.
<P>Certainly some of the concepts involved in the above may reasonably
be counted as logical concepts; others may no less reasonably he conceived
as being introduced by definitions formulated in terms of other, more primitive
concepts. Consider, however, the concepts
<I>causation,</I> <I>relative
satisfactoriness</I>, <I>reason</I>, <I>uneasiness</I>, <I>valuation</I>,
<I>anticipation</I>, <I>means</I>, <I>ends</I>,
<I>utilization</I>, <I>time</I>,
<I>scarcity</I>, <I>opportunity</I>, <I>choice</I>, <I>uncertainty</I>,
<I>expectation</I>, etc., etc. The idea that one could simultaneously and
without circularity reduce every one of the concepts in this family to
the single concept of action, that they could all be defined by purely
logical means in terms of this one single concept, is decisively to be
rejected.<SUP><A HREF="#N_28_">(28)</A></SUP>
<P>How much better would it be to accept that we are dealing here with
a family of <I>a priori</I> categories and categorial structures which
would be, in the jargon, not analytic but synthetic. The laws governing
such structures can almost all of them be very easily expressed in the
form of what linguists like to call `implicative universals', which is
to say principles to the effect that, if instances of some given species
or category K<SUB>1</SUB> exist, then as a matter of necessity these and
those other categories K<SUB>2</SUB>,...,K<SUB>n</SUB> must be instantiated
also. Instances of the necessitating category K<SUB>1</SUB> are then said
to be one-sidedly dependent upon instances of the necessitated categories
K<SUB>2</SUB>,...,K<SUB>n</SUB>. The formal ontological theory of such
dependence relations has been worked out in some detail.<SUP><A HREF="#N_29_">(29)</A></SUP>
It can be illustrated in Menger's already mentioned account of the essence
of goods at the beginning of the <I>Principles</I>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>If instances of the species <I>good</I> exist, then there exist
also instances of the species <I>need</I>,
<I>human being</I>, <I>causal
connection</I>, <I>knowledge</I>, <I>command</I>, etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
And it is to be found at work also in the context of Misesian praxeology,
for example in laws such as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>If instances of the species <I>action</I> exist, then there
exist also instances of the species <I>choice</I>, <I>apprehension of causal
regularities</I>, <I>felt uneasiness</I>, etc.
<P>If instances of the species <I>choice of ends</I> exist, then so also
do instances of the species <I>apprehension of causal regularities</I>,
etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
We might represent the <I>a priori</I> relations between such species (relations
of <I>de re</I> necessitation) in diagrammatic form as follows, employing
links connecting broken to solid walls of adjacent frames to represent
relations of one-sided dependence between the entities concerned:

<P>A diagram of this sort is, we might say, a picture of an <I>a priori</I>
structure in the sphere of human action. Similar diagrams can be produced
also following indications set out by Reinach in his monograph on speech
act theory of 1913 for the <I>a priori</I> necessitation structures exemplified
by speech acts of the various different types,<SUP><A HREF="#N_30_">(30)</A></SUP>
and I have sought elsewhere to show how they can be extended also to the
structures of entrepreneurial perception analysed by Israel Kirzner, for
example in his 1979.<SUP><A HREF="#N_31_">(31)</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><I>9. If Austrian economics did not exist, would it be necessary
to invent it?</I></B>
<P>Austrian economics, we have said, is both theoretical and subjectivist.
Neoclassical economics, in contrast, is neither the one nor the other.
For it rests on the positivist thesis that economic reality lacks intrinsic
intelligibility <I>tout court</I>, so that no non-trivial part of economic
theory could be <I>a priori</I> in any of the senses distinguished above.
The propositions of economics are mere inductive hypotheses, and the method
of economics consists in the building of testable models, selection among
which is effected, at least in principle, on the basis of relative predictive
strength. Because realism (in the reflectionist sense) falls out of account
as a criterion of selection, such models are repeatedly threatened with
becoming shorn of their relation to those basic everyday categories in
which the science of economics has its roots. Austrian economics, in contrast,
is marked by a willingness to sacrifice both the goal of predictive power
and the mathematical tools associated therewith precisely in order to come
to an understanding of these basic categories themselves.
<P>The contrast here has seemed to many to justify the striking of pugilistic
attitudes. From the Aristotelian apriorist perspective, however, it might
begin to appear as if the principles underlying both sorts of economic
methodology might possess some grain of truth. For Austrian economics might
then be conceived not as an alternative to the economics of model-building
and prediction but as a preliminary activity of establishing this missing
connection to ground-level economic realities. Austrian economics might,
in other words, be conceived as a safe harbour for a practice which at
present takes place among neo-classicists only surreptitiously and unsystematically
a practice sometimes referred to under the rubric of `taking subjectivism
seriously'. This practice might also be conceived as the attempt to exert
control in the direction of greater commonsensical realism over the model-building
tendencies of mathematical economists. The exercise of such control might
lead from this admittedly somewhat idealized perspective to the construction
of different kinds of models. But then also it may even be that empirical
and mathematical economics will in certain circumstances lead to results
which constrain a revision of Austrian economics itself. A view of this
sort can be found in germ already in the work of Wieser.<SUP><A HREF="#N_32_">(32)</A></SUP>
He, too, saw economic theory as beginning with the description based in
part on introspection, as he saw it of the simplest structures of economic
reality, a description which may then be supplemented and to some extent
corrected by empirical research into the various ways in which these simple
structures may come to be affected contingently, e.g. in different social
and historical contexts.
<P>For the moment, though, I am suggesting merely that we consider a thought-experiment,
or pipe-dream, to the effect that Austrian economics might be seen as providing
a certain sort of foundation for empirical-mathematical economics in something
like the way in which geometry provides a foundation for the discipline
of physics. We have said that from the Aristotelian perspective a proposition's
being <I>a priori</I> signifies that it (or the structure which makes it
true) enjoys some degree of intelligibility. What it does not signify,
is that our knowledge of such a proposition must be in any sense incorrigible
or infallible. Indeed, the idea that empirical discoveries might lead in
principle to a correction of the <I>a priori</I> foundation of the economic
discipline opens up the exciting prospect of something like a <I>non-Euclidean</I>
Austrian economics, perhaps even to a family of such non-Euclidean disciplines,
each of which could claim some degree of <I>a priori</I> support. I must
confess at once, however, that I have no notion as to how such disciplines
might look.

<P><A NAME="N_1_"></A>1. See the items listed in the bibliography below,
especially my 1986 and 1989, and compare also Fabian and Simons 1986.
<P><A NAME="N_2_"></A>2. Here we can distinguish as sources of Menger's
Aristotelianism first of all the `<I>Popularphilosophie</I>' which was
imposed on educational institutions throughout the Habsburg Empire and
which incorporated, besides elements derived from the thinking of Leibniz
and Wolff, also watered-down versions of Aristotelian and scholastic doctrines.
Secondly, there is the 19th century German and Austrian textbook tradition
in the social sciences. Here Aristotelian elements played a crucial role
not only in the textbook literature of economics (and not least in the
work of Mischler, under whom Menger had studied), but also in textbooks
of history, legal theory and for example in the writings on political householding
of the cameralists (discussed by Silverman in his 1989). On Mischler, see
Streissler 1989.
<P><A NAME="N_3_"></A>3. Valuable source-material in this respect has been
assembled in Milford 1988, who however draws different conclusions from
the cited texts, above all because he is concentrating on the implications
of Menger's work for economic
<I>methodology</I>. Here, in contrast, I
am concerned with more basic matters of general philosophy.
<P><A NAME="N_4_"></A>4. The most relevant material is summarized in Grassl
and Smith, eds., 1986. See also the papers collected in Ny&iacute;ri, ed.,
1986.
<P><A NAME="N_5_"></A>5. Such misplaced charity is illustrated for example
in the decision of Menger's translators to translate the technical (and
in Menger's usage Aristotelian) term `<I>Wesen</I>', normally and correctly
translated as `essence', with the more colloquial `nature'. (The translations
given here have been adjusted accordingly.)
<P>For an illuminating discussion of an interestingly parallel case of
misplaced charity in interpretation, see Meikle 1985 (esp. pp. 8ff.), which
rightly lays stress on the Aristotelianism at the core of Marx's thinking.
Meikle's work is one among many indications of the extent to which, among
philosophers at least, Aristotelian ideas are beginning once more to be
taken seriously.
<P><A NAME="N_6_"></A>6. The <I>Investigations</I> are, as Alter rightly
stresses (1989, pp. 12f.), a critique of the methodological views of the
German historicists. They are not the positive statement of Menger's own
thinking in this respect announced in 1883, p. 43n (Eng. p. 62).
<P><A NAME="N_7_"></A>7. This thesis is defended at length in my 1987.
I believe that the remarks in the text have important consequences also
for the correct interpretation of Hayek's thinking. Thus John Gray's contention
that Hayek's "central theory" is fundamentally Kantian in nature, a thesis
based on part on Hayek's own retrospective self-interpretation, is otherwise
supported by very little evidence in either the spirit or the letter of
Hayek's writings. It is essentially one single passage from Hayek's <I>The
Sensory Order</I> which is held by Gray to mark the Kantian strain in Hayek's
thought: `The fact that the world which we know seems wholly an orderly
world may thus be merely a result of the method by which we perceive it.'
(Hayek 1952, 8.39, cf. Gray, p. 12)
<P>When taken in its context, this passage is part of the physiological
argument of <I>The Sensory Order</I> - an argument in the spirit of Mach
- to the effect that it is the physical similarity of stimuli and their
relative frequency of occurrence which gives rise to the order of our sensations.
Like other relevant writings of Hayek, such as his "Rules, Perception and
Intelligibility" of 1962, it presents a picture of a philosopher allied
with Mach and the early precursors of what later came to be called `Gestalt
psychology', a picture which is supported also by a historical examination
of the influences on Hayek's thought at the time when the first version
of <I>The Sensory Order</I> was being written. For both Hayek and Mach,
now, there is no distinction between the phenomenal and noumenal world.
Indeed there is no transcendentalism of any sort in either thinker. Yet
Kantianism, as one normally conceives it, is characterized precisely by
the presence of such a transcendental dimension.
<P><A NAME="N_8_"></A>8. See the relevant section of Alter (forthcoming),
and also the material collected in Grassl and Smith (eds.) for a treatment
of this issue in relation to Menger. For the views of the Brentanists on
ethics and the theory of value see Kraus 1937.
<P><A NAME="N_9_"></A>9. See the discussion of universals <I>in re</I>
in Johansson 1989, e.g. pp. 11, 147, and also Maki 1989.
<P><A NAME="N_10_"></A>10. On the opposition between commonsense and scientific
realism from the point of view of contemporary philosophy see Devitt 1984.
Compare also the illuminating discussion of `level ontologies' in Johansson
1989, pp. 26ff.
<P><A NAME="N_11_"></A>11. Cf. Maki 1989.
<P><A NAME="N_12_"></A>12. Cf. Menger 1883, p. 40, Eng. p. 60 on the `rule
of cognition' for the investigation of theoretical truth':
<P>There is one rule of cognition for the investigation of theoretical
truths which is not only, as far as this is possible, verified by experience,
but is verified in indubitable fashion by our very laws of thinking....
This is the thesis that <I>whatever was observed in even only one case
must always come to appearance again under exactly the same factual conditions</I>
... This rule holds not only of the <I>essence</I> of phenomena, but also
of their <I>measure</I> (translation amended).
<P><A NAME="N_13_"></A>13. Cf. Menger 1871, p. 3, Eng. p. 52 (section 1,
"On the Essence of Goods").
<P><A NAME="N_14_"></A>14. Cf. Gould 1978, Wood 1981, Sowell 1985, and
above all Meikle 1985. In the light of 6. above it is worth pointing out
that Marx embraces also the assumption that science is able to penetrate
through the ideological obfuscations by which the commonsensical mind is
(as he conceives things) of necessity affected.
<P><A NAME="N_15_"></A>15. The survival of Aristotelian ideas in contemporary
German legal theory is illustrated for example by Karl Larenz's standard
textbook of legal methodology (1983), e.g. in his discussion of the `legal
structural types' which the legal theorist `discovers in reality' (p. 338).
<P><A NAME="N_16_"></A>16. Cf. Meikle 1985, p. 6, n. 4

trans. by E. Haldane and F. Simson, London, 1894, vol. 2, p. 147, emphasis
mine.
<P><A NAME="N_18_"></A>18. See, on this, my 1986a and also the papers collected
in Grassl and Smith, eds., 1986.
<P><A NAME="N_19_"></A>19. On methodological individualism in Aristotle
see also Kraus 1905.
<P><A NAME="N_20_"></A>20. See Menger's discussion of the view attributed
to Aristotle to the effect that the state is a phenomenon co-original with
the existence of man, in his 1883, pp. 267-270, Eng. pp. 220-222.
<P><A NAME="N_21_"></A>21. Passage cited by Marx himself in the Afterword
to the Second German Edition of vol. 1 of <I>Capital</I> and adopted as
a motto to Meikle 1985.
<P><A NAME="N_22_"></A>22. See esp. Streissler 1989.
<P><A NAME="N_23_"></A>23. Again, the work of the phenomenologist Adolf
Reinach is especially important in this regard. For Reinach, who achieved
for legal science what Menger and his school have achieved in the field
of economics, was especially aware of the non-Kantian nature of his aprioristic
views. See also ch. 2 of Max Scheler's <I>Formalism in Ethics</I>, a work
in part inspired by the reflectionist theory of the <I>a priori</I> defended
by Reinach.
<P><A NAME="N_24_"></A>24. We shall need, too, some criterion as to what
is to count as a non-logical concept. Consider, for example, the concept
<I>part of</I>. This is a formal concept, in the sense that it can be applied,
in principle, to all matters without restriction. But it is not treated
as a logical concept in the standard textbooks, and nor can it be defined
in terms of the logical concepts which are standardly recognized as such.
Indeed it seems that the concept <I>part of</I> is a non-logical primitive
concept. Consider, now, the proposition
<P>If A is part of B, and B is part of C, then A is part of C.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>which asserts that the corresponding relation is transitive. This proposition
is not analytic, for there is no law of logic to which it would correspond
as a substitution instance. Hence it must be synthetic. But it is surely
also <I>a priori</I>, and indeed <I>a priori</I> in the (reflectionist)
sense that it pictures the (intelligible) way in which part-whole relations
are nested together in the world, independent of our thoughts and actions.
<P><A NAME="N_25_"></A>25. I have developed this argument at greater length
in my 1986.
<P><A NAME="N_26_"></A>26. See also Rothbard 1957.
<P><A NAME="N_27_"></A>27. Consider for example the paragraph beginning
`The most general...' on p. 24 of his 1981.
<P><A NAME="N_28_"></A>28. Hans-Hermann Hoppe's 1988, to which I hope to
return elsewhere, is an interesting defence of a purportedly Kantian reading
of Mises which seeks to break through the opposition between impositionism
and reflectionism set out above.
<P><A NAME="N_29_"></A>29. See Smith (ed.) 1982, Simons 1987, Part III,
and Johansson 1989, Ch. 9.
<P><A NAME="N_30_"></A>30. Compare the papers collected in Mulligan, ed.,
1987.
<P><A NAME="N_31_"></A>31. See my 1986. Marx, too, utilized necessitation
structures of exactly this sort, for example in his analysis of human work
in chapter 5 of Book 1 of
<I>Capital</I>. See, on this, my 1988.
<P><A NAME="N_32_"></A>32. See e.g. Wieser 1927, pp. 5ff. The idea may
be less at home in Menger's own thinking. For Menger the idea of
<P>Testing the exact theory of economy by the full empirical method is
simply a methodological absurdity, a failure to recognize the basis of
presuppositions of exact research (1883, p. 54, Eng. p. 69).
<P>Examining Menger's account of the ways in which exact types are painstakingly
extracted from the realm of economic phenomena by the economic theorist
suggests however that he, too, might have assented to something like the
retroactive control that is here described. See, on this whole issue, Menger's
promissory note on p. 43 (Eng. p. 62) of the <I>Investigations</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
