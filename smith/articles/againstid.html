<p><br><font face="Times New Roman">To seek to elucidate Husserl's phenomenology
by contrasting it with that of the Munich phenomenologist Johannes Daubert
(1877-1947) is to betray an intention to explain something well-known by
reference to something that is wholly obscure. Thus most philosophers are
somehow aware of Edmund Husserl. But Johannes Daubert?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daubert's near-total
eclipse is no accident. Although we have no hesitation in calling him --
and not Husserl -- the true architect of the phenomenological movement,
it nonetheless remains true that he 'never published a line'.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
It has therefore been impossible for the wider philosophical public to
become acquainted with the thought of a philosopher whom Husserl himself
held in highest esteem, ever since their first meeting in 1902.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">It was through lectures
and discussions extending over several years that Daubert's influence made
itself felt -- discussions which were a major factor in the establishment
of phenomenology in both Munich and G&ouml;ttingen.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
But discontinuities in the phenomenological tradition caused by two World
Wars and the Hitler Reich hampered the handing down of Daubert's teachings,
which had already reached the high point of their influence in the first
decade of the century.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Still more important
is the fact that Daubert, who volunteered for the army in 1914, withdrew
after the war to a farm he had bought for himself outside Munich. This
spelled, for the time being at least, the end of his active philosophising.
He lost contact with the new generation of students that was establishing
itself in Munich, though he always remained in touch with Alexander Pf&auml;nder,
the then leading spokesman of Munich phenomenology. To use Berkeley's words,
Daubert united 'in his own person the philosopher and the farmer, two characters
not so inconsistent in nature as by custom they seem to be.'<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">However, the most important
stumbling block standing in the way of a wider knowledge of Daubert's phenomenology
are his very manuscripts, which he kept with him at his farm to the end
of his life. They were transferred in 1967 to the Bavarian State Library
in Munich, where they were classified under the sigil 'Daubertiana'.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
Even then, however, they remained inaccessible to the reader in virtue
of the highly unusual system of shorthand which Daubert had used throughout.
Only in 1976 did Schuhmann manage to break this code.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 1. Daubertiana File A I 3 and
<i>Ideas</i>
I</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Daubert must have studied Husserl's <i>Ideas</i>
I during at least three different periods. He first read the work immediately
after its publication (around May 1913). At that time <i>Ideas</i> I was
for him, as for his friend Alexander Pf&auml;nder, mainly a confirmation
of the common ground shared by both Husserl and the Munich group.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup>
A second phase is confirmed by Pf&auml;nder's letter to Husserl of March
28, 1915. Daubert was then at the front, and Pf&auml;nder sent him '<i>Ideas</i>
I at his own request, fascicule by fascicule'.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert's most extensive
discussion of the <i>Ideas</i> is however to be found in the file Daubertiana
A I 3, the majority of whose 173 double folio pages were written between
February 1930 and September 1931.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup> Daubert
sold his farm in 1929 and bought a new one only in the Spring of 1932,
taking advantage of the intervening period to make a fresh start in philosophy.
What made him resume work after an interruption of some fifteen years was
his plan to contribute to the forthcoming <i>Festschrift</i> in honour
of his friend Pf&auml;nder's sixtieth birthday. Eventually the book appeared
without such a contribution, though there is preserved a proof of an early
version of its table of contents announcing Daubert's projected contribution
under the title "Zur Ph&auml;nomenologie der Evidenz". All that has come
down to us of Daubert's project are the drafts contained in file A I 3.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert's work is characterised
by a constant striving to include relevant ideas of other philosophers
in his discussions. Indeed it had been his endeavour to take account of
other people's thought that had led him in 1902 to the discovery of Husserl's
phenomenology, and even in 1930 his reception of the pertinent literature
is still astonishingly up-to-date, especially when one bears in mind that
he had stayed aloof from developments in philosophy for so long. Among
the works setting the tone for his reflections are "Zur Ontologie und Erscheinungslehre
der realen Aussenwelt" by Hedwig Conrad-Martius, Martin Heidegger's <i>Being
and Time</i>, Theodor Celms' book <i>Der ph&auml;nomenologische Idealismus
Husserls</i> (1928), Ingarden's "Bemerkungen zum Problem Idealismus-Realismus",
published in the Husserl- Festschrift of 1929, and above all Aron Gurwitsch's
"Ph&auml;nomenologie der Thematik und des reinen Ich", published in the
1929 issue of the <i>Psychologische Forschung</i>, house journal of the
Berlin Gestalt psychologists. What all these works have in common, of course,
is their opposition to Husserl's idealism.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Twenty-nine full folio
pages of file A I 3 refer explicitly to <i>Ideas</i> I. A survey of the
manuscript shows that Part I of Husserl's work does not really detain Daubert's
attention. He pays more attention to the concepts of natural attitude and
epoch and to the treatment of the relation between world and consciousness
dealt with in Part II. In relation to Part III, Daubert briefly discusses
Husserl's theory of the noema before subjecting to an extensive discussion
the question of positing [<i>setzende</i>] acts. The detailed discussion
of the phenomenology of reason of Part IV is well in keeping with Daubert's
overall aim in file A I 3 of developing a phenomenology of evidence.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">All of these reflections
are held together by a common interest in the problem of the subject's
cognitive relation to the world, mainly to the world of nature. How can
reality be given in and to consciousness? How does the identical thing
present itself in or through a multiplicity of phenomena? How is true and
evident cognition of "things out there" possible at all? In answering these
questions Daubert develops a strikingly original alternative to the Husserlian
conception of the relation between <i>consciousness</i>, which for Husserl
is notoriously taken as something absolute, and <i>reality</i>, which was
Daubert's own point of departure. We shall see that in a certain sense
he stands Husserl on his head.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 2. On Perceiving a Tree</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Perception is normally seen as providing
the fundamental layer in our experience of objects. A phenomenology of
perception is therefore basic to all further reflection on the relation
between consciousness and world. Indeed Husserl introduces his description
of the structures of consciousness in <i>Ideas</i> I with 'a series of
observations' on our natural directedness to the external world in perception
(60). Thinking, reflection and therefore also phenomenology itself presuppose
perception as the original mode of awareness of the natural world. But
at the same time this perceptual acquaintance with reality cannot legitimate
its own contents and is thus not proof against sceptical doubt. For this
reason Husserl regards the natural attitude, which accepts the claims of
perception at face value, as no more than 'the conception of the naive
human being' (69).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D<font face="Times New Roman">aubert, too, holds
to a certain primacy of perception. But for him the value of reflection
-- or of a philosophical theory -- is not measured by the degree to which
it might overcome perception. The value of reflection depends rather upon
its capacity to remain faithful to perception as the source from which
it sprang. This estimate of perception as a <i>non plus ultra</i> clearly
differs considerably from Husserl's own. Thus Daubert writes:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Precisely that which I perceive
and which is given to me by way of perception is real and has its place
in reality; it has its chemical structure, it burns, etc. There is nothing
behind it. (143r)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">This remark is of course prompted by Husserl's
statement to the effect that</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">the tree <i>simpliciter</i> can
burn, be resolved into its chemical elements, etc. But the sense -- the
sense of this perception...- cannot burn; it has no chemical elements (184).<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Now Husserl's tree-example is designed to
serve as an illustration of the relation between noema and real thing.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup>
Both are '"precisely the same"' in regard to what is given, yet at the
same time 'radically different, by virtue of...a change of sign' (184).
Husserl's own quotation marks around the first of these two phrases mark
the fact that the identity in question is to be understood only in an extenuated
sense, and that Daubert is therefore justified in interpreting Husserl's
statement as signifying a doubling of the object pole of the perceptual
act. Husserl's duplication of reality, which is reminiscent of Plato's
distinction between an intelligible and a sensible world, is of course
in accord with his own self-avowed 'platonic realism' (40). For Daubert,
however, it signals a reduction in the significance that is awarded to
'real' reality, a first crucial step in the direction of idealism.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert, for his part,
refuses the very distinction between real object and perceptual sense.
Certainly we may suffer perceptual illusion and error -- and Daubert will
have to account for the divergences from reality which such phenomena involve
-- but any attempt to understand them will itself have to build firmly
on the basis of the one, omnipresent world. There is for Daubert 'nothing
beyond it' (143r), no <i>Hinterwelt</i>. All occurrences belonging to subjective
experience are to be described as they are, entangled with this world.
It may, e.g., be true that the tree as such can burn while my subjective
experience of the tree cannot. But on the other hand it pertains to this
very experience that the tree I perceive may catch fire, that it may be
blown down in a storm, that it is rooted in the surrounding reality in
a whole variety of ways. Does an attempt to understand the sense of my
perception without extending it to the real tree out there still make sense
of <i>this</i> perception? Considerations of this kind apparently underlie
Daubert's refusal to accept a two world theory, and his affirmation that
'precisely that which I perceive...is real' (143r) is a corollary to this.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 3. Consciousness as Function</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Daubert's denial of a self-subsisting
layer of senses whose ties to reality could be loosened or even -- in a
reduction -- dispensed with entirely, has far-reaching consequences. For
it will prove that consciousness 'exists' only when and insofar as it is
involved in this reality. One cannot ascribe to consciousness any existence
of its own, independent of this immediate connection with the natural world.
Daubert thereby goes beyond Husserl in affirming the inadequacy of any
Aristotelian conception of consciousness in terms of beams or rays emitted
by a special 'ego-substance'.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup> Consciousness
itself cannot be grasped in terms of this conception, because it is nothing
in front of us, nothing on which the beam can fall, and, with this, nothing
substantial. Indeed Daubert wants to insist that 'that in which reality
shows itself is nothing existing by itself, but only a <i>function directed
towards reality</i>' (62v, our emphasis).<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
He is clear that:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness is not a being in
itself but rather something which functions only in something else [<i>was
nur in Anderes funktioniert</i>] and in which something else functions
in its turn [<i>und in welches hinein Anderes funktioniert</i>]. The functioning
being of consciousness has no special existence of its own and is nothing
real (11v).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">No other phenomenologist except Sartre seems
to be so explicit in denying the existence of consciousness, taken for
itself, and there are Sartrean echoes also in Daubert's emphasis on the
distinction between consciousness as a matter of functioning acts and consciousness
which goes on holiday e.g. by being made into an object of reflection.
Notwithstanding such similarities, however, Daubert's argument has little
in common with Sartre's sweeping identification of consciousness and nothingness.
The latter is motivated as much by metaphysical desires stemming from Hegel
and Descartes as by a phenomenological concern to describe what is given
in experience.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert explains his
notion of function by means of the following analogy:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness taken as act, [i.e.]
insofar as it functions, has in contrast to the object no existence of
its own. Only when I reflect on it does it cease to function and seem to
have a being of its own. This resembles the problem of the 'and'. Does
it receive a being of its own in virtue of the changed or wholly new position
we take up in thematising it? At this point, Husserl makes his fundamental
mistake. This positing, which renders consciousness thematic, thereby reinterprets
it in the direction of a peculiar being which is alien to it, or of a form
or an achievement made up of real components of mental processes. The static
character which thematising dictates is reinterpreted as a static existence.
(142r, our emphasis)<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Or consider the predication '"And" is a conjunction'.
Here, as Daubert points out:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">'And' is not an existent object
at all, but a function. But here it is the theme, and so it gains its existence
when I characterise it as a conjunction. (140r)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">These reflections clearly refer to Husserl's
treatment in the fourth Logical Investigation of the problem of how to
understand syncategoremata when torn from their context.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
Husserl had said that when we believe ourselves to understand syncategoremata
as such, i.e. taken in isolation, then this can only be because a completion
of their signification has occurred and an <i>anomalous signification</i>
has thereby been indirectly awarded to them. Thus an isolated 'and', for
example, is understood by means of a tacit reference to an idea of the
type 'A and B'.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the theory of
the modification of significations which allowed Husserl to develop his
theory of formal ontology, for it provided him with a way of referring
to such entities as concepts,
<i>Sachverhalte</i>, species, abstract moments,
etc., without presupposing that the referents of these terms exist in the
same way as do, e.g., physical things. Anomalous referring expressions
are not nonsense, on Husserl's theory (as they are for Wittgenstein in
the <i>Tractatus</i>). Their sense is, rather, modified in a certain way.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daubert's treatment
of consciousness is, now, an extension of Husserl's theory of modification.
Consciousness is not an object at all. To consider it as such is to mistake
a mere function -- which is, to coin a phrase, in need of saturation by
its object -- for an object in the world.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>
The very term 'consciousness' cannot be understood except via a supplementation
of its meaning. The term is a relative noun, reflecting the fact that consciousness
is always consciousness <i>of.</i> Its use as a categorematic substantive
is therefore anomalous, a view that is corroborated by observing that the
very term 'consciousness' and its equivalents in other European languages
has itself been artificially forged by philosophers only relatively recently.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 4. The Question of Idealism</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness functions in a <i>normal</i>
way only when it 'hits' an object. This thesis carries for Daubert the
implication that consciousness may acquire a status of its own, may come
to be substantivised as an 'ego', only by becoming deprived of this, its
original function. It is in imaginative or hypothetical thinking, in neutralisation
or reduction (cf. 249f.), when consciousness seems to withdraw in different
ways from contact with reality, that it acquires a pseudo-being of its
own. But in Daubert's view the entanglement with reality is still preserved,
though veiled and hidden, even in these modifications, and the direct awareness
of reality is at work even in the phenomenological epoch itself.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This entanglement with
reality, which dooms all purported suspensions of the world to draw on
it come what may, makes it impossible for phenomenology to achieve any
'pure' description of an 'absolute' consciousness. As Daubert notes: 'Without
a persistent reality no cognition would be possible at all' (19v), not
even that type of cognition which allows the phenomenological elucidation
of consciousness. Thus where Husserl would have phenomenology operate 'exclusively
in acts of reflection' (174), i.e. exclusively in 'acts of second order'
(95), Daubert objects that the foundations of such acts cannot simply be
forgotten. 'One cannot derive any reality whatsoever from pure consciousness'
(16r), i.e. from acts of second order taken alone.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question of idealism,
according to Daubert, cannot be settled on the basis of the peculiar and
exceptional nature of reflective consciousness. 'In a strictly reflective
attitude I could not attain to transcendent objects,' he says (7v). The
issue of idealism is to be decided only by taking careful account of normal
experience, which involves our functioning in some way towards an object.
And to skip over the objective term involved in the problem is not to solve
but to avoid it.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">If for fundamental reasons
the real object remains outside consciousness, Husserl's idealism will
eventually retain its right, or rather, it will become plausible, for there
will be no argument left for the realist case (16v).</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 5. <i>Hyle</i> and Thing</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Phenomenological reflection 'can only
present the essential features of acts of consciousness' (61v). Now as
Husserl conceives the matter in <i>Ideas</i> I, it is essential to an act
of consciousness that it have an ego-pole, that it be an act of a phenomenological
subject. It is not however essential -- not even for an act that is experienced
as an act of perception -- that it have such and such a real, transcendent
object. But by this means the pure ego acquires the status of an absolute
substance, reality that of a mere dependent accident.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>
Husserl's awarding an absolute status to pure consciousness and a relative
status to the world of objects is thereby, as he himself admits, a reversal
of 'the sense usually expressed in speaking of what is' (93). As Daubert
insists, however, the sense of 'reality' and 'existence' becomes established
in everyday language, prior to any philosophising, and it cannot be the
task of phenomenology to overthrow this sense but only to elucidate it:
phenomenology must be 'inner clarification of the given' not criticism
in the sense of 'theory from above' (16v). Husserl nonetheless insists
upon his 'reversal of sense'. Consciousness as he conceives it never in
fact reaches out to real reality. It is directed instead toward a pseudo-reality
constituted by consciousness to its own specifications. With this we come
to a further task which Daubert has to take up against <i>Ideas</i> I:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Husserl's phrase: 'all being is
either pure consciousness or a being constituted by pure consciousness'
will be shown to contain an internal contradiction (92v).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Daubert takes as his starting point an interpretation
of constitution as an active production of noemata through the animation
of hyletic (sensory) data in the stream of acts. What gets constituted
in this process is a structure of noemata. To this he objects that, if
transcendence is brought about by a progressive bestowal of sense, then
'the world would become progressively constituted -- it would develop in
the very process of cognition itself' (9r). The movement of thought and
reality would coincide, and Husserl's absolute consciousness, this '"absolute
being", would be such as to comprehend the real thing even in its material
nature' (7v). But the Husserlian view thus loses sight of the transcendent
object by making of it an immanent part of consciousness. Alluding to Wilhelm
Windelband's famous definition of idealism as 'the dissolution of the experiential
world into processes of consciousness',<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>
Daubert says that Husserl's idealism 'finally solves the enigma of enigmas
(consciousness "<i>of</i>") by means of an ontological dissolution of one
reality into another' (61r).<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now of course Husserl
always protested against confounding his own, phenomenological idealism
with any idealism of the traditional sort. Does not the reference to Windelband
prove that Daubert has been misled by superficial resemblances between
Husserl's and e.g. Berkeley's position? Does he not impute to Husserl a
position which he himself explicitly rejected? Such a view, for all its
attractiveness, would be over-hasty. True, the noema is indeed, over against
the stream of consciousness, 'something fundamentally other, not really
inherent but transcendent' (204). But in the same breath Husserl affirms
that this irreducible element is constituted '"on the ground of" the material
mental processes "by" the noetic functions' (204). So this element finds
some sort of last 'ground' in consciousness after all, more specifically
in hyletic data<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup> -- and the latter are
undoubtedly immanent in consciousness. Husserl insisted repeatedly, and
especially with hyletic data in mind, that consciousness is 'consciousness
through and through' (208).<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup> Thus, even
the coming into being of hyletic data is to be described in terms of a
(temporal) constitution in consciousness.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are good reasons
why Daubert is so worried by Husserl's conception of hyletic stuff as a
really inherent part of consciousness. 'Hyletic data are not real component
parts of consciousness, because consciousness as a whole is itself nothing
real' (124v). To make the hyle belong to consciousness would amount to
making the former a property or accident of the latter, and with this one
would relapse into the reification of consciousness and into the Aristotelian
schema of substance and accident.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more specific argument
against the inherence of hyletic data in consciousness is drawn from Husserl's
observation that the hyletic data are not perceived in the actual perceptual
process but become accessible only through reflection, thereby undergoing
'essential changes' (205). (Once more Husserl claims a sort of identity,
notwithstanding an essential or radical difference, a confusion which seems
to be indispensable to his idealism.)</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">To this Daubert objects
that it is false phenomenology to suppose that hyletic data are seized
upon by reflective acts, for the latter 'always seize only entities which
are already formed and grasped' (135v). 'Hyletic data cannot be grasped
and interpreted, for in that case they would be object-like and not at
all hyletic data lacking in intentional unity' (12r: the reference is to
<i>Ideas</i>
I, 88).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert does not however
simply reject the notion of hyletic data. He integrates a revised version
of it into his own phenomenology. This is possible precisely because consciousness
in his view can never become 'pure' in Husserl's reductive sense of this
term. Consciousness is always and inevitably<i> in confrontation with things.</i>
'Nowhere does one come upon it in its pure form, but always as entangled
with a stuff which does not originate in it' (7v). Hyletic data, for Daubert,
are therefore located 'in the transcendent sphere of objects' (12r). The
ultimate guiding and impelling force underlying the cognitive process is
thus to be sought in reality itself.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert agrees with
Husserl that hyletic data are not originally contents of perception, that
they require a special sort of reflection if they are to be brought to
awareness. For Daubert, however, this reflection is simply a process of
delineation: hyletic data become thematic through a reflection which singles
them out from the field of givenness by severing their interwovenness with
the surrounding sensory field. They are 'abstractions from genuine givenness'
(73v), moments thrown into relief by being considered apart from their
context:</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Hyletic data are not
themselves something given... They can be abstracted only as component
parts of a givenness which always contains other <i>Formelemente</i> too
(135v).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert explains this
by reference to 'the purely visual or purely optical make-up of my momentarily
given section of the world' (135v). The latter is organised in a two-fold
manner: 'it has one dimension of forms and figures in themselves, e.g.
the form of a red surface' -- these are the hyletic data, as Daubert conceives
them. And it has 'another dimension derived from figures like things or
their visual appearances' -- the things and aspects in whose orbit the
hyletic data are located (135v).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">There is a proliferation
of terminology here and it will be of some help if we try to sort out,
provisionally, how the terms 'noema', 'aspect', etc. are to be understood
in Daubert's text. The 'noesis/noema' vocabulary is of course taken over
by Daubert from <i>Ideas</i> I itself: as was already made clear above,
the noema is the sense with which the object is grasped, it is the <i>Auffassungssinn</i>
or <i>Gegenstandsauffassung</i> (79v, 147r), 'the object in the manner
of its determinations' (<i>im Wie seiner Bestimmtheit</i>) (114v), 'containing
within itself everything which we are conscious of in the object' (142r).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">'Adumbration' ('<i>Abschattung</i>',
'foreshortening') is another term taken over by Daubert from Husserl. An
object is given in sensory experience always from this or that side, in
this or that particular way, that is, it is never given as a whole but
always in adumbrations: 'Things are not adumbrated in data of sensation,
but always only in modes of appearance and in aspects' (12r). Or again:
'The object can appear [only] in this and in this way. Objective appearance
is bound e.g. to the laws of perspective' (75v). Daubert goes out of his
way to stress that adumbrations are not components of acts (7v). Adumbrations
and appearances depend upon both subject and object, or rather they result
from the interplay between the relative positions of things (bodies), both
perceived and perceiving.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Thus when Husserl asserted
that 'a mental process is not adumbrated' (77), that is to say not given
from this or that point of view, as transcendent objects necessarily are,
he could take this as implying the dependence of real objects on consciousness.
Daubert however draws an opposite conclusion, for 'if adumbrations are
not component parts of acts, then neither is nature relative to con sciousness
because of its adumbrations' (7v). Adumbrations depend on the actual presence
of a cognising subject in a field of objects; they do not depend on consciousness.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 6. The Roots of Consciousness</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Perception proceeds via perspectival and
other foreshortenings, which spring from variations in the relative positions
of real perceivers and real things. It thus reflects both the fact that
the perceiver is aware of his own position vis--vis other bodies and also
the fact that he behaves in certain ways in relation to these other bodies:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The experience of what is physical
and of what is spatial cannot simply be gathered from any intuition whatsoever;
it originates from a primordial [<i>quellhaft</i>] experience of my own
body which moves in space and which does so while already in action and
interaction with other bodies in space (35v).<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">We might say that consciousness arises where
bodily movement becomes structured in a way that allows for guided orientation
of motions in relation to other objects in the world. Consciousness is
not a real annex to bodies, not a reality superadded to perceiving or perceived
real things, it is a relational structure obtaining where animate bodies
and things in the world come into contact with each other in specific sorts
of ways.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consciousness can never
get outside of itself in order to become aware of itself as some other
real thing. But by virtue of its glancing function [<i>Blickfunktion</i>]
it can get outside of itself in the sense that it can become directed towards
other things in the manner of regarding (143r).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Or, as Daubert elsewhere
puts it: 'I do not know about mental processes involved in the act of seeing;
I only know the objects toward which I turn' (33v). From this it follows
however that there is no room for any disproportion between acquaintance
and the thing one is acquainted with: the behavioural familiarity one has
with a real thing cannot somehow be severed from this thing in order to
be compared with and measured by it. The direct awareness we have of things
in reality in virtue of this behavioural familiarity is as it were perfectly
adapted to the grasping of real existence -- and we can now say that it
is precisely this which is the original way of functioning of consciousness.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">An important consequence,
however, is that, as soon as consciousness turns toward itself in an attitude
of reflection, it will tend ineluctably to bestow this same sort of existence
-- illegitimately -- upon <i>itself</i>, to conceive itself by analogy
with a real thing. It is this natural tendency toward substantialisation
which brings about the pseudo-constitution of consciousness as a special
kind of object -- and then it is ironical that this, at least according
to Daubert, is the
<i>only</i> type of 'constitution' consciousness is
capable of.<sup>26</sup> It opens up on the side of the subject a sphere
of semblance -- so that Husserl, in Daubert's view, is correct when he
states that '"fiction" makes up the vital element of phenomenology' (132)
-- i.e. of that sort of phenomenology that is firmly wedded to the reflective
attitude. One could even conclude that, if there exists in the natural
attitude something which bars the way to our understanding of consciousness
and therefore needs to be radically altered, it is not the directedness
of consciousness towards reality, as Husserl affirms (37), but rather this
substantialisation of consciousness itself. And it is the latter, according
to Daubert, on which a reduction ought to be performed.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Husserl did not see
through this natural tendency to posit consciousness as a real existent,
but blindly trusted the reliability of reflection and immanent perception,
not seeing that, when I turn to grasp my immanent experience, the latter
'is not preserved in its original form. The thematising turn does damage
to that which is immanent to a greater extent than is the case in relation
to external perception'. (121v)</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">'One thing alone is
certain: the real being of my acts... But this certainty is guaranteed
not through any pure content of consciousness, but rather through the evidence
of experience' (<i>loc.cit</i>). The act has, thanks to its object, a concrete,
ostensive certainty, where that which is supposed to be the uniquely certain
starting point for Husserl, pure consciousness, 'is entirely in the air;
it has from within itself no access to reality, neither immanent nor transcendent.'
(<i>loc.cit</i>)</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daubert is thus insisting
that Husserl has things precisely the wrong way round: plain and immediate
givenness is attainable only in relation to external reality; internal
perception necessarily involves a gap between consciousness and its object,
a gap which is closed by means of a spurious substantialisation. And where
Husserl conceives the mental process to be 'given as absolute in a simple
seeing (and not in modes of appearance)', Daubert holds that, 'to speak
properly, in immanent perception there exists no simple seeing at all'
(8v; the reference is to <i>Ideas</i> I, 81f.)</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">It is interesting that
Daubert addresses this objection not only to Husserl but also to Heidegger,
whose notion of <i>Dasein</i> is criticised because it reveals that Heidegger,
too, as Daubert reads him, has succumbed 'to the temptation to find here
a being which has its existence in the consciousness of itself' (16v).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 7. The Phenomenology of Reflective
Consciousness</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Both Husserl and Heidegger are as it were
enchanted by consciousness. They ascribe to it the power to 'reach into
the unlimited' (49), be it into its own infinite depths or out into 'infinite
horizons' of the surrounding world.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daubert emphatically
rejects this Cartesian belief in a type of consciousness that would positively
touch infinity:<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup></font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The problem is not: How do I get
from (pure) consciousness to reality? but: How is ideality embedded in
reality, and how is my <i>theoretical</i> looking and thinking embedded
in <i>real</i> consciousness, which is a multifarious encounter with what
is real (19r, our emphasis).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Husserl had maintained that there was an abyss
between two kinds of being: immanent or transcendental being on the one
hand and transcendent being on the other (93; 142). For Daubert, in contrast,
'the difference between consciousness and being, this abyss, lies in something
entirely different from what Husserl thinks' (11v). Underlying Husserl's
account of intentionality is a conception of the totality of what exists
as dismembered into two separate or at least separable <i>pieces</i>, in
opposition to each other. His job as he conceives it is to find some way
of putting these two pieces back together at whatever cost. And the best
he can do, given his starting point, is to salvage the one-sided dependence
of an emasculated 'reality' on the residuum of an 'absolute consciousness'
(91). For Daubert, on the other hand, being is not at war with itself.
Disunion is possible only within the sphere of consciousness, for only
there is there room for negation, cancellation, contradiction and antithetical
phenomena in general: the world of reality is entirely positive (an idea
which sparked a series of important investigations of the logic and ontology
of the negative judgment by the members of the Munich school).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one is to stick
to the Husserlian conception of intentionality, this will give rise, Daubert
says, to a two-fold enigma:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">1. How can the object be seized
upon at all in any particular grasping?</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. How can one be conscious of the object
even when the latter is in no way present? A thing <u>is</u> something
spatially real. It is also, as something real, in every sense of the term
transcendent to consciousness. Consciousness is ego-act [<i>Ichakt</i>]
and it exists now. The object does not enter into this existence; perhaps
it does not even exist at all. (6v; the reference is to <i>Ideas</i> I,
160)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">A further, related passage brings out the
implications of the second enigma:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">[Suppose] an object is intended,
something existing after the manner of a physical thing but which does
not exist any more. It is meant as a physical thing and as existing, but
here the physical reality and existence is not itself present. The two
enigmas of consciousness -- that something can be [an object of] consciousness
without being present in any way whatsoever, and that an object can be
grasped as having this or that form -- imply that consciousness is not
a relation of any sort between the object and the subject, because [in
the given case] the object...is not present. The ego of consciousness is
present, the object is not. For this reason the analysis of consciousness
cannot start out from the statement: consciousness is related to an object.
(150v).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">A type of consciousness which is conceived
as a substance related to other substances runs into the difficulty that,
in the end, it cannot fulfil its aspirations to reach reality except at
the cost of the latter, which comes to be reduced to an 'intentional inexistence'
(150v),<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup> everything becomes a mere 'object
of consciousness'. The real world itself is 'represented in the framework
of...consciousness by corresponding senses or posits' (278). Reality is
thus given to the isolated Husserlian subject, at best, by way of representations,
and hence this subject cannot establish any difference between 'real reality'
and reality as fiction or as dream.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Husserl nowhere really
discusses the Cartesian hypothesis that our experience of reality might
amount to no more than a dream, notwithstanding his strong sympathy for
Descartes' <i>Meditations</i>. He does at one point define an ego of the
intentional sort as 'a "waking" ego' (63), but then his main concern is
expressed in the question: 'How does, and how can, consciousness itself
become separated out [of this wakeful life] as a concrete being in itself?'
(71). The dream hypothesis is important because, as Daubert points out,
our experience of waking up from dreams can be used to bring out precisely
what is essential to our experience of real reality:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">In dreaming the world as a whole
is present, and so am I in it. It is also given 'as something really existing.'
The 'as really existing' is not a real existence, however, but a neutralisation
which immediately becomes evident as soon as the dream is superseded by
actual and wakeful life. In dreaming, givenness is modified, is not in
fact genuine. In this world our beliefs in reality [<i>F&uuml;rwirklichhaltungen</i>]
look exactly like those in wakeful life. But these beliefs in reality,
together with their positings, lack genuine perceivability, i.e. the possibility
of encounter, because that which makes the actual encounter possible is
asleep, or rather is present only after the manner of the dream and in
a dream modification (19v).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Husserl stated that neutralisation is 'closely
akin to reduction' (258), though in a note in one of his personal copies
of <i>Ideas</i> I, he later retracted this statement. If, with Daubert,
one characterises dreaming as a neutralisation, then the phantasmagoria
of a dream disclose basically the same world as does a transcendental reduction,
i.e. the real world as <i>modified</i> in a certain way. In the reduced
world, according to Husserl, 'everything remains as it was before' (183);
even the beliefs produced in it 'look exactly like those in wakeful life'
(19v), as Daubert says. But with this Daubert undermines Husserl's thesis
that to belief-certainty, i.e. to 'the primal form of believing,' there
corresponds 'the characteristic of being <i>simpliciter</i>' (215). Such
a parallelism, even if it obtains, is of no avail for securing the claims
of cognition to grasp reality: this primal form of believing might occur
also in a dream.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 8. Direct Awareness and Cognition</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">The original mode of consciousness, that
mode in which reality is first disclosed, is called by Daubert <i>Innesein</i>.
This direct awareness both underlies perception (provides its foundation),
and furnishes the feature which distinguishes it from experiences that
are subjected to the neutrality modification. The 'immediate access' to
reality granted by <i>Innesein</i> gives 'immediate evidence' of the world
(11v) and produces 'immediate certainty' (1r). It contains 'an absolutely
certain awareness' not only of my own real existence (121v) but also of
'externally perceived reality in its being (its reality)' (1r).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is this direct awareness
which is the clue we have been looking for to reality, to the 'being in
itself' (10v) which underlies all things, aspects and modes of appearance.
The source of this awareness was said to lie in the structures of bodily
movement. Its nature and effects still need to be described. Direct awareness
is a pre-cognitive mode of experience. As we shall see, it is in a certain
sense prior to the dualism of subject and object and it precedes differentiation
and negation. 'The immediate access to reality is not reached through judgments
or positings' (11v). So it nowhere transcends itself, but nor does it ever
fall short of itself. And the priority of direct awareness will yield for
Daubert a decisive argument against Husserl's idealism: awareness is 'the
point where a participation in reality takes place' (16v). It is located
in the active insertion of the animate organism in the environing context
of reality.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Daubert opposes direct
awareness to cognition proper, holding that Husserl's treatment of experience
is restricted to the latter. 'The fundamental experience is not yet a "cognition-of"'
(19v). It precedes the intentional type of consciousness, i.e. cognition's
seizing upon something, which was the point of departure taken by Husserl.
It is a mark of intentional consciousness, according to Daubert, that it
is always transformable into a reflection upon itself (consciousness of
consciousness of something; cf. 206); on the other hand 'my own reality,
of which I am aware, and with evidence, eludes the reflective regard' (41r).</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">Intentional, cognitive
experience, with its positing and sense- conferring capacities, its capacity
to order reality under concepts, is of a higher order: its posits are,
to borrow a phrase from Kant, planted on the 'fertile bathos' of awareness.
But the distance between intentional consciousness and reality implies
that it is necessary 'to distinguish the final validity or invalidity of
rational positing from the peculiar being of the real thing which is in
itself definitive and transcendent' (6r). This means that 'one could concede
to Husserl all the relativity of cognition, but not a relativity of reality'
(41r). Positing a thing as thus-and-so always leaves open the possibility
of grasping that same thing in other respects, leaves room for reinterpretation,
error, doubt and other invalidating experiences of the sort which Husserl
adduced in order to corroborate his doctrine of the absolute character
of consciousness. But now it is a second mark of the direct awareness of
reality that it has no such degrees of freedom. Thus Husserl's argument
to the effect that, where one thing can turn out to be a hallucination,
nothing will be safe against this possibility (54f., 86), is countered
by Daubert with the thesis -- since familiar from the work of Merleau-Ponty,
Wittgenstein and Austin -- that doubt, error, hallucination and so on make
sense only when seen against the general background of the awareness of
reality: 'Physical reality can never be cancelled by conflicting cognitions.
A single object, it is true, can turn out not to be real, but only with
regard to the standard of reality itself' (35v).<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup>
Otherwise one could not even say that 'this or that is really [<i>in Wirklichkeit</i>]
an illusion' (11v). So, Daubert concludes:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The real world is always only
a single one. An error or incomplete grasping of a thing is not an erroneous
or incomplete thing (126v; cf. LU VI &sect; 10, V &sect; 20).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">But now a reinterpreted concept of the noema
comes into play. Daubert subjects it to a transformation which is similar
to his rethinking of the relationship between immanent and transcendent
being. He starts out from the tenet that:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">All cognitions refer to being
in itself in that they further its becoming unveiled and disclosed. Cognition
of being can be relative, but the in-itself of reality holds out come what
may (9v).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">From this he derives the inadequacy of cognition
-- which is forever capable of improvement -- to the cognised real thing.
The changeability of the sense and content of our acts of cognition contrasts
with the quite different sorts of changes which may take place in the objects
to which these acts refer.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The content in which
the object appears in specific modes of givenness may be called the noema.
'In the noema everything is contained that belongs to our consciousness
of the object at a certain moment' (142r), and in these terms Daubert now
gives his own version of just that difference between noema and object
with which we began:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Consciousness of a thing is not
itself a thing. My house is built by workmen in half a year. Not my consciousness
of the house. My house can burn down, not my consciousness of the house.
I insure my house against fire, not my consciousness of the house. The
house cannot be the <i>x</i> to which an infinite series of determinations
are added. It is not an <i>x</i> that I take to the insurance company,
for then calculations would never come to an end. But [such calculation]
has quite definite limits and [my insurance policy] bears exactly upon
these finite determinations. This, on Husserl's view, would be unintelligible.
I do not insure possibilities of perception, and it is not possibilities
of perception that burn down. (126v)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">One might call this the Argument against Idealism
from the Possibility of Insurance.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The noema, as conceived
by Daubert, may be considered under two aspects. First, it is a <u>meaning
entity</u>, is therefore wholly different in its genus from any object.
It is 'something which functions only in our regard to and in our conception
of the object [<u>ist nur etwas im Blick und Begreifen Funktionierendes</u>]...As
sense it is neither a thing nor a part of a thing, but a matter of consciousness'
(126v). But on the other hand 'it is not a being in consciousness, not
something which I could describe as a descriptive fact of pure consciousness'
(126v). 'I can in no way gather the noematic content from immanent consciousness
as such or from the act, but always only from the transcendent world' (121v).
For the noema originates in the object. It is not some necessary counterpart
of mental processes, but they in turn result from it, or rather from the
aspects which the object offers when someone is perceiving it.<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Husserl the object
when reduced to its noema 'has not lost the least nuance' (183): the content
of both is one and the same. Daubert, in contrast, maintains that the noema
is necessarily less than the object because it is conditioned by the incapacity
of the perceiver to acquire a full grasp of all the object's sides and
properties. A noema is but a noema: not the real thing. It is incomplete
and preliminary and depends on the mutual relation between bodies, i.e.
between perceiver and object perceived.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">&sect; 9. A Role for Reality</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">The true abyss lies in consciousness itself
and not, as Husserl would have it, in a rift between consciousness and
reality as two irreducible types of being. It consists in the heterogeneity
of two sorts of consciousness, <u>direct awareness</u> of what exists,
of reality, on the one hand, and <u>cognition</u>, on the other, cognition
of states of affairs, of essence, of ideality, of objects as falling under
concepts. But if Daubert is to stick to this dualism, then will not this,
too, inevitably force him back into just that sort of two worlds theory
which he had set out to overcome?<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup> To
show that it will not, we need to establish precisely how, in Daubert's
framework, the 'reality' that is given in direct awareness stands in relation
to the objects given in perceptual and other cognitive acts.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have seen, Daubert
wants to insist upon the omnipresence of reality in all (even erroneous)
cognition of objects. The direct awareness of reality is implied as the
foundation of intentional acts of all modes and types, even in the most
basic acts of perception. Thus if Daubert acknowledges the primacy of perception,
what he has in mind is a relative primacy, which holds only in the sphere
of intentionality. 'What is, properly speaking, originally given in perception?
Only this: that through perception reality is <u>more</u> immediately accessible
than in meaning or in representation' (9r, our emphasis). In contrast to
this, the immediate awareness of reality is a 'special component' in all
modes of consciousness (16r), be it perception, imagination, memory or
what have you. Direct awareness, 'this most original way of experiencing
the world, precedes every consciousness and all [conceptual] grasping'
(35v). 'It must be made crystal-clear that reality is not a character of
perception but something which remains stable throughout perception and
indeed belongs to the thing' (9r). Reality is given not in peception but
in the direct awareness on which it rests.</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Do I <u>perceive</u> reality or
do I <u>experience</u> it? I experience that [the object] really exists.
I do not perceive its reality, it becomes manifest to me. I can only perceive
something which really exists and the reality of which is manifest to me
(9v, our emphasis).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Reality is thus the stable core in all variegations
of cognition,<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup> and the various modes
of consciousness are classifiable according to their degree of proximity
to this core as it is disclosed in direct awareness.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it might be supposed
that Daubert's 'direct awareness of reality' has become so tenuous and
so all-pervasive that it has ceased to do any work within the theory, and
that 'reality', correlatively, has receded to the status of a mere thing
in itself. It is in avoiding this Kantian conclusion that there lies the
true originality of Daubert's position. The reality that is given in direct
awareness -- the 'phenomenon' -- is not an unknown <i>x</i>, but nor is
it articulated into concepts or states of affairs or intentional objects.
It manifests itself, rather, as something that is authoritative [<u>das
Ma&szlig;gebende</u>], as a <u>standard</u> or <u>measure</u> for cognition.
Objects are given 'in the act and the noema as a standard [<u>ma&szlig;gebend</u>]
and independent [<u>eigenm&auml;chtig</u>] with regard to the act in question'
(142r). Cognition, indeed, is seen to take the form of an effort to approximate
to this pre-given standard -- and in this lies the germ of Daubert's realist
theory of truth.<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup></font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">The being of the object should
be authoritative</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. for its so-being as state of affairs</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. for its make-up in perception</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3. for the correctness of the judgment,
etc.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What is not authoritative however is consciousness
of it, i.e. nothing in the act. But the being of the object is itself [something
of which I am] conscious, otherwise it could not in turn be authoritative
for me. But it has thereby a quite other intentional position than consciousness
itself, with all that is within the latter that refers to the object. (118v)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The object in reality 'assigns certain limits'
to our freedom of grasping it in judgments or in concepts (138v), and it
is these limits or boundary conditions which are made manifest in experiences
of direct awareness. 'I experience the autonomy [<u>Selbstherrlichkeit</u>]
with which [the real object] accepts one determination and rejects another'
(140r). The possibility of illusion displays the freedom of consciousness
to make mistaken determinations of perceived things. But it thereby presupposes
that the latter have real determinations which one can, or cannot, grasp.
'Without this persistent element no correction would be possible' (8r).
Therefore the real thing with its determinations will remain forever the
authoritative 'criterion' of cognition (132v).</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this point Daubert
opposes both the later Husserl and Neo- Kantianism. Both come close to
the idealistic 'dissolution' of the world described by Windelband. Both
fail to do justice to the autonomy of the object, either by reducing it
to something merely posited or by equating it with an unknown and unknowable
<i>x</i>.
And now Daubert with his notion of <u>das Ma&szlig;gebende</u> is in a
position to strengthen his argument against the Husserlian idea of constitution.
'The existence of what is pre-given does not dissolve into the existence
of beliefs about it' (19v). Even were an object to be adequately given
in some sequence of acts it would remain impossible to identify what is
thereby given with any structure of associated noemata, for this would
be to leave out all that is contributed by the object in direct awareness
-- and it is this which guides and constrains the structure of perception.'It
pertains to the sense of all sense-bestowal and to all positing that it
cannot bestow and posit the standard-giving being [<u>das ma&szlig;gebende
Sein</u>], but always only a content of cognition which refers to it' (39v).
All noemata, however much they may conform to the object in reality, are
seen to float arbitrarily in the air when they are conceived in isolation
from the reality which constrains the experiences of direct awareness on
which they rest.</font>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<font face="Times New Roman">he standard-giving
dimension in reality, direct or bodily awareness and cognitive or intentional
experience are not three separate realms. They mutually interpenetrate:
that which is given in direct awareness is reality taken in its function
as <u>something there to be intended in cognition</u>. Hence just as consciousness
is nothing existing in itself, so also the real thing is not locked up
in itself and beyond the reach of cognition:</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something is authoritative
not insofar as it exists ontologically in itself, but insofar as it stands
in a certain relation to cognition. But this is not a relation between
something existing in itself and a cognising subject. Everything possible
may be authoritative insofar as it becomes an object of cognition. But
its own peculiar being -- as opposed to the erroneous grasping of it --
is fixed, and it is properly speaking in this that transcendence in cognition
consists. (102v)</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can now see precisely
what is wrong with both the Husserlian conception of transcendence in terms
of constitution (a transcendence that 'is entirely referred to consciousness':
92) and the Neo-Kantian conception of transcendence as an unknown <i>x</i>.
Both suffer from the fact that the transcendent thing has been rendered
powerless, has been precisely <i>neutralised</i>. For Daubert, on the other
hand, the transcendent thing is continually at work as something which
sets limits to cognition.<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup></font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">That which is authoritative never
comes to the fore as such except when I focus upon it, and then it is 'fixed
by the sense of my cognition' (9r). Direct awareness is a pre-cognitive
relation to the things making up reality, not a cognitive awareness of
that in them which is <i>ma&szlig;gebend</i>. The conceptual fixation of
reality should not however be misunderstood as a matter of arbitrary or
spontaneous decision. The concepts I use to describe reality are limited
on the one hand by the authority of reality itself, and on the other hand
by my own practical interests as an animate organism, interests which are
not 'directed indeterminately but always towards some object' (35r). Thanks
to practical handling things are disclosed 'in their positions within my
various spheres of interest' (61v).<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup></font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">Although Daubert's description of interest,
his rooting of cognition in action, remains sketchy, it nevertheless serves
his purpose in his criticism of Husserl's idea of a 'transcendental reduction'.
If to have an interest implies a direction towards an object, then any
suspension of features of the object presupposes an inhibition of an interest
turned towards it. Husserl's suspension of the positing of reality is therefore
interpreted by Daubert as 'the suspension of the interest which bears upon
reality'. Now Daubert accepts that 'this suspension is possible, and it
is the only way of grasping the essence of an object' (61v). Reality can
be parenthesised by withdrawing one's interest in a given individual thing
as individual thing, i.e. as part and parcel of this directly experienced
reality, and by focussing instead on the thing as instance of a type. But
this <i>eidetic</i> reduction of concrete objects -- the only reduction
whose meaningfulness Daubert will acknowledge -- leaves behind essences
which, although 'in them I have indeed parenthesised reality' (83r), still
refer to those same concrete objects as their foundation and as the source
of their legitimation. Therefore the interest in reality survives, albeit
in a modified form, and indeed survives as the very support of such a reduction.
But Husserl, in his so-called transcendental reduction, wants to sever
<i>all</i>
ties with reality by substituting acts of reflection for straightforward
ones, as if it were possible to bid farewell to the direct awareness of
reality. And because this direct awareness 'cannot enter with the rest
into the epoch&eacute;' (83v), Husserlian phenomenology not only retreats
from reality, it bars to itself the very possibility of an access to it.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus Daubert gives
the following final judgment:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">If this reality is forgotten,<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup>
then the whole connection of individual things is transposed into a sphere
of dreams, or better into a neutralised sphere to which then not just the
single thing but reality as a whole is banished. (83r)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">In <i>Ideas</i> I, Husserl had affirmed that
'for a phenomenology of "true reality" <i>the phenomenology of "void seeming"</i>
[<i>Ph&auml;nomenologie des nichtigen Scheins</i>] is also wholly indispensable'
(318). A phenomenology of 'void seeming', of a neutralised reality: if
this is indeed, as Daubert has tried to show, the true predicament of Husserl's
phenomenology in <i>Ideas</i> I, then Daubert's phenomenology, in opposition
to that of Husserl, may by rights claim to contain what the early phenomenologists
so often aspired to, namely a phenomenology of real reality ['<i>wirkliche
Wirklichkeit</i>'].</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase 'real reality'
occurs already in a Logic lecture given by Theodor Lipps, grandfather of
Munich phenomenology, in 1899.<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup> Daubert
then uses it in a manuscript written in preparation for his discussions
with Husserl on Jan. 18, 1904<sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup> and it
also occurs in one of Husserl's Seefeld manuscripts, i.e. in a text written
in August or September 1905 during his stay at Seefeld (Tyrol), where he
spent weeks of intensive discussions with both Pf&auml;nder and Daubert.<sup><a href="#N_39_">(39)</a></sup>
The pre-occupation with the problem of 'real reality' is a lasting feature
of Daubert's thinking. His first major project, a doctoral dissertation
under Lipps planned as early as 1899, was on the consciousness of reality.
This plan was abortive, like all his other literary projects, but the idea
continued to play a role in his analyses of impersonal sentences, existential
judgments, of the formal ontology of objects and states of affairs and
of the logic of questions. It also forms the background for his project
of a phenomenology of evidence, to which File A I 3, Daubert's last manuscript,
is devoted.</font>

addition to the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung for the award to Smith

<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a>2. H. Spiegelberg, <i>The Phenomenological Movement</i>,
p.169. This phrase echoes an earlier remark by Moritz Geiger to the effect
that, whilst Daubert had contributed more than anyone else to making known
the ideas of Husserl's <i>Logical Investigations</i>, he had done so 'ohne
je eine Zeile geschrieben zu haben' (1933, p.4).
<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a>3. Daubert's own records of many of these discussions
have fortunately survived and those of Daubert's manuscripts relating specifically
to the <i>Logical Investigations</i> are to appear shortly in a volume
in the Nijhoff series <i>Primary Sources in Phenomenology</i>.
<p><a NAME="N_4_"></a>4. Introduction to <i>Alciphron</i>. Or, as Husserl
wrote to Daubert in a letter of Dec. 22, 1923 which it would be too painful
to translate:
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">F&uuml;r mich sind Sie semper idem,
durch und durch Philosoph ("wesensm&auml;&szlig;ig"), und wenn Sie sich
als Landwirt wohl f&uuml;hlen, so ist es zweifellos recht, weil es philosophisch
echt ist.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_5_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">5. See Av&eacute;-Lallemant
1975, pp</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_6_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">6. In a draft of
a letter to Husserl of June 26, 1913 Daubert says: 'You deal in the <i>Ideas</i>
in a grand manner with precisely those questions with which I have been
occupied in my work of the last years... There are differences, to be sure,
but they are surely inessential.' On Pf&auml;nder's sympathetic reactions
to <i>Ideas</i> I see Schuhmann, <i>Husserl &uuml;ber Pf&auml;nder</i>,
pp.6f.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_7_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">7. See also Husserl's
amazed reaction in a postcard of March 16, 1915 addressed to Daubert at
the front: 'Meine "Ideen" bei Ihnen im Felde? Sie bringen es zu Stande,
<i>diese</i>
Wirklichkeit "einzuklammern"?'</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_8_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">8. It will be necessary
to quote extensively from this file, which is not merely still unpublished,
but has not even been fully transcribed. Quotations will be given by referring
to page number with recto/verso markings (e.g. 52r or 52v) of the folios

necessary, though we do not follow it in all details. It should be noted
in particular that we use 'reality' -- and not 'actuality' -- as our rendering
of Daubert's and Husserl's '<i>Wirklichkeit</i>'.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_9_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">9. Among Husserl's
own works the <i>Logical Investigations</i> and the then still recent <i>Nachwort</i>
to <i>Ideas</i> I receive only minor attention in Daubert's manuscript.
<i>Formal
and Transcendental Logic</i> (1929) is extensively discussed and Daubert
in addition uses E. Fink's "Vergegenw&auml;rtigung und Bild" as a guide
to Husserl's most recent position.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_10_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">10. The distinction
advanced by Husserl between the sense of a perception and its object occurs
already in the doctoral dissertation of Aloys Hompf, who like Daubert was
a student of Theodor Lipps in Munich. Hompf introduces it by means of a
strikingly similar example:</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">The object 'house' can collapse, catch
fire, be sold or be declared uninhabitable. But it would of course be ridiculous
and devoid of sense to apply these or similar predicates to the content
of my perception of the house. (<i>Untersuchungen &uuml;ber symbolische
Relationen</i>, 1905, p.39.)</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">Compare also the following passage
from Brentano's <i>Vom Dasein Gottes </i>(p. 116): No window is going to
allow itself to be broken with a presented stone. Phenomena do not fall,
and they do not enter into chemical combinations, either.'</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_11_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">11. Here we follow
Husserl in equating 'noema' and '[<i>erweiterte/extendierte</i>] <i>Sinn</i>'
(182). Considerations of the sort which underlie the more technical distinction
between '<i>Sinn</i>' and 'full noema' (185) will not play a role in the
arguments which follow.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_12_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">12. In his last
period Husserl was to concede that our everyday life- world is 'the only
real world, the only one that...is ever experienced and experienceable'
(<i>The Crisis of European Sciences</i>, p.49). Even so, he still defended
his statement about the tree-noema which cannot burn (cf. <i>Crisis</i>,
&sect; 70).</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_13_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">13. There are,
certainly, passages in Husserl's text which seem to suggest that he, too,
rejected the two-world theory (see e.g. &sect; 49 last sentence, &sect;
&sect; 88, 90). These statements are valid, however, only within the framework
of the phenomenological reduction, and to the extent that there is a distinction
between the reduced and the natural attitude, there is a difference also
on the side of the objects.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_14_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">14. Such a conception
may be of some use if we abandon the strictly phenomenological perspective
and attempt to understand the structures involved when a perceiving organism
is related to an object in a perceptual act. See Smith 1984, for a defence
of what is in effect an Aristotelian theory of the subject-act relation
along these lines, having consequences very similar to those of Daubert's
theory.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_15_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">15. Already in
an article of 1904 William James had put forward a similar thesis, and
the following remark, at least when torn from its context, reminds one
completely of Daubert:</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">I mean only to deny that the word
['consciousness'] stands for an entity, but to insist most emphatically
that it does stand for a function (p.3).</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">Both James' and Daubert's views may
have been developed independently out of Carl Stumpf's notion of '<i>psychische
Funktion</i>'. James' article, by the way, also contains a spirited illustration
of the difference between physical and mental states which reminds one,
again, of Hompf's 'house', already mentioned above. Consider a room in
a house:</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">As a <i>room</i> it will take an earthquake
or a gang of men to destroy it. As a <i>subjective state</i> the closing
of your eyes, or any instantaneous play of your fancy will suffice. In
the real world, fire will consume it. In your mind, you can let fire play
over it without effect. As an outer object, you must pay so much a month
to inhabit it. As an inner content, you may occupy it for any length of
time rent-free (<i>op.cit.</i>, p.14, our emphasis)</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_16_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">16. The device
of thematisation Daubert here takes over from Gurwitsch.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_17_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">17. &sect;&sect;
9, 11. A short summary is given also in <i>Ideas</i> I, &sect; 126. See
also Reinach 1911, &sect; 15 of translation.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_18_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">18. This criticism
in a way repeats Kant's criticism in the first <i>Critique</i> of the paralogisms
of Wolffian psychology.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">19. While the
term 'Bewu&szlig;tsein' goes back to Wolff (1719), the English term first
became prominent in an anonymous treatise <i>On Consciousness</i> of 1728,
though it had been used already e.g. in Locke's <i>Essay</i>.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_20_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">20. Daubert detects
in this argument a fallacious transition from essence to existence. And
once again there is a Kantian connection: his criticism can be said to
be a reformulation of Kant's well-known refutation of the (Wolffian) ontological
argument.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_21_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">21. <i>Geschichte
der Philosophie</i>, p.463n. (Daubert quotes Windelband at A I 3/74r.)</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_22_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">22. The wording
of this phrase is strangely reminiscent of Husserl's later statement that
the 'interrelation between reason and what is' is 'the enigma of all enigmas'
(<i>Crisis</i>, &sect; 5).</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_23_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">23. At the time,
Daubert could not know how correct he was in applying Windelband's formula
to Husserl. In a manuscript from September 1908 which Husserl entitled
"Die Aufl&ouml;sung des empirischen Seins in Zusammenh&auml;nge des absoluten
Bewu&szlig;tseins" (cf. Schuhmann, <i>Husserl- Chronik</i>, p.119) and
also "Sein der Natur sich 'aufl&ouml;send' in Bewu&szlig;tsein" (MS B II
1, cover), he says:</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">And insofar as it belongs to the immanent
essence of such connections of consciousness that in them the 'object'
is thought, posited, is ultimately determined in a valid way and known,
objective being 'dissolves itself' [<i>'l&ouml;st sich ... auf'</i>] into
connections of consciousness. (MS K II 1/12; quoted by G. Patzig 1971,
p.31, n.13.)</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">Walter Biemel, who quotes this formulation
as Husserl's own (Husserliana II, "Einleitung des Herausgebers", p.VIII),
is unaware of its Windelbandian origins, though Husserl's quotation marks
around "aufl&ouml;send" and "l&ouml;st sich auf" are sufficient evidence
that he is indeed quoting Windelband. The same allusion seems to be present
also when he states: 'Everything that is offered to us by the sciences
in regard to the <i>onta</i> "dissolves itself into what is phenomenological"'
["<i>l&ouml;st sich in Ph&auml;nomenologisches auf</i>"]. (Husserliana
V, p.78.) This could be one more hint as to the rather traditional character
of Husserl's idealism.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_24_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">24. This formulation
occurs already in a manuscript of 1909 (Husserliana XXIII, p.265), though
there is not yet sufficient evidence for the claim that this occurrence
spells a fundamental revision of Husserl's doctrine of consciousness, as
is claimed by E. Marbach, "Einleitung", <i>op.cit</i>., p. LXIIf.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_25_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">25. Daubert's
analysis here could be compared first of all to that of Merleau-Ponty:</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">L'exp&eacute;rience motrice de notre
corps...nous fournit une manire d'acc&eacute;der au monde et &agrave; l'objet,
une 'praktognosie' qui doit &ecirc;tre reconnue comme originale .... (<i>Ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nologie
de la perception</i>, p.164.)</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">There are important parallels also
to Gibson's ecological theory of perception (see e.g. Glotzbach and Heff,
1982). But the most detailed recent philosophical analysis of these problems,
whose anti- egological stance is in many respects congenial to what Daubert
has in mind, is to be found in Harald Delius' book <i>Self-Awareness</i>,
especially in his treatment of how a child learns to use the words "I see":</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">The general behavioural pattern that
comes to be associated with "seeing" will contain as an outstanding feature
that the person (or animal) which is said to "now see something",...by
movements of reaching for something or pointing at something, etc., <i>puts
himself into a relation towards something</i> located at some definite
spot in the space surrounding him. And the "I" as used, for instance, by
the person exclaiming "Now I see it!" is taken, by the observer learning
the use of these words, to somehow stand for the person (his body and location
in space) who utters that exclamation. (<i>Self-Awareness</i>, p.148)</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">Delius, like Daubert, comes close
to Gurwitsch (whom, however, he does not discuss) when he says that all
of the material or qualitative differences, e.g. between types of perception
like seeing or hearing, 'belong to the <i>contents</i> seen or heard',
and that, when we abstract from the differences between such contents,
seeing or hearing are just predicates describing a <i>relation</i> beween
different sense-organs and different types of contents (cf. <i>op.cit</i>.,
p.149: As Daubert puts it at 138v: 'The seeing of a tree and the seeing
of a house are, as seeings, not distinguished.')</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">As for Daubert, so also for Delius,
we have no direct knowledge of the ego: 'Our knowlege of the existence
of this unknown <i>relatum</i> is essentially mediated by our knowledge
of the existence of the relation.' (<i>op.cit</i>., p.152.) And as Daubert
linked the problem of consciousness to that of syncategorematica, so Delius
shows that the ego-relation to a content cannot be made thematic without
first being formulated in language: states of self-awareness are, he says,
'linguistically dependent states of affairs', i.e. their being is exhausted
in their being expressed.</font></sup>
<p><sup><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand the view, shared
by Daubert and Husserl, that the body is the necessary origin or source
of all cognition, is subjected to attack by Elmar Holenstein in his important
paper "Nullpunkt der Orientierung" of 1972.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_26_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">26. In the second
draft of his <i>Encyclopedia Britannica </i>article, Husserl had acknowledged
that Descartes had already used 'the first radical method of reduction'
(Husserliana IX, p. 264). In this setting he asserts that in performing
the reduction 'I am not a human ego.' (<i>Op.cit</i>, p. 275) Heidegger
commented on this passage: 'Or maybe I am one precisely by doing so', (<i>op.cit</i>.,
p. 275, fn. 1). The ability to carry out the transcendental reduction was
for Heidegger a 'central possibility of the existing factual self'. (<i>Op.cit</i>,
p. 601f.) Thus he, too, could come under Daubert's attack because he still
upholds the Cartesian-Husserlian belief in the 'wonderful' power of consciousness.
(<i>op.cit</i>., p. 275, fn.1)</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_27_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">27. Cf. the allusion
to Brentano in <i>Ideas</i> I, 185f.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_28_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">28. Here again
Daubert's views can be compared with Husserl's own earlier position. See
e.g. Husserliana XVI, pp.290f. Daubert is careful to stress that error
and illusion 'are nothing psychic. They have no being at all in the sense
in which existing objects have being. The being of errors and illusions
lies in a quite different factual sphere (the errors, the possibilities
of thought and perception, the presumptions, the impossibilities, etc.).'

<p><a NAME="N_29_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">29. Husserl had
attempted to come to grips with the same sort of thing in his treatment
of the givenness of a thing 'in person' (283). In the characteristic 'in
person', however, he sees just one more moment or constituent of the noema,
linked to other such moments in a systematic way. This aspect of Husserl's
noema-theory is made particularly clear in Woodruff Smith and McIntyre
1982, esp. ch.VIII: 'Definite, or <u>De Re</u>, Intention in a Husserlian
Framework'.</font></sup>

understanding and grasping of the thing intervenes its appearance. But
the real appearance [consists of:] (a) external constellations, (b) constellations
arising through my relation and position in respect to it.' (126v)</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_31_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">31. A dualism
which would resemble most the Schopenhauerian version of Platonism. Schopenhauer
seems indeed to have exerted a certain influence on Daubert's reflections
on the duplicity of consciousness. He is mentioned at A I 3/74r.</font></sup>

calls this the 'ontic permanence' of reality (<u>Doing Phenomenology</u>,

LU VI &sect; 39.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_34_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">34. For Husserl,
too, there are limits set to cognition, but these are exclusively a matter
of the coherence, of the harmonious regularity, of the flux of experiences.
They are not in any sense limits contributed by the transcendent object.</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_35_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">35. Heidegger's
<i>Sein
und Zeit</i>, with its analysis of the manipulation of <i>Zeug</i>, has
obviously influenced Daubert here. Note, however, that for Daubert, 'My
practical interest (which is the more basic one) and my cognitive interest
<i>do
not constitute anything</i>' (138v, our emphasis).</font></sup>
<p><a NAME="N_36_"></a><sup><font face="Times New Roman">36. Daubert's
German reads: 'Wird diese Wirklichkeit vergessen...' and he clearly alludes
to the Heideggerian notion of <i>Seinsvergessenheit</i> in the opening
sentence of <i>Sein und Zeit</i>. Indeed Daubert's wording suggests that
to him Husserl has missed the most fundamental question of phenomenology.</font></sup>
