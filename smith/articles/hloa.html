<BLOCKQUOTE>The objection that we are attempting here a restitution of
the Aristotelian-scholastic logic, on whose inferior value history has
pronounced judgment, should not perturb us. Perhaps it may yet turn out
that the discipline in question is by no means so narrow in scope and so
poor in profound problems, as it is reproached with being. Perhaps traditional
logic was merely a highly imperfect and dim realization of the idea of
pure logic, but none the less competent and worthy of respect as a first
beginning. (Husserl, "Prolegomena" to the <I>Logical Investigations</I>,

<B>1. Tasks of an Ontology of Language</B>
<P>The term 'ontology' has played a role in recent discussions of language
and linguistics almost exclusively in connection with the problem of the
so-called 'ontological commitments' of a linguistic theory. In the present
paper however the term 'ontology' is used in a way that is at once more
modest and more ambitious. It is more modest, because ontology will be
understood not as a higher-order investigation of certain theories, but
as a discipline having as its subject-matter the objects themselves, which
such theories investigate. It is more ambitious, because it will extend
beyond 'language' as narrowly conceived to include also, for example (in
conformity with an older tradition of universal grammar), the acts and
actions of language-using subjects. Indeed we may say that the ontology
of language is concerned precisely with the relations between uses of language,
both overt and covert, and other entities, whether in the world or in the
mind of the subject.
<P>A first survey of the sorts of relations which might come into question
for such an ontology would include:
<P>(a) relations between a referring use of an expression and its object
(assuming, of course, that it has an object),
<P>(b) relations between the use of a (true) sentence and that in the world
which makes it true,<SUP><A HREF="#2">2</A></SUP>
<P>(c) relations between a used predicate and the object or objects of
which it is predicated, and also, at least in certain cases, between this
object and those of its parts and moments in virtue of which the predicate
holds,
<P>(d) relations among uses of language themselves, for example anaphoric
relations, relations between those events which are referring and predicating
uses of expressions, relations between successive uses of sentences in
higher-order structures such as narratives, arguments, conversations, and
so on.
<P>I shall have something to say about all of these species of examples
in what follows. My main concern, however, will be with the ways in which
uses of language are bound up with mental acts. Thus for example I shall
be concerned with:
<P>(e) relations between mental acts on the one hand and underlying mental
states (attitudes, beliefs), on the other,
<P>(f) relations between my acts and states and those associated uses of
language which are overt actions on my part, for example actions of promising
or of asking questions,
<P>(g) relations between my mental acts and states and the overt actions
(including utterances) of other subjects with whom I come into contact
(relations of understanding, of communication).
<P>It is remarkable how few analytic philosophers have attempted to describe
any of these relations in more than merely metaphorical terms - as if language,
narrowly conceived as a system of abstract types, would exist in splendid
isolation from mental and other sorts of structure. Proponents of causal
and historical theories of names have taken some initial steps in connection
with (a), but their accounts are too narrowly causal, and often little
more than promissory notes. Advocates of the semantics of natural language
have done some work in the areas of (c) and (d), but the analytic philosopher's
understanding of the object-predicate relation has advanced not at all
since Frege conceived his peculiar function-argument interpretation. Moreover,
work on the interrelations between successive uses of language, at least
on the part of the more philosophically minded theorists of language, has
been concentrated overwhelmingly on those cases which can be pressed within
the schemata of one or other orthodox system of logic. Some work, especially
that associated with the names of H. P. Grice and P. F. Strawson, has been
done by analytic philosophers on the interconnections bteween language
and associated mental acts, and proponents of speech act(ion) theory have
made some headway in particular with parts of (f) and (g), but their accounts
do not mesh at all with any worked-out ontology: they resolve into elucidations
of certain logical relations between sentences (promise S is felicitous
if and only if...), and throw little light on how speech act(ions) are
structured in such a way as to be bound up in more complex wholes with
those mental events which are acts and those mental states which are beliefs,
convictions, desires, etc.
<P>There is one philosophical tradition, however, which did concern itself
precisely with the whole range of relations of the given sort. It is the
tradition which began with the work of Brentano and his students, above
all Alexius Meinong (1853-1920), Carl Stumpf (1848-1936) and Anton Marty
(1847-1914), and reached its high-point in the <I>Logical Investigations
</I>of
Edmund Husserl (1858-1938). This tradition was carried forward in philosophy
by the realist phenomenologists such as Johannes Daubert (1877-1947) and
Adolf Reinach (1883-1917) and in linguistics by such thinkers as Roman
Jakobson (1896-1982) and Karl Buehler (1879-1963). The present essay is
a brief survey of the philosophical work on language by the members of
this tradition, together with a comparison of the results of their work
with other, competing approaches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>2. Species and Generality</B>
<P>Of central importance for what follows will be the theory of dependence-relations
set forth, in germ, in Husserl's 3rd Logical Investigation and anticipated
by Franz Brentano (1838-1917) in his lectures of 1887-1891 on descriptive
psychology. (See especially pp. 20-27 and 88-103 of Brentano 1982 and also
Mulligan and Smith 1985 for a discussion in English.) Each of the various
different relations mentioned above can be understood in the terms of this
ontology, in a way that it at once elegant and economical. Before presenting
Husserl's views on dependence, however, it will be useful to make some
more general remarks on the subject of generality, for the opposition between
species and <I>instance</I>, between what is general and what is particular,
will turn out to be fundamental to the entire project of a theory of language
in the Husserlian sense.
<P>Imagine that we are called upon to look at the world as a zoologist,
or a phonologist, or a warehouse manager, or a fingerprint expert might.
We notice very soon that some features of the world are constant, while
others vary. It is important not to import philosophical simplifications
- of either what one might call the Platonistic or the nominalist sort
- into the description of this fact. Constancy occurs not because there
are, in addition to individual realia, abstract essences which somehow
reappear, identically, in different objects. And nor does it occur because
of some not further explicable propensity of subjects to use general terms
in certain ways. Constancy occurs, rather - or at least this is the core
of the Brentano-Husserl view - because objects have real parts or moments
('respects') which stand to each other in relations of <I>perfect similarity</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#3">3</A></SUP>
These may be moments of the most simple sort, for example moments of colour
or taste. (The sentence "Hans's arm is the same colour as Bruno's leg"
is made true by the perfect similarity between the individual colour-moments
inhering in their respective limbs.) Or they may be more complex, higher-order
structures founded upon these. (The sentence 'these two sequences of whistles
are performances/instances of the same melody' is made true by a relation
of perfect similarity between certain Gestalt- qualities inhering in the
respective quantities of sound- material.)
<P>In virtue of such relations of perfect similarity, which may obtain
on different levels, objects are gathered into classes of actual and possible
similars called by Husserl 'species'. Such species are not additional abstract
entities. Rather, talk of species is to be cashed out in terms of relations
of similarity between certain real parts and moments of entities on the
level of what is concrete and contingent.
<P>This deflationary interpretation of Husserl's thinking on species and
generality is controversial. The issue is confused by the fact that one
important aim of the <I>Logical Investigations</I> was to attack psychologism
in logic, and particularly in volume I of the work - the "Prolegomena to
Pure Logic" - where Husserl is concerned to dramatise the inadequacies
of psychologism, he seems to put forward a Platonistic view of the nature
of specie as 'ideal singulars', a view which contrasts, to the same extent,
with the similarity view sketched above. When we look more carefully at
Husserl's <I>use</I> of the species concept in the body of the work, however,
then it becomes clear that his motives for introducing talk of species
are not those of the Platonist. Indeed he pours scorn on Platonism in the
traditional sense - on the view that species are real entities (LU II &sect;
7) - and he spends little time reflecting on species themselves or on their
ontological properties. He is much rather concerned with the <I>instances</I>
of species and with the problem of finding a means of doing justice to
the manifold sorts of constancy or regularity and in the manifold sorts
of law-governed connection that we encounter among such instances, both
in the world and in our mental acts.
<P>Why, then, did Husserl utilise this terminology of species at all? This
was, I think, for two reasons. First, it is the basis of Husserl's theory
of logic (a) that logic is a science having its own specific subject-matter,
and (b) that this subject-matter should not be a matter of empirically
occurring instances but of entities somehow outside the world of what happens
and is the case. Logic is a science of thinkings, inferrings, reasonings
<I>in
specie</I>: it is a science of the relations between species of these given
sorts (see e.g. LU II &sect; 2). Second, it was important to Husserl's
theory that the real relations of similarity do not occur as it were at
random, but that they themselves exhibit a certain order. In particular,
they manifest a hierarchical structure, so that species are included in
other species at higher levels of generality, the corresponding predicates
being organised into trees of determinables and determinates. This is a
property of universals that was taken for granted by logicians of a more
traditional bent from Aristotle and Porphyry to W. E. Johnson.<SUP><A HREF="#4">4</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>3. Husserl's Theory of Dependence and its Linguistic Applications</B>
<P>We are now in a position where we can say something about Husserl's
theory of dependence, which is all of a piece with his theory of species.
For Husserl recognised that there are, in addition to the vertical (inclusion)
relations between species, certain sorts of lateral relations, sharing
with them important modal properties. Examples of the vertical relations
would be:
<P>every instance of the species <I>red</I> is also an instance of the
species <I>colour</I>;
<P>every instance of the species <I>mammal</I> is also an instance of the
species <I>animal</I>;
<P>every instance of the species <I>judgment</I> is also an instance of
the species <I>mental act</I>.
<P>Such relations involve moving from one species to another along given
branches of a single species-tree. They can be more or less satisfactorily
captured by means of the familiar inclusion relation of standard set theory.
Lateral relations, in contrast, involve moving from one branch to another,
or perhaps even moving to a wholly different tree. Such relations, even
when conceived merely extensionally, fall outside standard set theory or
any of its more usual extensions. Examples of such lateral relations are:
<P>no instance of the species <I>funeral</I> occurs, without a prior and
associated instance of the species <I>death</I>;
<P>no instance of the species <I>colour</I> exists, without a simultaneous
and associated instance of the species <I>visual xtension</I>;
<P>no instance of the species <I>phoneme</I> is also an instance of the
species <I>edible thing</I>;
<P>no instance of the species <I>red</I> coincides with (occupies the same
spatio-temporal area as) an instance of the species <I>green</I>.
<P>These relations are, in Husserl's terminology, relations of dependence
and of necessary exclusion or incompatability. Such relations are of course
in a certain sense trivial (no less trivial, indeed, than the vartical
or analytic relations which are captured in the <I>arbor porphyriana</I>
of the traditional sort). This does not mean, however, that they can be
ignored, and nor, either, does it mean that there is not a great advantage
to be derived in embedding them within a theoretical framework within which
their status can be clarified and their character of apparent arbitrariness
removed.<SUP><A HREF="#5">5</A></SUP> The theory of such relations has
indeed been shown, in as yet unpublished work by Kit Fine, to yield a mathematical
framework of some elegance and complexity, though it would take us too
far from our main concerns to develop the details of the theory here.<SUP><A HREF="#6">6</A></SUP>
Suffice it to point out that Husserl distinguishes between one-sided and
reciprocal dependence, e.g. between the one-sided dependence of an instance
of the species <I>musical tone</I> on an instance of the species <I>temporal
duration</I>, and the three-sided mutual dependence of instances of the
species <I>pitch</I>, <I>timbre</I> and <I>loudness</I> within a given
tone.
<P>Such n-fold dependence relations correspond to n-fold dimensions of
variation in the space of objects governed by the relations in question.
Husserl's own 4th Investigation, now, is precisely an application of the
theory of dependence to the relations structuring the space of <I>meaningful
uses of language</I>. Uses of language can be divided, at different levels,
into (relatively) dependent and (relatively) independent, in a way that
can be shown to generate a categorial order of types of such uses (i.e.
of the various 'parts of speech'). Thus Husserl's work on the laws governing
dependent and independent meanings influenced the development of categorial
grammar by Stanisaw Leniewski (1886-1939) and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890-1963)
(see Smith and Mulligan, 1982, &sect; 5.) The idea of a grammatical theory
built up on the basis of a theory of the dependence relations between parts
of sentences has since been developed formally by linguists such as A.J.
Melcuk and R.A. Hudson as alternatives to grammars of the more familiar
transformational sort. (For references see Melcuk 1979, Schachter 1980.)
All of these grammars, however, exploit theoretical resources weaker than
those available to Husserl, since they employ exclusively the notion of
unilateral dependence or its equivalents. The idea of a dependence or categorial
grammar utilising also relations of mutual dependence is currently in process
of investigation by William Haas.
<P>Husserl's theory of dependence was employed also by the linguist Roman
Jakobson, above all in his work on distinctive features in phonology and
on implicational universals of language acquisition. (See Holenstein 1976.)
But its most thorough-going application was carried out by the Munich phenomenologist
Adolf Reinach in his "Die apriorischen Grundlagen des b}rgerlichen Rechts"
of 1913. Reinach's work is, notwithstanding its somewhat misleading title,
an investigation of the ontology of those complex structures which are
actions of promising, commanding, forgiving, questioning, and so on, structures
which straddle the borderlines not only of linguistics and psychology but
also of jurisprudence and the theory of action. A good case can indeed
be made for the claim that Reinach, already in 1913, had set forth the
essential elements of what later came to be called the theory of speech
acts. His work even contains a discussion of the various 'infelicities'
to which speech acts can be subjected, not, however, in terms of any quasi-logical
'conditions of satisfaction', but rather in terms of a theory of the various
possible sorts of ontological modifications which structures involving
speech acts may undergo, a theory which is then applied also to throw light
on the ways in which such structures may be affected by determinations
of the positive law. (See Mulligan ed., and also Smith 1986 and 1986a for
further details.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>4. Acts and their Distinctive Features</B>
<P>It is Husserl's own application of his theory of species and dependence
to the problem of linguistic meaning which will engage our attention for
the remainder of this paper. Husserl's theory of meaning in the <I>Logical
Investigations</I> is an act-based theory. Language is seen as having meaning
only to the extent that there are subjects who bestow meanings upon specific
expressions in specific sorts of mental acts.<SUP><A HREF="#7">7</A></SUP>
Before we can present this theory, however, we shall need to say something
about the internal structures of mental acts in general.
<P>Internal structure is captured by recognising dependence relations amongst
really existing parts. Thus every act, according to Husserl, manifests
the three distinctive features of quality, matter and intuitive act-content.
These three features stand in a three-sided dependence relation: no instance
of the species <I>act quality</I> can exist except in a larger whole in
which it is bound up with instances of the species <I>matter</I> and <I>intuitive
content</I>, and these in turn cannot exist without each other and without
an instance of the species <I>act quality</I>. The space of acts is in
this sense three-dimensional.<SUP><A HREF="#8">8</A></SUP>
<P>The quality of an act is the way in which the act is intentionally directed
towards its object: signitively or intuitively, in perception or in imagination,
and so on. The matter of an act is that feature of the act in virtue of
which its object is given as an F or as a G: as a flower or as a rose,
as a noise or as an explosion, as inviting or as threatening, and so on.<SUP><A HREF="#9">9</A></SUP>
And the intuitive content (which Husserl also refers to as 'hyletic data')
is that feature which embraces all that is sensuously given in the act,
including, for an act of language- use, <I>sensuous signs</I> (words, or
such constituents of thoughts as correspond to words).
<P>What does Husserl mean when he says that an act exhibits these three
distinctive features? Consider an act of seeing an apple. This act can
be imagined as varying in (at least) three different ways: I can imagine
myself turning away from the apple and remembering exactly what I saw.
My act of remembering then has a matter and intuitive content that are
similar to those of the perceptual act on which it is founded. The quality
of the act of memory, however, is quite different from that of the perception
that precedes it. Similarly, I can imagine myself seeing the apple, but
in such a way that what I (think I) see is a pear. Here quality and intuitive
content are the same, but the matter is different. Or I can imagine myself
seeing the apple for example under different lighting conditions. Quality
and matter are thereby fixed, while intuitive content varies. Or again:
suppose that I make two different assertions, one after the other. Here
the qualities involved in my two acts are the same, the matters differ.
If, on the other hand, I assert p and then subsequently wonder whether
p, then the matters are the same, the qualities differ.
<P>Quality, matter and intuitive content can themselves in turn be internally
complex. Thus consider the intuitive content of an act of perception of
a musical tone. Here we discover at least three abstractly distinguishable
parts of the content, corresponding to the three abstractly distinguishable
features of the tone - its pitch, timbre and loudness - mentioned above.
Just as these features reflect dimensions of variation in the tone, so
the corresponding parts of the intuitive content reflect dimensions of
variation in the act. And it is easy to see that, as with the tone, so
also with the act, each part or feature is such that, as a matter of necessity,
it cannot exist in isolation from the others.
<P>Importantly, this claim is not affected by the fact that there are many
of us who hear tones but do not <I>know</I> that we thereby also hear,
say, timbre (who do not know what timbre is). For the existence of an act
part is not to be confused with its being noticed or recognised: the fact
that a subject is not able to identify, discriminate or name parts, moments
or features of his acts is irrelevant to the question whether or not they
are there.<SUP><A HREF="#10">10</A></SUP> If Fritz can hear a difference
between a violin tone and an oboe tone of the same pitch and intensity,
then his act contains a timbre-component. He needs only to hear the difference,
not say or recognise what it consists in. As we shall see, this is one
dimension of the ontology of the act - we shall encounter others below
- to which phenomenology would seem to be inadequate. For the dimensions
of acts, like the dimensions of musical tones, are in some sense <I>objective</I>;
they are independent of what an individual or a society notices, or of
what a natural language expresses.
<P>It has been assumed in all of the above that mental acts are internally
complex spatio-temporal entities whose features instantiate species (in
the sense of our discussion in section 2 above). This holds in particular
of acts of bestowing meaning upon expressions, which are simply those acts
which do the job of supplying <I>objects</I> for the expressions in question.
These objects are things, events, processes, etc., in the case of nominal
expressions, states of affairs in the case of judgments. Such 'oobjectifying
acts', too, manifest the three dimensions of matter, quality and intuitive
content, a fact which Husserl exploits to produce his own, quite specific
account of linguistic meaning. He argues, in fact, that linguistic meanings
are, just, certain species: they are, roughly, the species of those acts
which are acts of meaning-bestowal.<SUP><A HREF="#11">11</A></SUP> Two
immediate advantages of this theory can be pointed out immediately. The
first is trivial, relating to an ambiguity in our use of the verb 'express'.
Thus on the one hand we are accustomed to saying that uses of language
express their (ideal, abstract) <I>meanings</I>, and on the other hand
that such uses express certain <I>acts</I> on the part of the language-using
subject. This ambiguity is not a matter of accident, on Husserl's theory;
it flows directly from the fact that act and meaning relate to each other
as instance to species. The second advantage relates to uses of language
in communication. If Erna understands what Hans says, then whilst Hans's
and Erna's thoughts are numerically distinct internally complex events,
they are yet such that, in virtue of the similarity of their matters (and
therefore also of their objects), they are instances of one and the same
species (at some point on the meaning tree). When two interlocutors successfully
communicate we can describe what this success consists in by appealing
to this identity of species, that is, to the existence of a certain constancy
or regularity in the space of mental acts of the relevant community of
language-using subjects.
<P>Now whilst Brentano and Husserl have shown that an ontological theory
can be developed which can do justice to the structures of acts, it remains
the case - as is unavoidable, given the nature of the subject-matter -
that such an ontology is both problematic and highly complex. There remains,
therefore, a certain temptation to ignore acts and to look instead at linguistic
expressions. Such expressions are after all obviously and cleanly separable
from each other and - in non-Cretan cases - from associated referents.
They also have the advantage of being publicly accessible. Further, many
of the structures of acts are manifested also in the kinds of things we
<U>say</U>,
and thus the linguistic study of descriptions or reports of mental acts
may well have light to throw on such structures, were its advocates once
freed of the tendency to read into the domain of acts structural simplifications
derived from the spheres of logic or language.<SUP><A HREF="#12">12</A></SUP>
<P>More often, however, the philosophical investigation of language has
been held to enable of by-passing theoretical concern with mental acts
through the study of those overt <I>actions</I> in which language gets
used. As is shown already by the work of Reinach, there is much in the
action-centred approach which makes it congenial to the ontological position
defended here. It is an approach which rejects the conception of language
as a matter of abstract types, turning away from abstract models in general
and paying attention instead to the real events, scattered through time
and space, in which language gets used. Modern philosophers of action argue
further, however, that the sympathetic treatment of such real events makes
the appeal to mental acts unnecessary.
<P>It was Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), in particular, who had the aim
of dislodging theoretical or cognitive acts from the preeminence they have
enjoyed in post-Cartesian philosophy.<SUP><A HREF="#13">13</A></SUP> Deeper
than any agreement in judgment, Wittgenstein insists, is agreement in habits
and traditions. If mental acts exist at all, then they are a derivative
phenomenon, owing whatever status they might have to their manifestations
in overt behaviour.
<P>It is indeed tempting to agree with Wittgenstein that the examination
of overt expressions, and of all that is bound up therewith, will go some
way toward making superfluous the direct investigation of the structures
of acts, indeed that there is a a subservience of descriptions of mental
episodes to descriptions of what is public or overt. Even then, however,
it would be important to understand the precise nature of the ontological
relations between mental acts and overt utterances, and an examination
of Wittgenstein's very soon reveals that - in marked contrast to Husserl
- he simply does not have the theoretical resources available to establish
what these relations might be. He was thereby constrained, like Gottlob
Frege (1848-1925) before him, and like the formal semanticists whom he
attacked, to adopt an unrealistic position to the effect that mental acts
are somehow incidental epiphenomena, superfluous shadows, lacking in cognitive
value or theoretical relevance.
<P>Now there are, trivially, three alternatives regarding the dependence
relations between mental acts and overt or public linguistic behaviour:
(I) the former are one-sidedly dependent on the latter, (II) the latter
is dependent on the former, (III) the two are mutually dependent on each
other.
<P>(I) is clearly unacceptable (one need only try to imagine what it would
be like to have uses of language without mental acts), yet this seems to
be what is involved in the extreme thesis to the effect that mental acts
are merely derivative epiphenomena.
<P>(II) implies the Cartesian thesis according to which language is dispensable
(is a mere 'clothing of thought'). Consider Hans, who is alone in his room,
thinking hard about whether or not Erna really loves him. Hans arrives
at a number of conclusions which he considers, rejects, and so on. In Hans's
judgments Erna occurs again and again, different predicates are attributed
to her in succession, now in memory, now in imagination. Do we not have
here a freedom of variation of Hans's mental acts with respect to the level
of overt expression? Certainly what Hans <I>thinks</I> is independent of
what he would <I>say</I> were he to communicate his judgments to, say,
his brother Otto. But does this imply that language is a mere 'dispensable
clothing'?
<P>More careful consideration shows that Hans's thoughts are in fact only
<I>locally</I>
independent of linguistic utterances. All of these silent judgings are
still <I>globally</I> dependent on language in the sense that they are
of such a complexity that they could not occur unless language existed
(unless the facility existed in Hans to use the expressions of a natural
language and to manifest this facility in overt actions). It is this fact,
also, which explains why there is a subservience of descriptions of mental
episodes to descriptions of what is public or overt.<SUP><A HREF="#14">14</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Which leaves us with (III). Language is clearly dependent on thought,
or rather on mental acts in general, since there can be no learning of
language (and no communication at all) without for example the exercise
of associated perceptions. And thought is also dependent on language, in
the (global) sense just mentioned. This two-sided dependence is first of
all a developmental thesis: language cannot be learned except against a
background which includes, e.g., acts of perception. But more: it seems
that, beyond a certain threshold of complexity, mental acts cannot occur
except against a simultaneously existing background which involves linguistic
habits and skills which have been inculcated publicly (habits and skills
which will of course manifest dependence relations of their own, on different
levels). This gives rise to a further set of problems for an ontology of
language, problems having to do with the relations between the mental and
the social.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>6. Against Cartesianism</B>
<P>The present paper, for all its talk of acts, is not an exercise in Husserlian
phenomenology, i.e. in the description of those parts or moments of acts
that are transparent to their subjects. Our use of 'act' differs essentially
from the favoured use of the later Husserl, who
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>excludes from the notion of an act any 'extra-experiential'
or 'non-phenomenological' elements that may be connected with them. By
an <I>act</I> Husserl means just that component of an intentional event
of consciousness that the subject himself can discern by 'reflecting' on
his experience, excluding empirical facts about the intended object and
its<I> de facto</I> relation to the subject. Hence, an act is just what
we might call the 'experiential' component of an intentional event, 'purified'
(as Husserl says) of presumptions concerning its 'interlacing with nature'
(Woodruff Smith and McIntyre 1982:3).</BLOCKQUOTE>
One principal thesis of this paper - which finds support both in the realist
critique of Husserl's transcendental phenomenology (as expressed, e.g.,
in the writings of Roman Ingarden) and also in more recent work by analytic
philosophers on singular reference, indexicality, <I>de re</I> belief,
<I>de
re</I> perception and the like (see e.g. Evans 1982 and Woodfield 1982)
- is that this Cartesian approach to the structures of acts is radically
misconceived. Acts are simply one further variety of individual entity,
existing in the real world along with substances, processes, states and
events of other kinds. (See Mulligan and Smith 1986, for a more detailed
elaboration of this thesis.) Acts differ from most other real entities
in the fact that we can have <I>some</I> privileged or 'inner' access to
them. But, this access is (almost always?) partial. And the fact that it
is available should not blind us to the fact that, as real events in the
spatio-temporal world, acts are susceptible also to various sorts of objective
or public access - including access via our linguistic expressions - making
possible a description of their ontological structure in a way which is
no different, in principle, from that which can be provided for entities
of other sorts.
<P>Cartesian assumptions remain powerful in contemporary philosophy however,
for example in the form in which they have been revived by J.A. Fodor (1981)
as the doctrine of 'methodological solipsism'. It will thus be useful to
underline why it is that they lead their proponents astray. Such assumptions
may be summarised in the two-fold thesis to the effect that
<P>(i) each individual human consciousness has a privileged access to his
own mental phenomena;
<P>(ii) the mental phenomena of each individual subject constitute a self-contained
domain, somehow effectively isolable from the order of nature in such a
way that our mental experience in its entirety would be <I>exactly as it
is </I>even though the external world did not exist.
<P>The idea that each consciousness has a privileged access to his own
acts can be challenged on a number of fronts. It corresponds linguistically
to the idea that mental verbs should be glossed as opaque in all occurrences
of use. (Cf. Husserl 1984, &sect; &sect; 4f; Simons 1983.) Yet the normal
or unmarked sense of such verbs is transparent, the opaque sense requiring
a special setting, such as the report of a psychiatric patient or dream-
teller or vision-seer, this report and its evaluation being independent
of the existence or otherwise of a corresponding referent. (One such special
setting is provided by the philosophical activity known as descriptive
phenomenology.) Further, the opaque reading of a mental verb must be parasitic
on the transparent reading: for when such a verb is interpreted in the
opaque sense, the associated object-clause is read as giving an account
of what the subject is aware of in the relevant experience indirectly:
by seeming to give a description of an object, the transparent experience
of which by a normal subject would involve him in having experiences relevantly
similar to the subject in question.
<P>The second component in the assumption of Cartesianism has been challenged
above all by Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein rejects the idea that there is
a discriminable totality of all of that to which the subject has 'inner'
access on the grounds that our ability to find our way around the parts
of such a totality would of necessity depend upon capacities acquired whilst
moving in the domain of what is publicly accessible. There is no way, he
insists, in which a self-contained stratum of 'consciousness' could be
carved out from the plethora of forms of interaction, both active and passive,
overt and covert, of a human being with its animate and inanimate environment.
And from this it follows that any putative classifications of private objects
must obscure at least some important structural traits of the phenomena
to be described.
<P>Both our mental life and our overt actions rest on expressed and unexpressed
habits and traditions, acquired above all through education and upbringing
and through our experiences of the actions of others (including actions
of correction and constraint provoked by our own overt behaviour). It is
this background of shared traditions which makes our mental life, and our
own understanding of our mental life, possible. By shaping and determining
our overt utterances it thereby indirectly shapes and determines the repertoire
of types of act which we have at our disposal, and at the same time ensures
that the deployment of this repertoire is to a large extent a matter of
ingrained reflex - or at least a matter over which we have only very fragmentary
conscious control. Thus even the mental acts which occur are not such that
they admit of any transparent access.
<P>It will be clear, again, that such Wittgensteinian arguments should
not be seen as implying that there are no mental acts. Wittgenstein has
shown only that a totality of mental acts cannot be separated out from
its surroundings, and above all that such a totality cannot be separated
out from the public domain constituted by the actions, and especially the
speech actions, in which we engage. But what cannot be separated out, what
does not exist independently of its surroundings, does not thereby lose
its claim to exist. One of the presuppositions of Wittgenstein's philosophy
is precisely that there is no such thing as a dependent or non-separable
existent. For if it made sense to distinguish between independent and dependent
existents then it would make sense to talk of things having an a priori
order, and this is something that Wittgenstein denies again and again throughout
his work.<SUP><A HREF="#15">15</A></SUP>

<P><B>7. Husserl's Noema Theory of Meaning</B>
<P>Sometime after the publication of the <I>Logical Investigations</I>,
Husserl himself abandoned the theory of linguistic meaning as species and
introduced a new view of meanings as special abstract entities, which he
called <I>noemata</I>.
<P>Anglo-Saxon readers of Husserl - indeed almost all his commentators
- have interpreted his development from the <I>Investigations</I> to the
<I>Ideas</I>
in a way which takes for granted that the teleology which Husserl himself
retrospectively inscribed upon his changes of mind - his 'development'
- has some basis in the facts themselves. Thus it has been assumed that
Husserl's rejection of the theory of meaning as <I>species
</I>in favour
of the theory of meaning as <I>noema</I> was somehow justified. This assumption
seems, however, to be supported only by appeal to what Husserl himself
has to say about the matter (after he has already given up the earlier
position), and by the presence of a number of peripheral, if intriguing,
similarities between the noema theory and the theory of
<I>Sinne</I> developed
by Frege in his "ber Sinn und Bedeutung". It is nevertheless interesting
to spend some time examining the later theory, particularly in the refined
form it has been given by Fllesdal (in a number of papers) and by McIntyre
and Woodruff Smith (especially in their book of 1982), since this may be
said to combine many of the benefits of the language-based approach with
a framework within which mental acts are capable of being taken seriously.<SUP><A HREF="#16">16</A></SUP>
<P>On Husserl's earlier (species) theory, if Erna understands what Hans
says, then this is because Hans's and Erna's thoughts are instances of
the same species (at some level of generality), a fact which is itself
to be understood in terms of certain kinds of constancy (similarity of
parts) in the space of mental acts - constancy which has come about through
a certain historical process (Hans and Erna share the same background of
habits and skills). On the later (noema) theory no such historical account
is possible, for we are dealing not with constancy amidst real variation,
but with abstract meaning-entities outside space and time. Hans succeeds
in communicating with Erna, on this account, because the meaning of his
utterance, a certain abstract noematic <I>Sinn</I>, becomes the meaning
of Erna's act of registering this utterance. It is as if the noematic senses
are stars in an abstract heaven to which our successive acts, and even
the successive acts of distinct subjects, may - somehow - be identically
directed.
<P>So far, so Fregean.
<P>Husserl's noema theory can be said to be superior to Frege's in at least
one respect however. For Husserl provides an account of the noemata or
senses of <I>all</I> acts: perceptual, imaginative, judgmental, etc., where
Frege can cope only with judgmental acts, or more specifically with the
language bound up with specific sorts of judgmental act. This is an important
advantage, since if we want to deal, e.g., with indexical uses of language
('That bird is flying high'), we shall find it necessary to recognise that
the relevant utterances can be meaningful only if they occur as parts of
larger wholes which include acts of perception directed toward non-linguistic
objects.<SUP><A HREF="#17">17</A></SUP> In this very advantage of Husserl's
later theory lies a danger however. For the structure and individuation
conditions of abstract noemata are essentially derived from our understanding
of the logical structures of corresponding linguistic expressions. (This,
surely, is the central message of the new 'Frege-Husserl semantics'.) If,
therefore, we insist that abstract noemata are such as to exhaust the meanings
also of perceptual acts, then we would seem to be trying to bring into
coincidence two entirely different sorts of structure - having different
sorts of multiplicity. For the structures of linguistic meanings are discrete,
subject to those sorts of non-continuous variation which come about through
the divisions and combinations dictated e.g. by the rules of syntax. The
structures of perceptual contents, in contrast, are continuously variable
along a number of qualitatively highly specific dimensions, in a way which
implies that it is impossible that there could ever be a fitting together
of the two of the sort that is required by the newly fashionable interpretations
of Husserl's later theory.
<P>The earlier theory, on the other hand, which draws a sharp line between
the two sorts of content, is subject to no such danger. And in other respects,
too, the comparison between Husserl's own successive theories of meaning
is not at all to the disadvantage of the former. Indeed neither in Husserl,
nor in contemporary proponents of the noema, is any argument given for
favouring the later theory rather than the earlier. This is true not least
because the earlier theory is not, in any of the secondary literature,
worked out in detail.<SUP><A HREF="#18">18</A></SUP>
<P>When Husserl's two successive theories are compared, we see a number
of advantages of the former. This is so, first of all, in regard to their
respective ontological commitments. Both theories accept the need for mental
acts as real events (in the later theory these are called 'noeses'). Further,
both accept the need for some account of generality. Indeed the later theory
distinguishes (and this is just for starters): the noematic <I>Sinn</I>
of an act, the matter of the act which 'entertains' this <I>Sinn</I> (a
certain real moment), the essence or species of this matter, and in principle
also the essence or species of the noematic <I>Sinn</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#19">19</A></SUP>
The earlier theory, in contrast, has only acts (certain real events), their
parts, and the species these instantiate, and we have seen that even the
latter need not, of necessity, be taken ontologically seriously. Further,
the relations of species to instance and of part to whole to which it appeals
are well understood.
<P>The later theory, in contrast, needs relations capable of embracing
as their relata both abstract and concrete entities (as if such heterogeneous
entities could be capable of being combined together within a single whole).
As Woodruff Smith and McIntyre inadvertantly reveal (cf. their diagram
on p.134), the intermediary role of abstract noemata saddles us with two
insoluble problems:
<P>(i) the problem of entertaining, i.e. the problem of the relation of
the noema to concrete mental episodes. (How can a real mental event exist
together with an abstract <I>noema/Sinn</I> within a single whole?)
<P>(ii) the problem of anchorage, i.e., the problem of the relation of
the noema to concrete objects. (How can a mental act, in somehow grasping
an abstract <I>noema</I>, thereby be directed or referred e.g. to a concrete
thing?)
<P>Woodruff Smith and McIntyre's own suggested solution to the first of
these two problems operates at the level of metaphor. An act, they say,
"<I>intends</I> (is directed toward or is intentionally related to) an
object if and only if the act (or its noesis) entertains a certain noematic
<I>Sinn</I>
and that <I>Sinn</I> prescribes that object" (Woodruff Smith &amp; McIntyre
1982:143). But what is this 'entertaining', which appears to be a peculiar
sort of non- intentional intentionality?<SUP><A HREF="#20">20</A></SUP>
It seems, indeed, that the word 'entertains' can elucidate nothing. It
merely recalls an exactly parallel problem in the interpretation of Fregean
philosophy, the problem of giving an account of the relation of <I>Fassen</I>
between an act of thinking and a Fregean <I>Gedanke</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#21">21</A></SUP>
It is perhaps significant that Woodruff Smith and McIntyre (<I>op. cit.</I>)
find no further analysis of entertaining in Husserl's own writings. Rather
than accepting this as sufficient evidence of a major flaw, either in their
interpretation of Husserl's theory or in the theory itself - that perhaps
a view of the relation between act and meaning along the lines of the earlier
theory might be right after all - they take refuge behind a set-theoretical
analysis of 'entertaining', conceiving it as a 'many-one or functional
relation' (1982:146). But the rigmarole of functions across possible worlds
which they wheel forth in order to support this view (cf. their chs. 6
and 7) yields (at best) nothing more than a rather shaky structural analogy;
it does not tell us what the ontological status of these peculiar abstracta
and of the associated relations might conceivably be.
<P>In regard to the problem of anchorage, Husserl himself was ultimately
to by-pass this problem by abandoning the attempt to establish contact
between noema and world (the insidious pressure of the noema theory in
the direction of 'transcendental idealism'). For it seems that the noema
theory is unable to specify <I>which</I> objects acts are directed towards.
Noemata are abstract entities (they are rather like the 'concepts' of old).
In no sense are they tied up with or sensitive to the concrete and individual
spatio-temporal entities which (as we normally conceive things) people
the world of our experience. Thus the noema theorist has no way to distinguish,
say, thinking-about- McIntyre from thinking-about-some-philosopher-qualitatively-
indistinguishable-from-McIntyre. To succeed in describing a particular
person's thinking-about-McIntyre (his being minded in just <I>this</I>
way), we need to recognise that his acts, and their background, are tied
to a certain segment of reality, that they are one-sidedly dependent upon
certain objects, in the sense of our discussion above (see Smith 1984 for
a view along these lines).
<P>Something similar holds even where there is no object of our act, for
instance where we are thinking (as we conceive things) about the god Jupiter.
For here, too, there is a problem of anchorage: even our acts of thinking-about-Jupiter
need to be distinguished from acts of thinking-about-some-god-qualitatively-
identical-with-Jupiter, and to this end they must be tied into a certain
complex background which includes ancient Mediterranean peoples, their
religious beliefs, traditions and practices, and the remnants and reports
which survive in various media and inform us of these.<SUP><A HREF="#22">22</A></SUP>
This is another dimension in which Husserlian phenomenology is inadequate
to the ontology of acts: it fails to do justice to this background, which
exists in virtue of a network of foundation relations between any given
act and the <I>objects</I> of prior acts with which it is associated.
<P>The response of the noema-theorist is to seek to simulate this mundane
background by complicating his account of the mutual interrelations among
acts, by appealing to what is called the act's '<I>horizon</I>' (<I>Ideas</I>
I, &sect; 149).
<P>The clearest account of this matter is provided by Woodruff Smith and
McIntyre (<I>op. cit.</I>) in their ch. 5. Every act, they tell us, has
a horizon, fixed by specific components of the act's <I>Sinn</I> together
with parts of the subject's conceptual scheme or belief- system. Now it
is of course reasonable to seek to extend the phenomenology of the act
by recognising a role for background beliefs, even those background beliefs
that are not "active" phenomena of consciousness in the way the act itself
is (1982:254). We could see this background as somehow latent in an act,
present in it 'in the form of a <I>habitus</I>' (Husserl, 1947, &sect;
25, cf. also &sect; 67b). The Husserl of 'horizons' and 'noemata' is not,
however, operating with real events and states and with their real cumulation
through time, nor with that background of knowledge that is actually acquired
in our past experience. He is operating, rather, with peculiar non-actual
dispositions.<SUP><A HREF="#23">23</A></SUP> Thus he sees an act's horizon
as consisting of various <I>possible</I> acts, in which the object of the
initial act would be intended under various further aspects, with details
filled in about (say) those sides of the object that are originally hidden
from view (WS &amp; M, p.239). The horizon of an act of perception, for
example, would consist of perceptions the perceiver <I>could have had</I>
in the past (and indeed in the future also) (Woodruff Smith and McIntyre,
1982:259). The noematic senses of these merely possible components of the
horizon are then held, <I>as if by magic</I>, to contribute to determining
which object the act is directed towards:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>The complete "meaning" of an individuative act, as we have
described it, typically includes not only the sense (<I>Sinn</I>) that
is actually and "explicitly" present in the act,...but also the system
of senses correlated with certain related background beliefs. A complete
phenomenological analysis of the act must embrace those senses as well...because
it is [they] that ultimately prescribe which individual the act is directed
toward or is about. (1982:390)</BLOCKQUOTE>
The problem of objective reference is hereby however shunted off into a
corner of dark 'potentialities'. Not only is this appeal subject to the
objection that it is an account of what is real in terms of what is merely
possible. Even on its own terms it is not adequate to do the job which
it has set itself: no account of the phenomenology of a person's acts,
not even when the implicit or latent 'horizon' of these acts is taken into
account, not even when their various 'sedimentations' are taken into account,
can ensure for these acts the appropriate referent. For again, even the
complicated horizonal background could in principle occur elsewhere, e.g.,
on Putnam's twin-earth. To anchor putative reference to 'our' Jupiter and
his background as distinct from twin-Jupiter and his background we need
an indispensable relational element, and this means breaking out of the
phenomenological circle and taking the acts of the subject <I>in their
natural setting</I>, intervolved in manifold ways with the rest of the
world.

1985a and 1986 - listed in the bibliography below. Thanks are due also
to Karl Schuhmann for helpful comments.
<P><A NAME="2"></A><SUP>2</SUP> I shall concentrate in what follows on
empirical uses of sentences in a natural setting, sentences for which it
seems reasonable to assume that some truth-maker exists. See Mulligan,

<P><A NAME="3"></A><SUP>3</SUP> See e.g. LU II &sect; 3. The real parts
in question are sometimes called by Brentano and Husserl 'logical parts':
see Brentano 1982, p.20, Mulligan and Smith 1985, and LU III &sect; &sect;
1f.
<P><A NAME="4"></A><SUP>4</SUP> See also, more lately, Prior 1949 and Searle
1959. The fact that Husserl's understanding of logic and ontology and of
form and matter rests on the assumption of the tree-structure of species
is evident from his repeated discussions e.g. of lowest species and differentiae,
of species and genera, of ideal singulars, etc. See e.g. LU "Prolegomena"
&sect; &sect; 46, 70; I &sect; &sect; 31, 33; II &sect; 26; III &sect;
&sect; 7a, 10f., 16, 22; IV &sect; 7; V &sect; 26. Compare also Husserl's
letter to Lipps of Jan. 1904 (Schuhmann 1977), and Willard 1984, e.g. p.64.
That this background of Aristotelian ontology was important to Husserl
is clear also from the first chapter of the first book of the <I>Ideen</I>
- and we can conjecture that he included this extensive treatment of the
Aristotelian theory of generality precisely because he was concerned by
the lack of understanding of his intentions in the earlier work.
<P><A NAME="5"></A><SUP>5</SUP> Thus in LU III &sect; 14 Husserl refers
to 'the great scientific interest that the constitution of a deductive
theoretical transformation claims in every field'. 'Nothing can show up
the value of an exact determination more clearly than the possibility of
giving a deductive proof of <I>such propositions as are familiar to us</I>
in a different guise.' (Emphasis mine.) The theoretical interest of the
idea of dependence derives also from the fact that, as Husserl has shown,
it can contribute to the understanding of a range of other central formal
ontological notions. The work of Ingarden (1964/65) suggests further that
by distinguishing between different notions of dependence one can produce
a theory of great power in the domain of general metaphysics.

(and aggregates thereof) in the list of references below.

and on Husserl's theory in particular see Smith 1986.
<P><A NAME="8"></A><SUP>8</SUP> This account applies strictly speaking
only to what Husserl calls objectifying acts, but since all other acts
- for example episodic emotional phenomena - are themselves one-sidedly
founded on objectifying acts, the matter-quality-intuitive content distinction
is in effect inherited by these also. Cf. LU V &sect; 41.
<P><A NAME="9"></A><SUP>9</SUP> Husserl's distinction between quality and
matter had its origins in the distinction between <I>act</I>, <I>content</I>,
and <I>object</I> first clearly formulated by Twardowski in his 1894. The
opposition between the content and object of an act is in its turn often
compared with Frege's opposition between the sense and reference of an
expression. It is necessary to emphasise already here, however, that the
matter of an act as Husserl understands it in the LU cannot be equated
with any abstract entity (e.g. with a 'proposition' or a '<I>Sinn</I>').
For act matters are real, individual parts of mental events; abstract entities,
in contrast (if they exist at all), are outside space and time.
<P><A NAME="10"></A><SUP>10</SUP> Compare the account of noticing put forward
by Brentano in his 1982, pp.31-64, and see also Wenning 1986 and Stephens

is mirrored by a corresponding complexity of the act.
<P><A NAME="11"></A><SUP>11</SUP> The 'roughly' is inserted here in order
to draw attention to the fact that not all parts and moments of those concrete
mental events through which uses of language get their meaning are relevant
to this meaning. For further details see Smith 1986b.
<P><A NAME="12"></A><SUP>12</SUP> Some philosophers have even gone so far
as to impose a sentential form upon simple acts of perception (such that
my seeing the on-coming fist is already a 'disguised judgment'): see Mulligan,
Simons, Smith 1984. The view that perceiving is propositional is not an
invention of analytic philosophers - there may be traces of the idea even
in Hume and the first major attack on the idea is in Husserl's 5th Logical
Investigation.

discussions with Kevin Mulligan.
<P><A NAME="16"></A><SUP>16</SUP> I shall concentrate in what follows on
Woodruff Smith and McIntyre's book of 1982 (abbreviated as WS &amp; M).
The book is an excellent example of Husserl scholarship of the sort that
has been sadly lacking since the heyday of phenomenology in the early years
of the century, and I am grateful to its authors for useful discussions
of its content. I hope that no apology is needed for the somewhat critical
tone of my treatment, for I have of course passed over in silence those
points in the book with which I am in agreement.
<P><A NAME="17"></A><SUP>17</SUP> See Mulligan and Smith 1985a. It was
above all Buehler who developed Husserl's ideas in the direction of a general
theory of indexicality: see Mulligan (forthcoming).
<P><A NAME="18"></A><SUP>18</SUP> A single, noble exception to this general
trend is the work of Dallas Willard, above all his 1972 and 1984. See also
Hoche 1973, p.203, and K}ng 1976, who give textual evidence that Husserl
very belatedly entertained the view that his position at the time of the
LU was possibly right after all.
<P><A NAME="19"></A><SUP>19</SUP> For a fuller account - minus the dimension
of essence or species - see the diagram on p.136 of Woodruff Smith and
McIntyre's book.
<P><A NAME="20"></A><SUP>20</SUP> Thus we are told for example that entertaining
a <U>Sinn</U> 'does not require any explicit awareness of the <I>Sinn</I>
by the subject who so entertains it' (p.144).
<P><A NAME="21"></A><SUP>21</SUP> Cf. Willard 1984, 180ff. The metaphor
of entertaining recalls also the central weakness in once popular accounts
of belief and other 'propositional attitudes' as a matter of a believer's
being directed towards an abstract 'proposition'.
<P><A NAME="22"></A><SUP>22</SUP> I am grateful to Peter Simons (1983)
for this point.
<P><A NAME="23"></A><SUP>23</SUP> Woodruff Smith and McIntyre (1982) sometimes
suggest further these horizons are like noemata in being abstract entities,
which would imply that they were entirely outside the temporal domain of
what happens and is the case. I shall ignore this question here.
