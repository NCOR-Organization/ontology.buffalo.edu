directed because it is associated with a belief of a certain special sort, whose 
intentional directedness is not towards any putative external object but rather

margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify"><span class="QuickFormat4"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The paper defends a theory of mind
according to which certain sorts of acts are &lsquo;real material relations&rsquo; and
compares this theory to causal theories of reference and perception. All mental
acts are dependent for their existence upon the subject (person, organism)
whose acts they are. Relational acts are dependent also on intended objects in
the world. The relational theory thus implies a rejection of the Cartesian
thesis to the effect that we could in principle have exactly the same thoughts even
though the objects of these thoughts did not exist. It implies thereby also a
rejection of Husserlian phenomenology. Husserl&rsquo;s earlier work on the formal
ontology of part, whole and dependence nevertheless provides a framework which
can allow a precise formulation of the relational theory.</span></span></p>

margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify"><span class="QuickFormat4"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The paper defends a view of
perceptual acts as real relations of a subject to an object. To make this view
coherent, a theory of different types of relations is developed, resting on
ideas on formal ontology put forward by Husserl in his <i>Logical
Investigations</i> and on the theory of relations sketched in my &ldquo;Acta cum
fundamentis in re&rdquo;. The theory is applied to the notion of a Cambridge change,
which proves to have an unforeseen relevance to our understanding of
perception.</span></span></p>

Theory of Indexicality</a>&rdquo;, in <i>Grazer Philosophische Studien</i>, 28

<p class="Level1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.0in;margin-bottom:3.95pt;
margin-left:1.5in"><span class="QuickFormat4"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">It is well known that Husserl&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Logical
Investigations&nbsp;</i>contain the beginnings of an account of the meanings of
indexical expressions, expressions whose meanings depend essentially on some
sort of explicit or implicit pointing or indication [<i>Anzeigen</i>], and
therefore on some contribution by the surroundings of speaker and hearer.
Husserl in fact speaks explicitly of &lsquo;occasional expressions&rsquo;, that is of
expressions like &lsquo;this&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo; whose meanings depend on features of the
occasion of use, but it is possible to gauge the full implications of his
explicit remarks on the problem of indexical or occasional meanings only if
these are read in conjunction with what he says elsewhere in
the&nbsp;Investigations, especially on the subject of perceptual judgments and
proper names. Moreover, Husserl&rsquo;s deliberations on indication, perception and
naming, as also what he has to say on demonstrative pronouns, spatial and
temporal adverbs and tenses, must themselves be understood&mdash;like everything
else in this work&mdash;as applications of a very general theory of meaning and of
structure or dependence.&nbsp;In what follows we shall set out Husserl&rsquo;s
account of indexicality and develop it in various ways. Unlike Husserl himself&mdash;who retrospectively described his own account as an &lsquo;act of violence&rsquo;&mdash;we
are strongly of the opinion that this effort is worthwhile.</span></span></p>

margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The
ontology of language is concerned with the relations between uses of language,
both overt and covert, and other entities, whether in the world or in the mind
of the thinking subject. We attempt a first survey of the sorts of relations
which might come into question for such an ontology, including: relations
between referring uses of expressions and their objects, relations between the
use of a (true) sentence and that in the world which makes it true, relations
between mental acts on the one hand and underlying mental states (attitudes,
beliefs), on the other, relations between my acts and states, associated uses
of language and overt actions on my part and on the part of those other
subjects with whom I communicate.</span></p>

margin-left:1.5in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The
theory of speech acts put forward by Adolf Reinach in his "The A Priori
Foundations of the Civil Law" of 1913 rests on a systematic account of the
ontological structures associated with various different sorts of language use.
One of the most original features of Reinach's account lies in hIs demonstration
of how the ontological structure of, say, an action of promising or of
commanding, may be modified in different ways, yielding different sorts of
non-standard instances of the corresponding speech act varieties. The present
paper is an attempt to apply this idea of standard and modified instances of
ontological structures to the realm of judgement and cognition, and thereby to
develop a Reinachian theory of how intentionality is mediated through language
in acts of thinking and speaking.</span><span class="QuickFormat4"><span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;Barry

<span style="font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) was created to serve as a domain&#8208;neutral 
resource for the representation of types of information content entities (ICEs) 
such as documents, data&#8208;bases, and digital im&#8208;ages. We identify a series of 
problems with the current version of the IAO and suggest solutions designed to 
advance our understanding of the relations between ICEs and associated cognitive 
representations in the minds of human subjects. This requires embedding IAO in a 
larger framework of ontologies, including most importantly the Mental 
Func&#8208;tioning Ontology (MFO). It also requires a careful treatment of the 
aboutness relations between ICEs and associated cognitive representa&#8208;tions and 
their targets in reality. </span></p>
