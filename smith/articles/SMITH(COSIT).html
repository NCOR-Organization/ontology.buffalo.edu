<blockquote><b>Abstract:</b> Where some have attempted to apply cognitive
methods to the study of geography, the present paper is designed to serve
as a starting point for applying methods of geographic ontology to the
phenomena of cognition. Agglomerations are aggregates of entities that
are dispersed through space on geographic scales. Examples include: plagues,
biological species, major world religions. The paper applies standard mereotopological
theories of spatial regions to agglomerations in this sense. It offers
the beginnings of a general theory of the relations between social, cultural,
ethnic and religious agglomerations on the one hand and territorially demarcated
spatial objects on the other. In this way it serves as the basis for a
general ontological theory of types of human groups and also of types of
conflict between these groups. At the same time it provides ontological
foundations for the epidemiological study of cognitive phenomena, and especially
of cognitive phenomena in the sociopolitical realm.</blockquote>
