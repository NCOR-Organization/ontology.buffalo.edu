There are, across the world, radically different institutions of landed
property, radically different ways of dividing up the space in which we
live, and radically different ways in which land and property rights interact
with other legal, economic and social institutions. These differences are
found not only when contrasting the treatment of landed property in industrialized
nations with those prevailing in, say, tribal cultures. They come to light
also when one pays attention to the sometimes subtle differences in policies
regarding landed property in different industrialized and semi-industrialized
nations.

<P>For the parcelling of land into real estate is not, as we might be tempted
to suppose, a simple geometrical affair. Real estate is a complex historical
product of interaction between human beings, legal and economic institutions,
and the physical environment. The space of real estate as such is thus
opposed to physical, geometrical, and even geographic space. The unique
character of real estate as the human space par excellence has been eloquently
summarized by Rousseau:

<P>The first person who, having fenced a plot of ground, took it into his
head to say <I>this is mine</I> and found people simple enough to believe
him, was the true founder of civil society.

<P>There are many theories concerning the origin of real estate. What we
might call the Rousseau-Hobbes theory asserts that real estate arises when
raw land is <I>fenced</I> and these fences are secured and policed via
state power. A more liberal view would assert that real estate is a function
of trust, mutual respect, existence of neighborly habits, and similar informal
social institutions. On the first view real estate is ontologically dependent
on police and state power; on the second view it is ontologically dependent
on certain customs and habits which might have existed even prior to the
existence of the state.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Importance of Landed Property</B>

<P>The fundamental importance of landed property, as opposed to other types
of property, flows from the fact that, without land, it is difficult (perhaps
impossible) to obtain credit, and without credit it is difficult for nations
and regions to develop. Land constitutes the most fundamental type of security,
a feature which turns on its non-perishability and on the fact that it
cannot be easily stolen, lost, destroyed, or counterfeited.

<P>The foundational role of land and of real estate in general --including
buildings-- is dictated also by the fact that all societies and all human
activities --not excluding sleep and death-- take up space, a resource
whose utilization is standardly subject to the pressure of demand by other,
competing users. Moreover, all societies and all human activities manifest
a spatial organization which varies systematically from culture to culture
and from age to age. There is only one space, which we all must share,
and compete with each other for the use of --each of us, in contrast, has
his own time. You and I can compete for the use of a given volume of space
in a way that we cannot compete for the use of a given stretch of time.
Stretches of space, moreover, can be embellished, can be added to and improved
upon, in a fashion which again does not apply to stretches of time. Stretches
of space can, above all, be bought and sold.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Need for a General Ontological Framework</B>

<P>Our analysis of land and real estate differs from existing investigations
in the following sense. It does not begin by addressing normative or political
or legal or economic issues pertaining to different institutions of landed
property across the globe. Rather, we seek to use the tools of ontology
to answer the question of what landed property is. More precisely, since
we do not wish to presuppose that there is only one answer to this question
which could be applied to all cultures and times, our investigation seeks
to provide a general ontological framework within which different institutions
of landed property (and of landed non-property) can be contrasted and compared.

<P>To be sure, existing analyses of property downright ignore the ontological
dimension of property. Consider the first few sentences of Andrew Reeve's
highly informative survey article on the philosophical dimensions of property:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Property undoubtedly has a central place in arrangements surrounding
social life, a place so central that some writers have claimed that it
is impossible to imagine anything which could be called a society without
some property institution. A moment's thought suggests that property is
a key element of an economic system, a major concern of the legal system,
and a focus of political dispute.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>

<P>This passage neatly captures the different perspectives from which property
is typically analyzed: political, legal, or economic. The sort of question
which an ontological analysis of landed property promotes is conspicuously
rare: What is a land parcel? What is the difference between a land parcel
and raw land? What is the difference between owning and possessing? These
foundational questions are ignored, and others (no doubt important) questions
are given preference: What is the justification of property rights? What
are the economic implications of this or that system of landed property?
It is our thesis the latter set of questions can be better understood after
the former set of question is analyzed.

<P>Those rare studies which have attempted to free the analysis of property
from the strictures of the political or legal or economic concerns, have
nevertheless been unable to develop a full-blown ontology of landed property.
First of all, these attempts do not distinguish sufficiently (sometimes
they do not distinguish at all) between landed property and other types
of property. But also, these attempts fail in that they fall squarely within
the very limits they try to expand. For example, Honore's analysis of ownership
(Honore, 1961) is still concerned with the concept of property as it is
found in highly developed legal systems.

<P>The general, ontological framework that we favor also provides a neutral
vocabulary for the discussion of normative and evaluative issues and for
unprejudiced and unblinkered comparison of different institutional and
cultural arrangements. Many cultural differences regarding the treatment
and conceptualization of space have never been analyzed scientifically.
Rather, such differences are presented as picturesque and somewhat amusing
tidbits. Edward T. Hall, for example, discusses interesting differences
between Western nations and their respective psychologies of space.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>
There are, he tells us, huge differences between British, German, and French
cultures regarding for example notions of intrusion, privacy, and order.
Hall uses these differences in an attempt to explain different habits regarding
the volume at which people speak, their patterns of eye movement, their
tones of voice when talking on the phone, their policies regarding behavior
on the threshold of offices or homes, and many other curiosities.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP>

<P>Such superficial differences in the ways in which different cultures
divide, categorize, and conceive space, point to more profound differences
in underlying spatial ontologies. Recent developments in geographic information
science and in other disciplines of cognitive science have begun to show
how the tools of ontology can be applied to a number of different aspects
of the spatial dimension of human experience.

<P>Investigations dealing in non-trivial fashion with issues of comparative
law, specifically dealing with issues of landed property, do of course
exist in the literature. But such legal approaches to our problem fail
too, for two distinct reasons. First, they overlook the cognitive and ontological
dimensions of landed property. Second, comparative legal approaches are
focused overwhelmingly on pragmatic interests of lawyers; they therefore
tend to underestimate theoretical distinctions and similarities; very rarely
do we encounter the attempt to establish a general theory of the institutions
compared. Most commonly legal comparative analyses are carried out with
forensic goals; they are comparable to travel guides, designed to allow
a lawyer from one culture to gain some vicarious familiarity with the legal
institutions and practices of another.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Ontology of Land</B>

<P>In attempting to construct a general ontology of land and real estate
we confront familiar issues pertaining to the nature of rights in general
and of property rights in particular. But we also encounter hitherto unnoticed
questions relating to the identity conditions of land parcels and associated
entities. We shall attempt to show that these and related questions can
usefully be addressed via the methods developed by ontologists in other
fields.

<P>Bentham has eloquently expressed the metaphysical nature of property:

<P>There is no image, no painting, no visible trait, which can express
the relation that constitutes property. It is not material, it is metaphysical;
it is a mere conception of the mind.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP>

<P>Yet, in spite of the obvious metaphysical import of property, few <I>metaphysical</I>
analyses of property, and even fewer metaphysical analyses of <I>landed</I>
property, have ever been attempted. When does a given land parcel begins
to exist? When is a given land parcel, at some given time, genuinely identical
with what is putatively the same land parcel at another time? How are our
answers to this and similar questions affected by the possibility of physical
change in the land itself, by political changes in the corresponding or
surrounding cultures, by change in occupancy of the land or in the claims
made upon it by others? Some of these issues, at least, have analogs in
more traditional philosophical issues pertaining to questions related to
the ontological status of works of art and other cultural entities, personal
identity, to ontological versus epistemological vagueness, to questions
of identity across possible worlds, etc.; some of them belong to a new
territory of the ontology of legal entities.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Landed Property and Sorites Paradoxes</B>

<P>The ancient Sorites paradoxes shed light upon a highly complex philosophical
issue: vagueness. The earliest Sorites paradoxes, attributed to Eubulides
of Miletus, consisted of puzzles aimed at showing how difficult it is to
fix a crisp boundary between the state of affairs whereby something is
properly described in one way, and that state of affairs in which this
description is no longer adequate. For example, with Eubulides, is a man
with one hair in his head a bald man? If yes, then is a man with two hairs
in his head a bald man? If yes, what about a man with three hairs, four
hairs, and so on until we have a man with two million hairs. At what point
does the man stop being bald? The solution to this paradox involves appealing
to sophisticated metaphysical and logical investigations.<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP>
Baldness is said, then, to be a vague concept, insofar as it is not clear
when someone is bald and when someone is not bald. There are many other
concepts which are vague as well, such as maturity, intentionality (of
actions), happiness, etc.

<P>Landed property is affected by vagueness in hitherto unexplored ways.
First, the concept of a property right in general --but more so (as shall
become clear) in the case of landed property in particular-- is itself
a vague concept. It is not clear when some state affairs whereby someone
has the capacity to interact with an object (a land-parcel, for example)
is properly characterized as illustrating someone holding a right, or merely
holding power over the thing. An important difference between property
and possession turns on the distinction between rights and powers, as we
shall see below. And this distinction is itself vague; after all, when
does a mere power become a right is often difficult to establish.

<P>Second, vagueness affects the very <I>collection</I> of rights which
constitute a property right. That is, how many --and which-- rights must
a person have in relation to a given land parcel, in order to be considered
the owner of the parcel. Say a person holds the right to use, to enjoy
the usufruct, and the right to subdivide a given land parcel, does this
person owns the parcel? Complex cases in which many rights over land parcel
are in the hands of one single person, yet he does not own it can be better
understood as instances of Sorites paradoxes.

<P>Third, some legal-technical concepts of 'land' are vague; houses, animals,
rights themselves, and other entities can sometimes be considered real
estate, in the legal sense. The crucial element in deciding whether something
counts as 'land' or not is whether or not the object can be moved or not.
The distinction between movables and immovables is itself vague; there
are, strictly speaking, no immovable objects. Of course, from the legal
perspective it is convenient, perhaps even necessary, to stipulate that
certain objects are immovable, land being the paradigmatic example. Yet,
the stipulatory, conventional nature of the distinction between movables
and immovables points in the direction of the vagueness of the distinction.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>On the Nature of Landed Property</B>

<P>Our goal, therefore, is to apply ontological methods to the comparative
study of policies of land ownership, registration, and demarcation around
the globe in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of land and
landed property.

<P>The space of landed property is, as we have called it, <I>human</I>
space. Real estate is a product of deliberate or intentional activity of
human beings.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP> Regarding this aspect,
parcels of real estate are indeed similar to works of art. Moreover, the
familiar distinction between aesthetically pleasing natural objects such
as sea shells and butterflies on the one hand and works of art on the other,
maps rather neatly onto that distinction between bare physical land and
real estate. Both works of art and real estate are the result of human
intervention: in the case of works of art it is creativity which sparks
the human intervention; in the case of landed property it is socio-economic
needs.

<P>The most primitive relationship between human beings and land (and for
that matter, between human beings and things in general) is that of <I>power
</I>(dominion, faculty, authority over). It is for the sake of the resulting
power over land that social groups become sedentary, that wars are fought,
and that nations are built. Of course, we can also have power over other
things which are not land, such as toothbrushes, guitars, books, pets,
and so on; but, in principle, nations are not built, and wars are not fought,
and nomadic way of life is not abandoned, for the sake of power over these
sorts of entities.

<P>Property can in first approximation be conceived, a la Hohfeld, after
the model of a bundle of sticks, each stick signifying a particular right,
a right to use, to possess, to sub-divide, to rent, to build upon, to enjoy
the usufruct from, and so on. An owner can, in certain cases, give away
specific rights, or see these rights removed, divided, or amended by the
force of others. Dealing with landed property in which the sticks have
dwindled or been transformed in this fashion can be a very complex matter.<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP>

<P>It is important to point out, however, that the property right itself
is in no way affected by the dwindling of the rights (or powers) that make
up the property right. As Reinach has eloquently put it:

<P>If property were a sum or unity of rights, it would be reduced by the
alienation of one of these rights, for a sum necessarily disappears with
the disappearance of all its parts. But we see that a thing continues to
belong to a person in exactly the same sense, however many rights he may
want to alienate; it makes no sense at all to speak of a <I>more</I> or
<I>less</I> with respect to belonging. The <I>nuda proprietas</I> in no
way means that the owning "springs back to life" once the rights transferred
to other persons have been extinguished; the thing rather <I>belongs</I>
to the owner in the interval in exactly the same sense as before and after...
This is the essential necessity which underlies the so-called "elasticity"
or "residuarity" of property and which can hardly be reasonably considered
as an "invention" of the positive law.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP>

<P>Each of the sticks that make up the property right can, in principle
at least, be the object of negotiations independently of the remaining
sticks in the general cluster, and whatever the outcome of such negotiations,
the property right remains --ontologically speaking-- intact. Someone can
give away some of the sticks without giving away the property over the
thing in question. Thus it is not uncommon, particularly in jurisdictions
(such as that of Japan, for example) affected by strict policies of rent
control, to see cases in which someone has given away virtually all sticks
in the bundle (in this case to a tenant with extensive and well-secured
rights) except the residual property right over the thing itself. This
is a peculiar situation, insofar as someone who has given away all or most
of the sticks seems to be in no relation with, to hold no power over, the
thing in question. What is the point of holding someone to be the owner
of a thing, if that someone has no substantive right over the thing, and
cannot use, sell, sub-divide, or possess it? Antarctica is, incidentally,
a somewhat analogous case in the plane of international law: its parts
are owned by separate nations, yet these separate nations are not allowed
to exploit the corresponding parcels of land in any way, since only scientific
research is permitted by treaty. (The Moon is, at this writing, subject
to similar treatment.)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Special Case of Property Rights in Land</B>

<P>It is not just in the case of land that property rights are properly
to be conceived as a complex, structured bundle. But two interconnected
reasons explain why it is specially in the case of landed property that
problems pertaining to the distribution of sticks are so important. First,
some of the sticks (or rather: some of the negotiations relating to the
sticks) make practical sense only in relation to landed property. Although
the owner of, say, a painting, has strictly speaking the right to sub-divide
it, it seems unlikely that he will ever seek to exercise this right. It
seems similarly odd to suppose that someone might give away the right to
use a washing machine or toothbrush for long periods of time while retaining
title to the goods in question. In most such cases it seems that when someone
gives away a specific stick from the bundle then he is actually giving
away the full right of property over the object in question. Second, it
is primarily in landed property cases where these maneuvers are commonly
carried out, precisely because there are here more sticks in the bundle.
And --because of what we have pointed out as the central economic importance
of land-- it is only in these cases that corresponding complex legal institutions
have grown up in reflection of the different dimensions of rights involved.

<P>Consider, for example, my property right over a watch: it is easy to
see that the bundle of sticks which comprise this property right, can only
with difficulty --and even then still only partially-- dwindle or be transformed.
Can we meaningfully talk about subdividing, or building upon a watch, or
harvesting the usufruct from? What purpose is served by giving away the
possession or the use of a watch while maintaining ownership over it? The
age-old aphorism "in movable goods possession presupposes property" is,
under this light, quite accurate. Most of the sticks in the bundle of rights
which constitute landed property are much more varied and complex than
in relation to other types of property. Leasing, time-sharing, owning shares
in a social club, borrowing, sub-dividing, using as collateral, and many
other practices are examples which demonstrate the range of possibilities
here.

<P>An important reason for the differences between landed property and
other types of property turns on the special character of the object itself
over which the property right applies. The idea of a parcel of land is,
as we shall see, in greater need of clarification than is, say, that of
a watch or lawnmower. The metaphysics of real estate must provide an account
not only of the precise make-up of the bundle of sticks which comprises
a property right in general, and of the structure of that rather problematic
entity which is a parcel of land, but it must also provide an account of
the interplay between these two --and this in such a way as to do justice
to different human cultures.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>The Nested Hierarchy of Land</B>

<P>A further reason for the special character of landed property as against
other sorts of property turns on the existence of neighbors. My land borders
your land which, in turn, borders someone else's land. Where land is brought
within a system of landed property this standardly involves a whole network
of persons and a corresponding partitioning of the land in such a way that
the property each person owns is anchored to the property of his neighbors,
in a reciprocal fashion that is peculiar to landed property.

<P>Another peculiarity of landed property turns on the phenomenon of spatial
nesting. This is illustrated in the simplest case by the renting of parts
or jurisdictions within a larger whole, for example of apartments within
a building. More complicated nesting occurs when whereby the simple relation
of ownership between a person and a thing in a Hobbesian state of nature
becomes transformed into a relationship involving what might be a nested
hierarchy of distinct institutions. For a complete account of our subject-matter
must deal also with the role of (local, regional, national) government
agencies at different levels, each of which is responsible for one or more
aspects of the land or property within the corresponding jurisdiction.

<P>Erik Stubkjaer presents an interesting study of what he calls the "socio-economic
spatial units" (SEU) relevant to Danish law. He distinguishes four main
types of SEU.

<P>1) A jurisdiction, of which the prototype is the nation or state.

<P>2) A place, exemplified by towns, market-places, squares and similar
entities.

<P>3) A region, exemplified by areas which are delineated, for example,
in view of scientific research.

<P>4) A district, exemplified by an area within which a public administrative
body is to fulfill its function.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP>

<P>All four of these categories have in common the fact that in each case
the SEU is defined in terms of a power relation of some sort to a person
or group of persons. Moreover, they also share the fact that SEUs are not
physical entities, they rather are, as Stubkjaer echoing Frank suggests,
"non-physical properties of an area which can be moved without any movement
of material"<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP> Note that real property
is distinguished from other SEUs, however, in the fact that it cannot be
(easily) moved. Later he claims "SEUs are not areas, they are SEU precisely
because they are determined by a societal as well as physical reality".
Stubkjaer considers, moreover, that real estate is a SEU:

<P>A real property has an area, it covers a section of the surface of the
Earth, but the essence of the real property is the relation between the
owner and the land: the domination, the cultivation, the base for living
[the <I>power</I>, in our terms]. Furthermore, without a society a person
would hold land in possession rather than own it.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP>

<P>As the case of Poland clearly shows that political and administrative
SEUs are spatial shadows cast on the surface of the earth by human activities
of certain special sorts. Parcels of landed property in contras are such
as to overlap with real segments of the earth and thus enjoy real physical
properties. They can move in certain special circumstances such as earthquakes,
but then only if there is genuine movement of material.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Different Sorts of Power Over Land</B>

<P>It is clear that the owner of the land has some power over it: it is
not clear, however, exactly in what this power consists. Other familiar
powers over land come to mind, such as, for example, the power that the
state has over land, even when that land is privately owned, or those powers
over land arising from someone having leased a given parcel of land. It
is not always easy to distinguish between these powers, insofar as they
have traditionally been viewed as belonging to the subject-matters of separate
disciplines. Morris Cohen, echoing Montesquieu has put it succinctly:

<P>Property and Sovereignty, as every student knows, belong to entirely
different branches of the law. Sovereignty is a concept of political or
public law and property belongs to civil or private law. This distinction
between public and private law is a fixed feature of our law-school curriculum.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP>

<P>The distinction between public and private law is so ingrained in contemporary
academic culture that our project of treating powers over land on an equal
footing, regardless of whether they arise in the public or private spheres,
will raise eyebrows in certain circles. If we are right, however, then
the foundations of real estate lie as much in the dimension of (different
kinds of) power over land as they do in the physical dimension of land
itself. Hence a general ontology of real estate will require in turn a
general theory of all of the specific powers that can obtain in different
cultures.

<P>Let us, then, focus upon that fundamental feature of landed property:
which is power over the land --and leave aside, for the moment at least,
contingent and a posteriori distinctions between powers or dominions of
different sorts. Moreover, the standard distinction between public and
private law will then be inconvenient for our purposes for two reasons.

<P>First, it is anachronistic, for such a wedge between the two realms
does not do justice to the state of affairs in earlier times. In feudal
Europe, for example, the distinction between powers over land that arose
from sovereignty and powers that arose from property <I>simpliciter</I>
was not clear at all. In fact, the very separation of sovereignty from
property is of importance for our purposes, not least because it helps
us to understand those cultures in which this separation has not yet taken
place. The inseparability of landed property from some form of what we
now would call public rights is acknowledged by Morris Cohen, for the case
of medieval England: "Ownership of the land and local political sovereignty
were [in this period] inseparable".<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP>
Legold, King of Belgium, <I>owned </I>Congo. Otto Brunner has analyzed
the cases of Austria and Germany at length:

<P>In Germany, as we like to say, the modern state developed at the level
of the individual territories, not at the level of the empire. German constitutional
historians trace these territories back to the late twelfth century, with
the appearance of the territorial lord or prince (the "<I>princepts terrae</I>"
or "<I>dominus terrae</I>")... A territorial prince's lordship, originally
a complex of diverse rights joined together in the hands of a lord, gradually
became a unified whole. Beginning around the fifteenth century, the prince
developed a unitary governmental power that transformed the medieval <I>territorium</I>
into the "territorial state" of the sixteenth century.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP>

<P>The complex of diverse rights that the medieval prince had was composed
of rights that we nowadays would consider to belong some to the sphere
of public and some to the sphere of private law. These rights we are here
calling powers, in tune with our attempt to get at the root of the issues;
the term 'right' is in more need of clarification than is the term 'power';
but more importantly, in different eras and in different cultures what
has been understood for property is more accurately described as a 'power'
than as a 'right'. (Rights, for example, indicate some sort of reciprocal
relation whereby other person has a corresponding duty, which is not always
present in all cultures or at all times.)

<P>Second, such a sharp distinction between the public and the private
spheres hinders the understanding of those non-Western ontologies of landed
property in which this distinction plays little or no role. (To this issue
we shall devote a section below.)

<P>In fact, a tension between unbridled allodialism on the one hand and
the tendency towards some form of (Marxist) abolition of private property
is visible in most cultures and in most eras. A general ontology of land
and real estate can help to ease and understand this tension. Brendan Edgeworth,
regarding the tension between allodialism and extreme governmental interference
over privately owned land in Anglo-Australian jurisprudence, has stated
the following:

<P>The feudal imagery of English constitutional theory postulated the sovereign
as the only true public person. As Michael Walzer describes it, "All other
men and women [are] private, limited in their function, dependent, members
of the body politic only because of the unifying role of the king" Ordinary
citizens, or, rather, subjects as they are more accurately and conventionally
termed in monarchical constitutional theory, are analogously in the sphere
of property law, mere "tenants" holding of a superior lord. The French
phrase captures the condition perfectly -- <I>Nulle terre sans signeur</I>,
no land is without an overlord.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>On the Distinction Between Rights and Powers</B>

<P>The distinction between a right and power needs to be analyzed further.
This is a difficult distinction, and some have even suggested that there
is no difference between these two concepts, or at least that the one must
be defined in terms of the other. Ockham, Spinoza, and Hobbes (and perhaps
Locke too), among many others, are all examples of this view. The convenience
of our strategy regarding our preference for 'powers' over 'rights' should
already be clear, particularly in light of the comparative approach we
espouse. But a further theoretical consideration must emphasize the fact
that this is indeed a necessary move.

<P>One of the most enlightening and valuable discussions of rights is Alan
R. White's.<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP> White tells us that rights
and powers are different in many respects (ad in so doing he expresses
his disagreement with the previous authors mentioned). White puts forth
six rather convincing arguments in support of his thesis that powers and
rights are indeed different --"both within and without the law".<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP>
Most of White's arguments hover around the idea that rights, unlike powers,
need to be <I>justified</I>, and it is upon this issue that e wish to focus.
White tells us that

<P>the notion of <I>power</I> goes with those of ability and of authority;
while the notion of <I>right</I> goes with those of entitlement and justification.
To ask what gives you the power to V is to ask what enables or authorizes
you to V; to ask what gives you the right to V is to ask you what entitles
you to V. Being given the length of X may enable, but cannot sensibly entitle,
you to discover or calculate the length of Y... Unlike rights, powers can
be great or feeble, failing or increasing, effective or ineffective. Rights
need a justification, whereas powers can be arbitrary.<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP>

<P>There are many occasions in which having a power over a thing and having
a right over that same thing overlap (occasions in which the two faculties
are almost indiscernible). Our thesis, however, is that powers tend to
be physical, whereas rights are more frequently based on more abstract
constructs. The physicality of powers explains why their holders are prone
to advertise, threaten, and even use physical force in order to protect
these powers. White, too, embraces this view, and he explains this difference
rather eloquently:

<P>A power is a bit of control over others, while a right is a bit of freedom
from the control of others. Sovereigns seek powers, while slaves seeks
rights. There is a sort of hierarchy with powers at the top and rights
at the bottom.<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP>

<P>Rights are, necessarily, a social construction, whereas powers are not.
(Strictly speaking, our investigation is concerned with property <I>powers</I>,
and not with property <I>rights</I>. Moreover, the expression 'property
rights', were we to press this issue hard enough, would be mistaken, insofar
as there are only property powers, whatever ensuing rights being always
ancillary to the powers.)

<P>A recent attempt to apply orthodox ontological tools to the analysis
of unorthodox entities is carried out by John Searle in his <I>The Construction
of Social Reality</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP> Searle opposes
brute facts to institutional facts. Brute facts are those facts which exist
independently of human conventions. Institutional facts are characterized
by the fact that, as a consequence of human convention, some power is being
given, taken away, or in some way transformed. Searle does not distinguish
between rights and powers; as a matter of fact, whenever he speaks of powers
in the realm of institutional facts he really means right in our sense.
After all, having a power, in our sense, is typically a matter of brute
facts. Searle claims, in any case, that the primitive term in the creation
of social reality is power (rights). This insight is extremely valuable,
and in our case it constitutes the cornerstone of our analysis of landed
property.

<P><B>Real and Personal Rights</B>

<P>The first building block in the ontology of real estate is constituted
by the distinction between real and personal rights. In spite of the differences
between institutions of property rights, some characteristics of property
rights in general are shared by each and every culture where property rights
exist at all. Thus, a property right always relates a person (or group
of persons) to a thing (or group of things). An ancient but still valuable
usage divides all rights into 'real' and 'personal'. Personal rights, also
known as obligations, relate one person to another person; examples of
rights of this sort are common: the right of an employer to demand work
from his employee, the right of a bank to demand payment from a debtor,
and so on. Real rights, in contrast, relate a person to a thing. Property
rights are, it should be clear, the paradigmatic example of real rights,
but other real rights would include rights of possession, and rights over
goods securing obligations.

<P>But to say that a real right links a person to a thing is slightly misleading.
Part of what is involved in this relation is a special sort of link between
this person and the rest of the universe of persons. If someone owns, say,
a watch, then everybody else is required by law and custom to respect the
exclusive rights of the watch-owner. In contrast to personal rights, other
persons are here not required to do anything in particular, but merely
to refrain from acting in certain ways. This brings forth an additional
peculiarity of landed property, insofar as the relevant requirement to
refrain from acting is in certain cultures substantially weakened: the
rest of the community is in some cases more and in some cases less strictly
required to abstain from violating the corresponding rights of owners.
Squatters everywhere, and agricultural workers in nations which have embraced
agrarian reforms attest vividly to this fact, as also do rights of way
(servitudes), bridlepath rights, and similar institutions. The usual rigid
exclusion rights that landowners have over their land parcels are in many
cases limited when they keep these land parcels idle; we shall investigate
the implication of such phenomena in the context of a discussion of the
agrarian reform. reforms attest vividly to this fact, as also do rights

<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Objects of Property Rights</H4>
The second building block in the ontology of real estate concerns the sorts
of things that can be the objects of property rights. In principle, anything
that can be negotiated can be the object of a property right. Reinach has
put it clearly:

<P>The concept of a thing [<I>Sache</I>] in no way coincides with that
of a bodily object, even if positive enactments would restrict it to this.
Everything which one can "deal" with, everything "usable" in the broadest
sense of the word, is a thing: apples, houses, oxygen, but also a unit
of electricity or warmth, but never ideas, feelings or other experiences,
numbers, concepts, etc.<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21)</A></SUP>

<P>Things are easily divided into movable and immovable. Land is the quintessential
immovable thing. The term 'real estate' then refers precisely to those
immovable things which are the objects of (real) rights.

<P>But, is land really immovable? For lawyers and legal scholars, this
question must surely seem absurd, and they will answer it without hesitation
in the affirmative. From a more sophisticated ontological perspective,
however, matters are here not so clear. For there is a range of types of
immovable things, a treatment of which will shed light upon the fictional
nature of legal (positive) immovability.

<P>The standard classification of immovables stipulates four types:

<P>1) <I>Immovables by nature</I>; the paradigmatic examples of which are
land-parcels, edifices (including buildings), and plants adhering to the
soil.

<P>2) <I>Immovables by destination</I>; here the best examples are agricultural
machinery, animals associated to cultivation, and so on. These are all
movable things that the law 'immobilizes' in order to account for the strict
relationship of dependence in which these objects stand to other objects
which are deemed immovables by nature.<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP>

<P>3) <I>Immovables by the object to which they are applied</I>; this category
pertains to <I>rights</I>. This is a bold fiction of the law, for as Planiol
points out "rights, being incorporeal are, strictly speaking neither movables
nor immovables. They are not tangible. They take up no room".<SUP><A HREF="#N_23_">(23)</A></SUP>
A classification of rights into movable and immovable can therefore be
made only by attending to the object to which the right applies. If the
right applies to an immovable thing, then the right is deemed immovable,
if the right applies to a movable thing then the right is deemed movable.

<P>4) <I>Immovables by declaration</I>; finally, the immovables by declaration
are the most fictional of all immovable things, insofar as their immovability
is just a consequence of an individual's wish. Someone may, for example,
just declare some specific good to be immovable (for example, someone may
declare artwork in her own house to be an immovable). There are stark differences
from country to country in the way that immovables by declaration are provided
for and dealt with.

<P>As can be clearly seen, the extent to which the immovability of these
objects depends on legal fictions varies considerably in these four general
cases. But it is hardly ever admitted that even in the case of land there
is an element of fiction involved in its putatively immovable nature, and
even in those rare cases where this element is indeed admitted, it is not
further investigated. Planiol, for example, refers to the immovable by
nature as follows:

<P>Strictly speaking, there is nothing which is absolutely immovable. Even
the elements which compose the soil, rocks, sand, minerals, may be displaced.
When a canal is dug, when lots are leveled it is the soil which is transported.
In America, engineers have displaced large buildings without demolishing
them. In Paris, the fountain <I>du Palmier</I> on the <I>Place du Ch&acirc;telet</I>
was set back in its entirety to permit the opening of the <I>Boulevard
de Sebastopol</I>. But the law does not envisage the possibility of movement
with the same rigor as mechanics. The law holds those things to be immovable
[by nature] which are <I>immovable in a durable and habitual manner and
whose function is to be immovable</I>, even if they may be displaced, in
some cases, by extraordinary means.<SUP><A HREF="#N_24_">(24)</A></SUP>

<P>Land moves, too, of course, with the movement of the earth (and our
ontology of land must take account of this fact if it is to do justice
to the extension of property rights in land to the moon and distant planets).
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Land Parcels As Multi-Layered Entities</B>

<P>A land-parcel is not a simple two-dimensional region delineated on the
surface of the earth: it is a three-dimensional solid which includes points
above and below the ground level. A land-parcel can deviate from simple
two-dimensionality also in the following sense: land is multi-layered in
the sense that there are ontologically distinguishable aspects of what
is, from a geometrical point of view identically the same territory. Thus
there are layers of geology, of archeology, of history and pre-history,
of ecology, of rights of way, and so on, and the state can own (or have
property rights in) some or all of these layers even in those circumstances
where a private person is the ostensible owner of the plot of land simply
conceived.

<P>The specification of the height and depth of the three-dimensional solid
differs again from culture to culture. In the United States, for example,
the owner of a given parcel of land in fact (and in law) owns a cone-shaped
portion of land projecting from the center of the earth and reaching as
far as the ear can hear. In other places these determinations are effected
in different ways. One of the specific prerogatives which the state has
in Latin America is that it owns the whole of the subsoil in the country,
no matter who owns the surface of the land. If someone owns a land-parcel,
and finds gold some few inches below the ground, this gold becomes the
property of the state. Of course, this presents us with the problem of
determining how to fix a boundary between the surface and the subsoil.
It seems odd, to say the least, that a hand-made hole of merely a few inches
constitutes a penetration in the state's exclusive property. Note, too,
that the problem, faced by even developed institutions of property law,
of providing a clear demarcation of the boundary between soil and subsoil
(as also between soil and aerial space), is analogous to the problem of
drawing a line between territorial and extraterritorial waters. The latter,
however, is similar in turn to the problem of providing a clear demarcation
between neighboring land-parcels or between neighboring political jurisdictions.
The former is an issue for collective resolution or fiat, the latter is
a case for <I>reciprocal</I> negotiations between the parties involved.
Collective fiat decisions can be made where no other parties are competing
for the use of the space involved (as in the case, for example, of the
sky above our heads).

<P>At the one extreme, a land parcel is a well-demarcated volume of land
with a maximal set of known, determinate property rights which are assigned
to a given individual (or group), and which are well-respected on all sides.
At the opposite extreme a land parcel is a zone, with one or more focal
points or focal areas at which customary rights are more or less firmly
assigned to some group, clan, or family (perhaps also to some local king,
baron or tribal chief); these <I>loci</I> are then surrounded by penumbral
areas in which the group's willingness to defend their rights, and outsiders'
propensity to acknowledge them, declines in rough proportion to the distance
from the focal points or centers. Most real-world cases fall between these
two extremes.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Registration of Land (Cadastral and Mercantile Registration)</B>

<P>The third building block in the ontology of real estate relates to the
issue of registration. The registration of land is of immense importance
for the ontological analysis of landed property in particular, whereas
the previous two aspects we have analyzed (the division of rights and the
division of objects) were important for property in general. There are
two important issues that a registry must establish: the exact boundaries
of a parcel, and the chain of successive transactions dealing with the
relevant property right (or some one or more of its constituent sticks).
In many cultures these two services are carried out by one single registry;
in other cultures the corresponding institution is only concerned with
recording the boundaries of land parcels in what then is known as a cadastral
registry. This may be centralized, as in continental European countries,
or widely dispersed (privatized) as in the United States. The growth of
the cadastral boundary systems standardly involves not only the reciprocal
establishment of boundary lines between pairs of neighbors, but also, and
hand in hand therewith, the development of nested administrative boundaries
of successively larger also with a system of nested at scales (sub-divisions,
neighborhoods, parishes, villages, counties, states, etc.).

<P>The registry that is concerned with documenting the legal history of
the transactions affecting each piece of land (the <I>traditio</I>) is
known as the registry of deeds, or mercantile registry. Some cultures --above
all Bedouin and gypsy cultures but also some sedentary aboriginal and tribal
groups-- do not have cadastral or deeds registration at all. (Some of these
cultures do not even have the institutions of buying and selling landed
property. What they do have is an issue to be addressed later.)

<P>Registration affects landed property in two different ways. First, it
serves as an aid to knowledge, both in establishing who owns a given parcel
of land and in establishing where a given parcel ends and another begins.
Second, registration has an ontological effect, for the existence of a
system of registration alters the institution of land itself, its status
and structure. The first function of registration contributes to avoiding
and resolving legal disputes, especially boundary-disputes. The second
function is little understood and has to do with the ontological notion
of dependence. Crudely put, some entities (planets, deserts, rocks) exist
independently of human conventions and stipulations, while others (the
international Date Line, the American Constitution, NATO, the pound sterling)
exist only in virtue of (are <I>ontologically dependent upon</I>) sometimes
highly complex systems of cognitive acts, beliefs, and expectations on
the part of human beings

<P>A land parcel, too, is an instituted entity of this latter sort, and
a land parcel with cadastral and mercantile registration is an entity of
a different type from what is putatively the same parcel of land without
these supporting agencies (as Wyoming, as a constituent state of the federal
union is an of a different type from the corresponding non-administered
tract of land). A land-parcel in the presence of a defective or unstable
or contested registry is likewise a different entity again.

<P>When land is bought, the registry of deeds presents not only who the
seller bought the land from, but also how the latter acquired that property,
and so on until the original granting of deeds (or some similar act or
deed) is reached. Each transaction which affects the property in question
must be registered. Highly efficient methods for keeping track of the succession
of transactions that take place are of crucial importance, particularly
when land serves as warranty or collateral for other obligations, and when
account has to be taken of the possibility of fraudulent behavior.

<P>The chronology of all the transactions concerning property in land must
go back as far as the first granting of ownership by the state (or emperor,
king, etc.). A chain of ownership cannot be left dangling in midair, as
it were, because each claim of ownership has to be referable back to a
<I>certification of origin</I>. This is a sort of axiom of foundation in
the theory of landed property. (Incidentally, it is only with respect to
claims of property in land that such a certification must be capable of
being made. Regarding movable things, in contrast, the age-old axiom "possession
presupposes property" settles the scores.)

<P>Anyone can claim to have a right over a given parcel of land by demonstrating
that there was at some point a mistake in that typically long chain of
transactions, and that therefore the land was wrongly sold, gifted, inherited,
and so on.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>Conclusion</B>

<P>A host of problems faced by many individual nations concerning their
slow domestic growth, as well as problems faced collectively by nations
concerning international credit allocation, arise at least partially from
the absence of a method for analyzing and evaluating differences in the
treatment of landed property. The metaphysics of real estate should help
us in the design of such a method. Some of the specific advantages that
this new branch of applied philosophy can yield include the development
of a spatial interlingua for knowledge-and-data-exchange in the domain
of land and landed property. The sophisticated categorial systems with
which metaphysicians are familiar should help reveal the deficiencies and
the advantages of different systems of landed property, and therefore it
should be crucial in the identification and resolution of structural inefficiencies
currently endemic in the work of domestic and international credit institutions.
Moreover, the metaphysics of real estate should lead to new insights concerning
the necessary and universal characteristics of a philosophically viable
theory of landed property.
