<p>From: <i>Philosophical Psychology</i>, 7/2 (1994), 225-244.</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Introduction</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the works of Aristotle or of the medievals,
as also in the writings of later common-sense philosophers such as Thomas
Reid or G. E. Moore, we find a family of different attempts to come to
grips with the structures of common sense and of the common-sense world
that is given to us in normal, pre-theoretical experience. We shall argue
in what follows that the theory of such structures provides an important
and hitherto unappreciated link between early Gestalt psychology on the
one hand and contemporary developments in philosophy and in artificial
intelligence research on the other.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The notion of providing an adequate theory
of the common-sense world has been taken seriously of late above all by
those, such as Patrick Hayes or Kenneth Forbus, who see in such a theory
of what they call `naive' or `qualitative physics' the foundations of future
practical successes in robotics.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> This
naive physics is, however, like cognitive science in general, in a state
of flux, and a serious philosophical investigation of its presuppositions
and achievements has hardly been attempted. Yet it is already at this stage
possible to point to a certain apparent defect or one-sidedness of current
research in this field that is due to the predominant assumption that it
is set theory and related instruments of ontology that are to provide the
basis for naive-physical theorizing. The defect arises, we shall suggest,
in virtue of the fact that naive physicists working in the A.I. sphere
are for obvious reasons concerned with certain specific sorts of formal
implementations. Their motivations are in the first place pragmatic, and
so their aim is not so much a theory of the common-sense world that could
be defended as being <i>true,</i> but rather a theory that has certain
sorts of practical advantages from the point of view of implementation.
Both of these factors, we shall argue, lead the naive physicists to neglect
important detailed contributions to the theory of common sense that have
been made by both psychologists and philosophers, contributions which it
will be the business of the present paper to describe.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">What will be surprising to those who are
acquainted mainly with the standard artificial intelligence literature
on the topic of naive or commonsensical physics is the extent to which
it is among the Gestalt psychologists, above all, that some of the most
important and original work in this respect is to be found. Indeed one
could argue that the Gestalt-theoretical approach to external reality is
in its entirety a variety of naive physics, something which is brought
out clearly for example in the pronouncements of Wolfgang K&ouml;hler to
the effect that there seems to be `a single starting point for psychology,
exactly as for all the other sciences: the world as we find it, na&iuml;vely
and uncritically'. Our naive experience, as K&ouml;hler points out, `consists
first of all of objects, their properties and changes, which appear to
exist and to happen quite independently of us' (1947, p. 1, 2). We can
compare, on this very issue, Gibson:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Some thinkers, impressed by the
success of atomic physics, have concluded that the terrestrial world of
surfaces, objects, places, and events is a fiction. They say that only
the particles and their fields are "real" . . . But these inferences from
microphysics to the perception of reality are thoroughly misleading. The
world can be analyzed at many levels, from atomic through terrestrial to
cosmic. There is physical structure on the scale of millimicrons at one
extreme and on the scale of light years at another. But surely the appropriate
scale for animals is the intermediate one of millimeters to kilometers,
and it is appropriate because the world and the animal are then comparable.
(1966, p. 21f)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">It is this intermediate world, the world of
common sense, which will be our concern in what follows.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">I. GESTALT THEORY AND THE HISTORY OF
NAIVE PHYSICS</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Avenarius and Mach</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A full treatment of <i>theories </i>of
common sense would have to deal with Aristotle and the Scholastics, with
work on early physics in the spirit of Pierre Duhem, with Galileo's presentations
of the received physical theory he then criticizes, with Thomas Reid and
the Scottish school of common sense. Our story, however, shall begin with
Richard Avenarius and Ernst Mach, both of whom explicitly sought a view
of the world as this is directly given in perception. More precisely, Avenarius
and Mach operate with a notion of `pure perceptions', which is to say,
perception conceived as having been stripped of those metaphysical ingredients
(for example ideas about absolute space and time) which, as they conceived
matters, are illegitimately imported into our experience. The `natural
concept of the world', on Avenarius' view, `is that general concept we
all have about the world in its entirety before any exposure to philosophy':</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman">Intrinsic to the natural concept
of the world is the unshaken belief that all the component parts of my
environment exist and develop, change or remain constant, in interaction
with one another, in some form of stable regularity, all independently
of my observing them or not observing them. (Scanlon 1988, p. 220f.)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman">The matter was approached from another, complementary
standpoint by Mach, who sought to found the science of physics on a purified
world-view along lines similar to those considered by Avenarius to show
how physical science can grow, as it were organically, out of common-sense
experience. Mach's ideas in this respect formed part of the background
of Einstein's work on the theory of relativity, but the biological approach
to knowledge which Mach and Avenarius shared the idea that <i>theory</i>
should evolve naturally from out of the ground of ordinary experience anticipated
also the work of the Gestalt psychologists and certain aspects of the ecological
ideas we find in Gibson.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Like all their forerunners, however, neither
Mach nor Avenarius has any notion of a <i>separate</i> <i>discipline</i>
of naive physics of the sort that is at issue in current artificial intelligence
research. Moreover both allowed their respective images of reality to become
infected with doctrines of elementarism and of neutral monism of a metaphysical
sort. Thus their attempts to protect their views of `pure perception',
etc., against alien impurities were not, in the end, completely coherent.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">K&ouml;hler, Lipmann, Bogen</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Wolfgang K&ouml;hler was influenced both
directly and indirectly by Mach,<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3) </a></sup></font><font face="Times">and
it is in fact in the correspondence of K&ouml;hler that there appears what
is perhaps the first occurrence of the term `naive physics'.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)
</a></sup>In
his <i>The Mentality of the Apes</i>, a work whose original German text
dates back to 1917, K&ouml;hler points out that</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">psychology has not yet even begun to investigate
the physics of ordinary men [<i>Physik des naiven Menschen</i>], which
from a <i>purely biological standpoint</i>, is much more important than
the science [of theoretical physics] itself (K&ouml;hler 1921, p. 149).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">As K&ouml;hler makes clear:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">not only statics and the function of the
lever, but also a great deal more of physics exist in two forms, and the
non-scientific form constantly determines our whole behaviour. (With experts,
of course, this is saturated in all stages by physical science in the <i>strict</i>
sense.) (K&ouml;hler, <i>loc. cit.</i>)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">K&ouml;hler's ideas were worked out in detail in application
to the different levels of intelligence manifested by school-children by
the Berlin Gestalt psychologists Otto Lipmann and Hellmuth Bogen in a work
entitled <i>Naive Physik</i>, published in 1923. The latter comprises first
of all a theoretical investigation of the nature and scope of naive physics
itself, which is seen by Lipmann and Bogen as a capacity for intelligent
action in relation to everyday tasks and objects. There follows then a
summary of the results of experimental work on naive-physical beliefs about
causality and natural law and on the relation between such beliefs and
corresponding actions of children of different levels of intelligence.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Interestingly, Lipmann and Bogen see naive physics
as a true, and therefore useful, discipline. Thus they argue that children
should be trained in naive physics (where many later psychologists have
been interested, rather, in those naive-physical beliefs which stand out
as being <i>false).</i><sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">Gibson</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">J. J. Gibson's investigation of the world of basic
affordances for human action consists in the attempt to establish a new
descriptive standpoint which would pick up `facts at a level appropriate
for the study of perception'. Such a level is <i>prima facie</i> set against
standard mathematical physics and related disciplines which are concerned
with `the atomic and cosmic level of things' and leave out everything in
between.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Gibson, however, is confident that these intermediate
level facts `are <i>consistent</i> with physics, mechanics, optics, acoustics,
and chemistry', being only `facts of higher order that have never been
made explicit by these sciences and have gone unrecognized'. (1986, p.
17) Hence in contrast to the position of Galileo or Locke as concerns the
world that is given in common-sense experience it is possible to develop
a <i>realist</i> theory of the given facts, and this in a manner which
does not involve the rejection of standard quantative physics. Gibson terms
`ecology' the discipline that should encompass these higher-order facts;
it is presented as `a blend of physics, geology, biology, archeology, and
anthropology, but with an attempt at unification' on the basis of the question:
what can stimulate the organism? (1966, p. 21)</font>
<p><font face="Times">Gibson acknowledges a `debt to the Gestalt psychologists,
especially to Kurt Koffka' whose ideas in shaping this new, intermediate
level of description Gibson sees himself as having extended (in this connection
he mentions also Katz, Michotte, Hochberg, Metelli and Johansson). This
Gestaltist setting shows up most interestingly in Gibson's <i>nomenclature
for surface layout</i>, whose basic concepts we shall meet again in our
thematic section below. These concepts apply to what Gibson calls <i>surface
geometry,</i> a discipline which stands to naive physics in something like
the same relation in which the more familiar varieties of abstract geometry
stand to physics in the standard quantitative sense.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">The Austro-Italian School of Gestalt Theory</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">In some respects parallel to the Berlin Gestalt tradition
of K&ouml;hler and Wertheimer is the work of the Graz school around Alexius
Meinong (under whom Ehrenfels had studied in Vienna). Meinong's own "On
the Origins of our Knowledge in Experience" of 1906 contains ideas on the
world of external perception which then influenced Fritz Heider's work
on "Thing and Medium" to be discussed below. The Graz school was translated
through Meinong's assistant Vittorio Benussi to Italy, where subsequent
generations of Gestalt psychologists have made a number of serious contributions
to our problem.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">Some of the very first <i>experimental</i> work on
naive physics was performed by the Italian Gestaltist Paolo Bozzi in the
late '50s, in a manner which recalls earlier work by Michotte on the perception
of causality. Bozzi's subjects were asked to select, from a range of more
or less artificially constrained cases, which movement of a pendulum looked
most natural. As he recalls in his autobiographical book <i>Naive Physics</i>,<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)
</a></sup>such
experiments were partly inspired by a study of the naive conceptions of
the Aristotelian spokesman Simplicio in Galileo's <i>Dialogue</i>, Bozzi's
idea being that these earlier `naive' views of physical reality reflect
or are influenced by the ways in which we are disposed perceptually to
organize the physical reality we see.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10) </a></sup>There
is, according to Bozzi, a holistic interwovenness of experienced qualities
of objects and of certain physical conceptions we have of them. Qualities
such as force, agency, resistance, harmony, equilibrium, etc. can thus
be seen to play a primary role in perceptual organization.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">Phenomenology</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The phenomenologists, too, concerned themselves in
systematic ways with the idea of a science of common-sense experience.
As the cultural anthropologist R. M. Keesing points out (1987, p. 375):
`much of phenomenology (Husserl, Schutz, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) is precisely
about models of everyday cognition'. Further, it is well known that there
was an important interplay, both personal and theoretical, between the
phenomenological and Gestaltist movements, whose respective members shared
also a wide spectrum of common sources. Our investigations here will to
some extent be concentrated in the areas of this interplay and more precisely
still in relation to the work of Husserl, Schapp and other early phenomenologists.
A complete treatment would however need to consider also the important
contributions of Merleau-Ponty and of Heidegger to our understanding of
the phenomenology of common sense.</font>
<p><font face="Times">It is Husserl's <i>Crisis of European Sciences</i>,
above all, which addresses in explicit philosophical fashion the problem
of the relation between the ontology of the common-sense world called by
Husserl the `theory of the structures of the life-world' and pre- and post-Galilean
physics. As Husserl points out (<i>Crisis</i>, p. 65), one reason for the
neglect of the naive and of the commonsensical in the history of philosophy
has been that, due above all to the influence of Plato, philosophy wanted
always to be <i>episteme</i>, and not <i>doxa, </i>turning up its nose
at the latter not merely because it is unscientific but also (with less
apparent justification) because it is not itself capable of serving as
the <i>object</i> of a scientific treatment. The task of phenomenology,
now, Husserl sees as being that of harmonizing the naive and the exact
(of understanding the relation between the common-sense world and its various
outgrowths and extensions in particular in the realm of science). In our
thematic treatments of different sub-areas of naive physics below we shall
return to Husserl's view of things, cause and change, and consider also
the contributions of other thinkers on the borderlines of phenomenology
and Gestalt psychology to our understanding of the detailed structures
of naive-physical reality.</font>

<p><b><font face="Times">II. NAIVE PHYSICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Times">Historical Antecedents</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The basic approach of the A.I. naive physicists is
to take a sampling of deductive inferences from a given domain and to see
how formal languages can be developed in which the relevant knowledge can
be axiomatically expressed and the relevant inference procedures formally
captured. Such work has historical antecedents in the so-called `mathematical
philosophy' that was initiated by Whitehead in a ground-breaking paper
entitled "On Mathematical Concepts of the Material World" and published
in 1906. This mathematical philosophy was then pursued in some of the early
writings of Bertrand Russell, but it was developed most systematically
by Stanisaw Leniewski and his disciples, in Poland and elsewhere, who constructed
a range of precise and rigorous formal-ontological theories of those general
concepts which lie at the heart of common sense concepts such as time,
space, part, whole, relation, quality, and so on. These include the formal
theories of part and whole developed by Leniewski himself;<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)
</a></sup>the
work of Karl Menger Jr. on naive topology, of Carnap, Becker, Nicod, etc.
on the relation between `physical' and `intuitive' geometry and on the
question as to whether visual space is or is not Euclidean in structure.
They include the investigations of Eino Kaila, which seek to establish
the specific nature of the properties appropriate to each of the three
domains of `sensory phenomena', of `physical bodies' and of `physico-scientific
reality' and which draw not only on Carnap and others in the Vienna Circle
but also on K&ouml;hler.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12) </a></sup>And they include
the formal theories of temporal and biological concepts developed by Woodger,
and the various systems of realistic formal ontology that have been developed
on a Leniewskian or Husserlian basis in subsequent decades. Such theories
have left their mark, in different ways, on the corpus of literature in
analytic philosophy and logic upon which the A.I. naive physicists have
drawn. Yet the original version sof these theories have been largely neglected
because they do not fall squarely within the Frege-Russell-inspired logical
tradition which the A.I. community, for reasons hinted at above, has taken
as its standard. Most importantly, they differ from the Frege-Russell tradition
in adopting as the basis of their formal-ontological theories not the abstract
and mathematically problematic theory of sets but rather the simple and
more commonsensical theory of parts and wholes or `mereology'.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times">Critique of Artificially Intelligent Naive Physics</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The work of the Gestaltists, of Gibson, and of the
early phenomenologists has the aim of providing an adequate realist theory,
a <i>science </i>or <i>ontology</i> of the common-sense world which will
be consistent in principle with sophisticated theories of cognition and
of standard physical reality. Such work presupposes that there is, as it
were, a stable intermediate level or region of reality which it is possible
to describe, realistically, within the framework of a rigorous theory.</font>
<p><font face="Times">When we turn to the field of artificial intelligence,
however, then we find that there are at least three distinct aims which
have determined the nature of the relevant research, and this in ways which
bear witness to an important equivocation in the notion of `common-sense
reasoning' which lies at the heart of the A.I. programme. For common-sense
reasoning can mean:</font>
<p><font face="Times">(1) formally rigorous and precise reasoning about
the world of common sense (reasoning on the properly theoretical level
about the world that is grasped pre-theoretically);</font>
<p><font face="Times">(2) reasoning as actually practised by humans in
their everyday, non-theoretical lives;</font>
<p><font face="Times">(3) a philosophically motivated <i>reconstruction</i>
of either (1) or (2).</font>
<p><font face="Times">Sadly, the manifest tension between these three conceptions
is far from having been successfully resolved in the A.I. literature. For
each gives rise to a different sort of aim on the part of those engaging
in naive-physical research:</font>
<p><font face="Times">(1) gives rise to a drive toward a realistic formal
ontology, toward precise and rigorous theories of the concepts at the heart
of common-sense, such as have been attempted in different ways by Hayes
<i>et
al</i>. and by formal ontologists in the traditions of Lesniewski, Husserl<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)
</a></sup>or
Thom<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>;</font>
<p><font face="Times">(2) gives rise to the desire to <i>simulate</i> everyday
reasoning i.e. to construct inference-engines which would reconstitute
in the computer precisely that lack of sophistication which is characteristic
of our commonsensical thought-processes;</font>
<p><font face="Times">(3) gives rise to the drive to reconstruct some more
or less simplified analogues of the relevant families of commonsensical
concepts on the basis of non-commonsensical but logically more tractable
notions imported from elsewhere.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Our aim, here, is to sketch the history of naive
physics concentrating especially on attempts to produce realistic theories
of the naive-physical world. As the work of Hayes, above all, makes clear,
this drive towards realistic theory is certainly present in the A.I. literature.
It is illustrated, for example, in the following passage from a recent
textbook on common-sense reasoning and naive physics by Ernest Davis, who
points out that certain otherwise attractive primitives have to be rejected
from A.I. theories because:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">They do not correspond to anything much
in the real world; they are arbitrary distinctions made by us, as theory
builders, for the purpose of making axioms cleaner and shorter. As a result,
our representation becomes less a description of the relations in the world
and more a matter of logic programming. (1990, p. 206)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">On the other hand however, and in conflict with this
realistic drive, is first of all the desire of AI research on common sense
to achieve faithfulness to common-sense <i>reasoning</i> via the development
of theories which would themselves employ inference-patterns mimicking
those of common sense. Yet the latter is clearly not precise and rigorous,
and it seems clear that a sophisticated theory of the common-sense world
(or indeed of common-sense reasoning) can be produced only in ways which
involve going beyond those crude processes of reasoning which serve our
everyday human purposes. This problem is compounded still further when
account is taken of the fact that this common-sense reasoning seems not
to follow standard patterns at all, much less the deductive patterns captured
by extensional first-order logic and by those of its close cousins exploited
in the standard A.I. literature.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">The drive toward realistic ontology suffers most
importantly however from the fact that A.I. naive physics is in its actual
practice all too often willing to substitute more familiar artefacts of
its chosen logical machinery for the treatment of common-sense concepts
themselves in strict and realistic fashion. Thus Davis, for example, takes
it for granted that the appropriate way to analyze `Calvin is in the living
room' lies via the shamefacedly counter-commonsensical set-theoretic translation
into: `the set of spatial points making up the region occupied by Calvin
is a subset of the set of points making up the living room' (1990, p. 248).
Similarly he suggests that in order to express an assertion pertaining
to family relations for example: that Tom bears the same relation to Dick
as Bruno bears to Fritz it is necessary to conceive such an assertion as
amounting to an assertion to the effect that &lt;Tom, Dick> and &lt;Bruno,
Fritz> are both members of a certain set of ordered pairs (1990, p. 8).
Such translations are an artifice of logic; and they are as far removed
from common-sense ontology as they are from the representation of common-sense
reasoning as this exists in actual reality. It is out contention, further,
that the use of set-theoretic machinery here is an example of a quite general
tendency to reductionism in modern A.I. naive physics which runs counter
to the very project of naive physics as a discipline which rests on the
idea that it is possible to take certain macrophysical descriptions of
the world <i>at face value.</i></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Times">III. BRANCHES OF NAIVE PHYSICS</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Times">The task of naive physics, which is that of establishing
an adequate theory of the structures and relations caputred in such descriptions,
is for a variety of reasons not an easy one. Hayes, above all, has stressed
the extent to which the concepts of naive physics are subject to a massive
holistic interconnectedness in the sense that each is intervolved with
all the others in ways which make it difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish
distinct and separable branches of the discipline at hand. (Hayes 1979,
175ff) One should speak instead, he argues, of only loosely discriminable
conceptual clusters, bearing in mind always that the concepts in each cluster
are capable of being understood only by appeal to concepts in other, neighbouring
clusters. One partial and provisional list of such sub-branches of the
discipline might read as follows:</font>
<p><font face="Times">1. Objects, Natural Units and Natural Kinds</font>
<p><font face="Times">2. Events, Processes and Causality</font>
<p><font face="Times">3. Stuffs, States of Matter, Qualities</font>
<p><font face="Times">4. Surfaces, Limits, Boundaries, Media</font>
<p><font face="Times">5. Motivation, Requiredness, Value</font>
<p><font face="Times">The first four of these are standard (compare e.g.
the list supplied by Hayes 1979, pp. 187-97). The fifth, however, which
derives from phenomenology and from the Gestalt-theoretical perspective
on naive-physical reality, is non-standard, in the sense that phenomena
of value are not normally classed as belonging to `physics' in either the
naive or sophisticated senses.</font>
<p><font face="Times">In what follows we shall sketch a range of illustrative
examples of early contributions to the field of naive physics. These early
contributions are unaffected by the predominance of the desire to achieve
(`quick and dirty') formal representations: they are contributions to the
sophisticated and non-reductionistic theory of common sense, rather than
contributions to the computerized representation thereof. On the other
hand however these early contributions remain in many cases at the level
of isolated insights and much of the work of combining them into a full
and adequate theory has still to be done. In our remarks in what follows
we shall proceed always in keeping with the spirit of a realistic ontology.
Thus we shall take the world of common sense as serving at one and the
same time as (1) an object of a sophisticated theory and also (2) as that
to which we have ready access in straightforward and non-theoretical everyday
experience. For as already Avenarius (in his fashion) saw, naive physics
is part of an answer to the question: what do we (straightforwardly) perceive?
What, then, are the branches of the theory of the world of straightforward
perception?</font>
<p><b><font face="Times">1. Objects, Natural Units and Natural Kinds</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The common-sense world is from the formal-ontological
perspective first of all a world of things, of stable material bodies that
are given to us <i>as</i> things in the sense that they are given as inert,
as complete and as three-dimensional. Each thing is present in the flesh,
as something which has surfaces and an inside, that is filled with matter.
Things are perceived also as manipulable units, and as potential subjects
of fragmentation (splitting, cutting) and of unification (gluing, bonding).
The articulation of the world of things now follows along natural lines:
objects inanimate as well as animate are grouped together according to
their typical patterns of behaviour and qualitative determination into
<i>natural
kinds</i>. The common-sense world is further such that in all its spheres
and dimensions we can distinguish what is `normal' and what is to a greater
or lesser degree `abnormal'. Thus the natural kinds in commonsensical reality
have both standard and non-standard instances. Both Gestaltists and phenomenologists
have insisted from the start further on the <i>optimality </i>of perceived
objects; even where the objects themselves are marked by various deviations
from the norm, there is a tendency to discount such deviations in our straightforward
experience of things and in our assignment of things to kinds or categories
(a notion linked also to Mach's principle of the `economy of thought',
as also to the familiar phenomenon whereby even the scientific image of
reality must in every case be rooted in the categories of common sense<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>).</font>
<p><font face="Times">There is normal and abnormal also among experiences
and among the <i>conditions </i>of experience. Consider, for example, the
ways in which colour-appearances differ under different lighting conditions.
`Normal', here, is</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">seeing in sunlight, on a clear day, without
the influence of other bodies which might affect the colour appearance.
The `optimum' which is thereby attained then counts as the <i>colour itself,</i>
in opposition, for example, to the red light of the sunset which `outshines'
all proper colours. (Husserl 1952, p. 59)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">In normal experience, then, we take ourselves as having
access to the things themselves and to their real states. Other appearances
are taken by common sense as secondary to or as deformations of that optimal
appearance which alone counts as an appearance of reality. `The features
which pertain to the thing ``itself'' are the ``optimal'' ones. This applies
to all features, to the geometrical as well as to the sensuous qualities.'
(Husserl 1952, p. 76f.)</font>
<p><font face="Times">All families (kinds, species) of objects in the common-sense
world are subject to the opposition between normal (standard, typical)
and abnormal (non-standard, non-typical) instances.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">And the normal instances of such species are marked
by familiarity, they are <i>understood</i> by common sense, both in regard
to what they are and also in regard to what they will do (in regard to
their regular patterns of behaviour in normal and regular circumstances).
Thus I grasp a door, or a leaf, <i>in one stroke</i>, and I know already
the sorts of future ways in which this thing will behave.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">2. Events, Processes and Causality</font></b>
<p><font face="Times"><b>The common-sense world of material entities is
bicategorial</b>: in spite of certain revisionary attempts on the part
of Whitehead (1929), Kotarbinski (1955), Quine (1960, &sect; 36), and others
traces of which appear in Hayes' treatment of <i>histories</i> (1979, p.
189ff, 1985a) we still find it necessary to insist that common sense takes
material objects and processes/events as belonging to two utterly different
though interdependent categories.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">The work of the Polish phenomenologist Roman Ingarden
(1935, 1964/65/74) includes what is probably the most detailed bicategorial
ontology of things and processes/events to date, regarding processes as
extended in time and events as boundaries (beginnings, endings or crossings)
of processes. He thus stands opposed not only to monocategorial ontologies
in the spirit of Kotarbinski or Quine but also to the Whiteheadian conception
of processes as series of events. The Ingardenian classification can be
supplemented by those which one finds in Thom (on confluences and convergences
of processes, etc.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>). Thus instantaneous
events can be sub-divided into culminations (a sudden turn) and achievements
(a victory). A widely exploited analogy (e.g. Bach 1986, Galton 1984) is
that between instantaneous events and unitary things on the one hand and
between processes and masses or stuffs on the other. Thus processes (of
growth or disintegration) are like stuffs in that they can be divided into
parts which are themselves processes.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Mention must be made in this connection also of the
Gestaltists' work on process/event perception in the tradition of Gibson
and G. Johansson. Thus Cutting (1981) sets out a number of conditions on
event perception, which can also be taken as salient features of events
themselves. An event or process if it is to be salient (to be discriminated
as this or that event within a whole dynamic situation) must have an underlying
invariant structure of properties that does not change (this might be the
shape of the object involved, for example). These invariants concern both
the whole event and also parts thereof, and they are hierarchically organized
in the sense that some are essential, others inessential or such as to
depend upon the former, essential properties. Each whole dynamic situation
has one or more centre, for example the fulcrum of an acting lever, which
are picked up and tracked in perception.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times"><b>The common-sense world is causally organized</b>
-- as was recognized for example by Husserl, whose account of the common-sense
world put forward in his 1952 is built around the two central notions of
<i>cause</i>
and
<i>change. </i>To know a thing, Husserl argues, is to know its causal
dependencies: it is to know how it will change under given influences,
how it will behave when heated or bent. But it is to know also in what
respects it will remain the same through given series of changes, and it
is part of our common-sense understanding of reality that its denizensa
re such as to manifest a limited repertoire of systematic regularities
in this respect, in the sense that under similar circumstances similar
series of changes occur.</font>
<p><font face="Times">There are different sorts of change in the realm
of common sense. Thus for example there is change that is <i>internal</i>,
as e.g. when a person gets angrier of his own accord. Cases of this sort
can be contrasted with changes caused by external circumstances, for example
when a thing is dented or bruised. Changes can be divided further into
changes in mere appearance (as when objects appear lighter through a change
in external lighting conditions) and real changes (as when the apple ripens
or a piece of metal expands).</font>
<p><font face="Times">Our bodies, too, of course are involved in causal
dependencies, and yield the most important family of examples of real change,
both internal and external. The body is a thing in space, with its form
(extension) and its stock of qualities. The system of causalities into
which my body is interwoven in normal experience is moreover such that
my body retains <i>an identity of type and of function </i>through all
its changes. Thus my limbs return again and again to the same basic positions.
They can again and again accomplish the same sorts of things (lifting,
turning, running) in the same sorts of regular ways. (Cf. Husserl 1952,
pp. 61, 73)</font>
<p><font face="Times">Among the most important changes in the body, now,
are those changes we call sensory perceptions. The network of sensory changes
in the body is interwoven with other networks of changes, above all with
changes of position and orientation, and more generally with the body's
movements. Husserl in fact anticipates here the later position of J. J.
Gibson (as also of Merleau-Ponty and others) concerning the necessary interwovenness
of perception as a naturally occurring phenomenon with bodily movements
on the part of the perceiving subject.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">3. Stuffs, States of Matter, Qualities</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The world of experience is characterized by the fact
that it has a qualitative aspect: its basic unities (things) are in such
and such qualitative states and are filled through and through by sensory
qualities. Not everything that we perceive is a thing. We perceive also
the gaps between things,<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22) </a></sup>holes,<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)
</a></sup>the
media (for example water, smoke) in which things move, and we can perceive
holograms as well as rainbows and similar phenomena.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Things, now, are in common-sense experience spontaneously
correlated with discriminable areas of organization within the continuum
of what is given in sensory experience. Within this continuum centres are
picked out, centres of accumulation of sensory qualities (where accumulation,
here, is to be understood in the usual topological sense<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>).
As Husserl pointed out, when we perceive a thing, then we perceive also
sensuous qualities. But the latter are not there as it were <i>alongside</i>
the physical thing; what is there before us is a unity, something which
has physical and sensible properties as one. Moreover, the different strata
of sensible properties are themselves bound intimately together: the things
we experience are not built out of separate or separable seen, heard and
touched constituents. Rather, there is but one thing, along with its properties,
`some of which are predominantly or exclusively (as, e.g., colours and
their distinctions) grasped by vision, others by touch.' (Husserl 1952,
p. 70)</font>
<p><font face="Times">The multidimensional sensory continuum with its various
centres of accumulation is marked further by the feature of extension.
Everything that belongs to a material thing is related as a matter of essence
to its extension. Extension is, as it were, the axial determination of
the thing. Whatever other determinations the thing has, both as a whole
and in its parts, it has these determinations across the whole relevant
extent they fill its corporeal space. (Cf. Husserl 1952, p. 30). Thus the
coloration of an opaque thing covers the entire outer surface of the corporeal
thing in its specific fashion. Warmth fills the warm body in another, quite
different fashion, and matters are different again as concerns hardness,
texture, weight, and so on.<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">The complexity of the relationship between colour
and extension was hinted at already by Hering (1905), who talks of colour
as a sort of primitive stuff. Bits of this stuff, he holds, are colour
expanses, three-dimensional entities which are made up of colour as such
(an idea taken up again by Quine in his <i>Word and Object</i> (&sect;
19) via the thesis that colour terms are mass terms). In his 1911 David
Katz puts forward a taxonomy of the modes of appearance of colour <i>in
space</i> which are in fact modes of diffusion or filling of space by different
sorts of sensible qualities. Thus for instance surface colour densely occupies
a plane; it has texture and is diposed on planes of various intrinsic orientation;
volume colour is lacking in texture; film colour is disposed on a plane
that is always orthogonal to the line of sight of the viewer; and so on.
The French perceptual psychologist Jean Nogu&eacute;, generalizing Katz's
results, went so far as to classify the ways in which different sensous
qualities (colours, sounds, odours) fill space. If one interprets this
classification from the point of view of space itself, one can claim that
space is sensorily organized following different topologies. The typical
mode of diffusion of odours given off by a source, for example, organizes
the relevant space into non-oriented olfactory tracks; the recognition
of a sound source, on the other hand, organizes the space of the auditor
in oriented auditory paths; colours, in contrast, <i>enclose</i> or
<i>envelope</i>
space.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup></font>
<p><font face="Times">A part of this programme is developed also by Husserl's
doctoral student Wilhelm Schapp, who published in 1910 his <i>Contributions
to the Phenomenology of Perception</i>, an attempt to defend a much extended
variety of direct realism in the theory of perception. Visual perception,
Schapp argues, gives us immediate access not only to things and their colour
and form, but also to elasticity, solidity and other dispositional properties:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">We see whether a thing is smooth, as we
see whether the brass of the lamp is rough like our suit or whether it
is liquid like the water or the coffee or whether it is solid like the
cup; whether it is homogeneous like the brass, or grainy like the table;
whether it is sticky like the honey or runny like the ink. (1910, p. 19)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">Schapp especially contrasts cases in which some parts
only of an object are seen as moving with cases in which the whole of an
object moves:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">The case where the whole thing moves offers
us little insight into the `inner structure' of the thing. We then see
for example only the lightness or the heaviness of the thing. (1910, p.
21)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">When, on the contrary, some parts of the object move
whereas others do not, and this in a way which follows some lawlike pattern,
then we can see whether a body is elastic or whether it is composed of
viscous or solid matter (p. 22f). The configuration that is manifested
by a given qualitative filling of space both in dynamic cases, as in the
perception of elasticity, and also in static ones, as in the perception
of surface qualities such as lustre gives us access to certain structural
properties of the perceived thing. And this kind of knowledge which is
employed by the craftsman, for example Schapp contrasts explicitly with
that of the natural scientist (pp. 19, 21-26).</font>
<p><font face="Times">What is most interesting about the structural properties
picked out by Schapp is that they are properties relating to the <i>stuff</i>
of things: to their solidity, fluidity, and the like. Hedwig Conrad-Martius,
another early phenomenologist, offers complementary investigations of phenomena
linked to stuffs in her <i>Realontologie</i> of 1924. What differentiates
stuffs, according to Conrad-Martius, is their qualitative structure in
space:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">Material being<i> is</i> substantial fulness
in space. And it is precisely the manner in which this fulness is put together
in space which leads to the range of different modalities of material constitution
(&sect; 122).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">In chapter 3 ("Concrete Forms of Stuff") Conrad-Martius
then analyzes the ways in which sound and noise bear witness to the internal
organization of stuffs. She also analyzes the qualitative features of temperature
and light and offers a discussion of the different states of matter (&sect;&sect;
135-70), of naive atomistic explanations (&sect; 162), of such dispositional
properties of stuffs as elasticity, fragility and so on (&sect;&sect; 171-80),
and of aggregates (&sect; 176).</font>
<p><font face="Times">In this connection it is worth pointing out also
that as early as 1902 Pierre Duhem traced the history of the scientific
notion of `mixture' and provided an outline of its common-sense background
in certain elementary human operations. The concept of mixture, as he notes,
serves to link conceptually the two notions of aggregate or assembly on
the one hand and stuff in the strict sense on the other.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">4. Surfaces, Limits, Boundaries, Media</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">A systematic ontology of surfaces has been put forward
in Stroll's classic (1988), where he also investigates the role that is
played by surfaces from the point of view of epistemology. Stroll contrasts
two conceptions of surfaces: as <i>two-sided interfaces</i> (the surface
of an apple would in this sense involve both thing and medium); and as
<i>outermost
layers</i> (where only the apple itself is involved).</font>
<p><font face="Times">Descriptive details of the theory of surfaces are
to be found primarily in Gibson (1986), in the section entitled "Surface
and the ecological laws of surfaces". As Gibson writes:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">According to classical physics, the universe
consists of bodies in space. We are tempted to assume, therefore, that
we live in a physical world consisting of bodies in space and that what
we <i>perceive</i> consists of objects in space. But this is very dubious.
The terrestrial environment is better described in terms of a
<i>medium</i>,
<i>substances</i>,
and the <i>surfaces</i> that separate them. (1986, p. 16)</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">The medium, then, is separated from the substances of
the environment by surfaces, each surface being such as to have a characteristic
texture depending on the composition of the stuff of the relevant underlying
substance.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27) </a></sup>Gibson seeks accordingly
`a theory of surface layout, a sort of applied geometry that is appropriate
for the study of perception and behavior' and which would investigate concepts
such as: ground, open environment, enclosure, detached object, attached
object, hollow object, place, sheet, fissure, stick, fibre, dihedral, etc.
(1986, p. 33)</font>
<p><font face="Times">Husserl, on the other hand, describes media as the
normal environment for solid objects; they are
<i>amorphous</i>, in the
sense that they receive their form from the presence of material bodies
in them.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28) </a></sup>Media are furthermore the
vehicles of causality, and as a by-product of this they carry <i>information</i>
about causal sources of all kinds. They are usually transparent in the
sense that they do not themselves become objects of cognition in normal
cases, though they can, in special circumstances, be properly representable
in experience and they can be turned into such non-standard things as clouds
of smoke, and so on.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Fritz Heider's "Thing and Medium" (1926), an elaboration
of part of his doctoral dissertation written in Graz under Meinong's direction,
seeks an answer to a question central to causal theories of perception:
why, when we look at an object, do we perceive the object and not the illuminating
source, when the latter is after all causally responsible for the perceptual
experience?<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29) </a></sup>Heider then analyzes the
ambient conditions under which remote objects can be perceived. Not satisfied
with the simple statement of a causal relation between the distal and proximal
stimuli, he introduces concepts such as <i>relative dominance</i>, <i>order</i>
and <i>disorder</i> to account for the unaffectedness of the medium in
the course of the transfer of information. A solid thing, he holds, is
normally unsuited for the transmission of information which requires a
certain causal independence of the vehiculating parts involved. Heider's
work then finds echoes in Gibson's notion of perception as a picking up
of information in the ambient light (cf. esp. 1986, ch. 2).<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">5. Motivation, Requiredness, Value</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">The world of common sense in contrast to the naive-<i>physical
</i>worlds
described by Hayes,<i> et al</i>. is both salient and valuable: it is shot
through with complex gradients of <i>preferability</i>. The relevance of
this fact to a treatment of naive physics, now, turns on the fact that
one central aim of naive-physical investigations is to find a means of
simulating human action by means of intelligent artifacts. For it seems
clear that our human capacity successfully to find our way around the physical
world depends crucially upon the spontaneous ways in which we take such
value-differentials into account.</font>
<p><font face="Times">Our perceptual experiences are <i>caused </i>by objects
and they are grasped as such from the perspective of common sense. Experiences
are thereby bound together dynamically with the objects of this world through
relations of causality. Experiences and the objects of the common-sense
world are also bound together dynamically in a second sense, however, in
that the objects of this world, on being experienced, exert positive and
negative forces upon me belonging not to the sphere of causality but to
that of human salience and value. The common-sense world is in this sense
a meaningful dynamic whole that is shaped in manifold ways by forces of
attraction and repulsion.</font>
<p><font face="Times">One is reminded in this connection of the Gestalt-theoretical
notion of `requiredness' introduced by K&ouml;hler. Requiredness is a form
of reference, it is a relation <i>from </i>one thing <i>to</i> another.
Requiredness differs from other forms of reference, however, by its <i>demanding</i>
character. `It involves acceptance or rejection of the present status of
the context in question, often more particularly, acceptance or rejection
of some part by the remainder of the context.' (1938, p. 336)</font>
<p><font face="Times">When I apprehend things and persons and surrounding
circumstances I am determined by what Husserl calls `motivations'. One
object steers my regard onto itself through its special form. Another draws
attention to itself through its beautiful colour or texture. The noise
out there makes me close the window. The glass of beer over here makes
me reach out my arm to grasp it:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times">In short, in my theoretical, emotional,
and practical behaviour in my theoretical experience and thinking, in my
position-taking as to pleasure, enjoyment, hoping, wishing, desiring, wanting
<i>I
feel myself conditioned by the matter in question</i> (Husserl 1952, p.
140, cf. also p. 219).</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times">It is an invariant feature of our straightforward experience
that the objects motivate us in this sense. There are `effects' on the
subject emanating from the objects, effects of greater or lesser intensity.
And then, as K&ouml;hler points out: `The lower this intensity, the more
will a condition of merely factual [i.e. physical] relation, juxtaposition,
or sequence be realized.' (1938, p. 337)</font>
<p><font face="Times">We can consider as a thought experiment the idea
that we might present to ourselves the objects of the common-sense world
<i>merely</i>
perceptually. As subjects of this world, however, we are not merely perceiving
but also <i>acting</i> beings, and thus constantly subject to corresponding
motivations. Thus in normal conditions we effect spontaneous evaluations
of the objects by which we are confronted in a way which amounts to a sort
of <i>value-perception</i>: `the value-character itself is given in original
intuition.' (Husserl 1952, p. 186) We directly experience the world as
containing values, and thereby also we acquire mediate and immediate goals:
objects `afford' action, in Gibson's phrase. These affordances give rise
in turn to new motivational connections in light of the interrelations
between the various different goals and sub-goals in whose realization
we are at any given moment engaged. These values and goals can then be
seen as a new dimension of being within the common-sense world itself,
a dimension which, we should argue, is crucial to our capacity to find
our way around this world in a physical sense.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times">Conclusion</font></b>
<p><font face="Times">As most workers in the field of artificial intelligence
have recognized, naive physics is far from being a single, unified discipline.
Clusters and sub-clusters of concepts are investigated in a piecemeal way,
without much concern for their relation to the whole, in spite of the fact
that, as we stressed earlier, this conceptual network is marked by strong
holistic features which are reinforced by the pervasiveness of spatial
concepts and by the focus on those interactions which are relevant to the
concerns of our everyday human behaviour.</font>
<p><font face="Times">We have also seen that contemporary representations
of common-sense experience in the sphere of naive physics are over-narrow
to a degree which has had dramatic consequences for their reliability as
representations. We suggested earlier that this narrowness depends on too
quick a jump to implementationally attractive features of certain special
means of representing naive-physical knowledge, means derived, in effect
from the fundamentally atomistic (non-holistic) world of set theory. Against
this tendency we wish to stress once more the need for a wider, and deeper,
and more painstaking <i>phenomenological </i>investigation of the naive-physical
realm and of the associated value-laden dimensions of the world of common-sense
experience. The work of the Gestalists and of Gibson, taken together with
work in naive physics and in formal ontology in the tradition of the early
phenomenologists, has the chance of providing a unifying <i>theoretical</i>
framework for the development of a realistic account of the structures
here involved, in ways which can, we suggest, be of value also in the construction
of more adequate theories of the sort that are still needed by naive physicists
in the field of artificial intelligence.</font>

<br><font face="Times">Though hidden in a host of experimental reports,
a conception close to that of naive physics is present also in the work
of Jean Piaget, who investigated the `construction' of different strata
of reality in the child. (Of interest here are his investigations of causality,
reality, number, quantities, relations, time and movement.) See Piaget
1946, p. vii, for an explicit reference to Aristotelian conceptions, and

<p><a NAME="N_10_"></a><font face="Times">10. These same conceptions inspired

1990.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_16_"></a><font face="Times">16. Compare Sellars' discussion
of the `manifest image' of common sense: the scientific image, as Sellars
points out, `cannot replace the manifest image without rejecting its own
foundations' (1963, p. 21), Moreover, the ability of our rarefied concepts
of, say, elementary particles, to explain, and to induce understanding,
`derives from their origin in, and their gradual refinement from, the mundane
concepts of the manifest image.' (Garfield 1988, p. 116) The physicist
must of necessity appeal to the objects and processes of the common-sense
world also when testing his theoretical constructions against experience.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_17_"></a><font face="Times">17. Cf. the work of E. Rosch
and her associates on the role of prototypes in perception and learning,
and compare also the relevant work of Gestalt psychologists on the notion
of `<i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i>', work that is summarized by G. Kanizsa in his
paper in this volume. See also the discussion of typicality in A. Schutz
1959.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_18_"></a><font face="Times">18. Kotarbinski's `pansomatism'
is a monocategorial ontology which sees the world as made up entirely of
(inert, three-dimensional) things; Whitehead, in contrast, defends a monocategorial
ontology of processes. Quine, finally, defends a neutral monocategorialism
which allows of no distinction between processes and things. See Smith
1990.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a><font face="Times">19. See Thom 1988 and the brief
summary of Thom's views on event-types in Smith 1988, p. 34ff.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_20_"></a><font face="Times">20. See Cutting 1981, p. 75.
A structural typology along these lines was incidentally presented also
by Bertrand Russell in his <i>Human Knowledge</i>; see his 1948, ch. ix,
especially the discussion of what calls the `postulate of quasi-permanence'
and the `structural postulate'; cf. also the reference to Russell in Heider
1983, p. 39.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_21_"></a><font face="Times">21. As Husserl puts it:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><font face="Times"><i>if</i> the eye turns in a certain way,
<i>then</i>
so does the `image'; if it turns differently in some definite fashion,
then so does the image alter differently, in correspondence. We constantly
find here this two-fold articulation . . . Perception is without exception
a <i>unitary accomplishment</i> which arises essentially out of the playing
together of two <i>correlatively related functions.</i> (Husserl 1952,
p. 58. Cf. Gibson 1986, xiii)</font></blockquote>
<a NAME="N_22_"></a><font face="Times">22. See Husserl 1973, Beilage VII.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_23_"></a><font face="Times">23. See Casati and Varzi 1992.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_24_"></a><font face="Times">24. See Petitot and Smith 1990,
which develops ideas by Ren&eacute; Thom on the topology of the common-sense
world.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_25_"></a><font face="Times">25. Cf. G. Witschel 1961 for
a summary of Husserl's ideas in this direction, and also Katz 1911.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_26_"></a><font face="Times">26. See Nogu&eacute; 1936, p.
141 <i>et passim</i>. Interestingly parallel phenomena have been investigated
by Talmy, e.g. in his 1983.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_27_"></a><font face="Times">27. It is in his account of the
structures of surfaces, now, that Gibson, in his advocacy of ecology, comes
closest to Gestalt concepts. See e.g. 1986, p. 28, and compare also Kirschmann
1895 on sheen and van Fieandt 1949 on lustre.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_28_"></a><font face="Times">28. See Book II of his <i>Ideas</i>
(1952, Addendum to &sect; 16).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_29_"></a><font face="Times">29. This question is raised by
Meinong in his 1906, &sect; 25.</font>
