<b>Introduction</b>
<p>The current resurgence of interest in cognition and in the nature of
cognitive processing has brought with it also a renewed interest in the
early work of Husserl, one of the most sustained attempts to come to grips
with the problems of logic from a cognitive point of view. Logic, for Husserl,
is a <i>theory of science</i>; but it is a theory which takes seriously
the idea that scientific theories are constituted by the mental acts of
cognitive subjects. The present essay begins with an exposition of Husserl's
act-based conception of what a science is, and goes on to consider his
account of the role of linguistic meanings, of the ontology of scientific
objects, and of evidence and truth. The essay concentrates almost exclusively
on the <i>Logical Investigations</i> of 1900/01. This is not only because
this work, which is surely Husserl's single most important masterpiece,
has been overshadowed first of all by his <i>Ideas</i> I and then later
by the <i>Crisis</i>. It is also because the <i>Investigations</i> contain,
in a peculiarly clear and pregnant form, a whole panoply of ideas on logic
and cognitive theory which either simply disappeared in Husserl's own later
writings or became obfuscated by an admixture of that great mystery which
is 'transcendental phenomenology'.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 1. Logic as Theory of Science</b>
<p>One might, as a first approximation, regard a scientific theory as a
multiplicity of acts of knowing, of verifyings and falsifyings, validatings
and calculatings, on the part of successive generations of cognitive subjects.
Of course not every collection of acts of knowing constitutes a science.
Such acts must manifest, for example, a certain intrinsic organisation,
they must be set apart in determinate ways from cognitive acts of other
sorts and also from their objects, and they must be capable of being communicated
from one group of scientists to another. Husserl's logic is, then, a theory
which seeks to determine the conditions which must be satisfied by a collection
of acts if it is to count as a science. It is in this sense that logic
is a `theory of science' and of all that is necessarily connected therewith.
<p>Theory realises itself in certain mental acts, but it is clear that
the more or less randomly delineated collections of knowings and judgings
concretely performed by cognitive subjects on given occasions will have
properties that are of little relevance to logic. Husserl however saw that
we can put ourselves in a position where we are able to understand the
intrinsic organisation of collections of scientific acts if we consider
such collections from a certain idealising standpoint.
<p>In fact, there are three distinct sorts of idealisation which are involved
in the properly logical reflection on scientific acts:
<p>I. The members of a collection of acts must be idealised, first of all,
in that they are considered not as individual events or processes of judging,
inferring, verifying, but as <i>universals</i>, as <i>species</i> or <i>kinds</i>
of such events, capable of being instantiated in principle at any time
or place: `the theoretical content of a science is nothing other than the
meaning-content of its theoretical statements independent of all contingency
of judgers and occasions of judgment' (II A92/332).<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
<p>II. These species or kinds must themselves be idealised by being considered
not as classes or extensions, but rather as 'ideal singulars'. We are interested
in species of acts not as collections of individual instances, but as <i>proxies</i>
or <i>representatives</i> of such instances in the sphere of idealities,
related together in representative structures of certain sorts.
<p>III. The total collection of ideal singulars corresponding to each given
empirical realm of individual instances must then in turn be idealised
by being seen as enjoying a certain sort of <i>ideal completeness</i>:
thus a scientific theory in the strict sense that is relevant to logic
must enjoy the property of deductive closure.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup>
<p>We shall have to deal, then, with certain ideal structures of species
of simple and complex cognitive acts of various sorts. The most important
nodes in such ideal structures are occupied by species of acts of judgment,
and these can be divided in turn into two sorts, corresponding to the two
different roles which individual judging acts may play on the level of
underlying instances. On the one hand are the <i>primitive</i> judgment-species
whose truth is self-evident (or is taken as such), for example <i>red is
a colour</i>. On the other hand are the judgment-species which 'are grasped
by us as true only when they are methodically validated' (I A16/63). It
is at this point that we reach the heart of logic as Husserl conceives
it. Some judgments are and must be <i>derived by laws from others</i>.
We are thereby enabled to move beyond what is trivially or immediately
evident to that which is enlightening, which brings clarification. (I A234/229)
It is this fact which 'not only makes the sciences possible and necessary,
but with these also a <i>theory of science</i>, a <i>logic</i>.' (I A16/63).
<p>It is a matter of some note that such a science of science exists at
all, that it is possible to deal within a single theory with that which
all sciences have in common in their modes of validation, irrespective
of the specific material of their constituent acts and objects. For it
is not evident that there should be, as Husserl puts it, necessary and
universal laws relating to truth as such, to deduction as such, and to
theory as such, laws founded "purely on the concept of truth, of proposition,
of object, of property, of relation, etc., i.e., in the concepts which
as a matter of essence make up the concept of theoretical unity.' (I A111/136)
<br>On immersing ourselves in the practice of theory, however, we very
soon discover that the modes of interconnection which bind together the
judging acts which ideally constitute a scientific theory do indeed belong
to a fixed and intelligible repertoire, being distinguished by the fact
that:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1</b>. they have 'the character of fixed structures in relation to
their content. In order to reach a given piece of knowledge (e.g. Pythagoras'
theorem), we cannot choose our starting points at random among the knowledge
immediately given to us, nor can we thereafter add or subtract any thought-items
at will' (I A17/64),
<p><b>2</b>. they are not arbitrary: 'A blind caprice has not bundled together
any old heap of truths <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>P</i><sub>2</sub>,...<i>S</i>,
and then so instituted the human mind that it must inevitably (or in "normal"
circumstances) connect the knowledge of <i>S</i> to the knowledge of <i>P</i><sub>1</sub>,
<i>P</i><sub>2</sub>,...
In no single case is this so. Connections of validation are not governed
by caprice or contingency, but by reason and order, and that means: regulative
laws' (I A18/64),
<p><b>3</b>. they are formal, i.e. they are not bound up with particular
territories of knowledge: all types of logical sequences 'may be so generalised,
so purely conceived, as to be free of all essential relation to some concretely
limited field of knowledge.' (I A19/65)
<p>This means that, the form of a given validation having once been established,
it is possible for us to justify all other validations of this same form
- all validations that conform to a given law - <i>in one go</i>, just
as in mathematics it is possible for us simultaneously to determine the
properties of a whole family of structures conforming to any given set
of axioms.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 2. Meanings as Species</b>
<p>There is no science without language. This is not merely because scientific
judgments must, as a matter of anthropological fact, be communicable, but
also because scientific judgments are typically of such an order of complexity
that they could not arise without verbal expression. It is therefore incumbent
upon us to examine the ways in which the grammatical clothing of a scientific
theory relates to the other parts and moments of that complex of structures
which is the subject-matter of logic.
<p>Husserl's conception of language, too, is cognitively based. Linguistic
expressions are seen as having meaning only to the extent that they are
<i>given</i>
meaning through cognitive acts of certain determinate sorts. Those acts
which, in becoming bound up with uses of language, may carry out this meaning-giving
function are in every case acts in which objects are given to the language-using
subject either in perception or in thought: 'To use an expression significantly,
and to refer expressively to an object', Husserl tells us, 'are one and
the same.' (II A54/293) An act of meaning is, we might therefore say, 'the
determinate manner in which we refer to our object of the moment' (II A49/289).<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup>
<p>Husserl's theory of linguistic meaning, like his theory of logic, is
therefore non-Platonistic in the sense that it is free of any conception
of meanings as ideal or abstract objects hanging in the void in a way which
would leave them cut apart from concrete acts of language use. Husserl
does however accept that it is inadequate to conceive the meanings bestowed
on given expressions on given occasions as being exhausted in the particular
acts involved. For meanings can be communicated. They can be realised by
different subjects at different places and times. Hence they cannot be
accounted for theoretically in merely psychological terms, as real parts
or moments of concrete experiences. What, then, are meanings? Husserl's
solution to this problem is both elegant and bold: it is to develop a conception
of the meanings of linguistic expressions simply as the <i>species</i>
of the associated meaning acts.
<p>To see what this means we must note first of all that meaning acts are
divided by Husserl into two kinds: those associated with <i>uses of names</i>,
which are acts of presentation,<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> and those
associated with <i>uses of sentences</i>, which are acts of judgment. The
former are directed towards <i>objects</i>, the latter towards<i> states
of affairs</i>.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> A meaning act of the
first kind may occur either in isolation or (undergoing a certain sort
of transformation) in the context of a meaning act of the second kind:
'Each meaning is on this doctrine either a nominal meaning or a propositional
meaning, or, still more precisely, either the meaning of a complete sentence
or a possible part of such a meaning.' (II A482/676) The meanings of names,
now, which Husserl calls concepts, are just <i>species of presentations</i>;
the meanings of sentences, which Husserl calls propositions, are just <i>species
of acts of judgment</i>. And the relation between meaning and associated
act of meaning is in every case the relation of species to instance, exactly
as between, say, the species <i>red</i> and some red object.
<p>More precisely, we should say that, just as it is only a certain part
of the red object - its individual accident of redness - which instances
the species <i>red</i>, so it is only a certain part or moment of the meaning
act which instances any given meaning-species, namely that part or moment
which is responsible for the act's intentionality, for its being directed
to an object in just this way.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup> The meaning
is just this moment of directedness considered <i>in specie</i>:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>There correspond to meanings, as to all ideal unities, real
possibilities and perhaps actualities; to meanings <i>in specie </i>there
correspond acts of meaning, and the former are nothing other than the ideally
apprehended act-moments of the latter. (II A322/533)<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></blockquote>
The identity of meaning from act to act and from subject to subject is
then simply the <i>identity of the species</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>In the concrete act of meaning a certain moment corresponds
to the meaning and makes up the essential character of this act, i.e. necessarily
belongs to each concrete act in which this same meaning is "realised".
(II A302/B312/506)</blockquote>
We can talk of 'the same' meaning from speaker to speaker and from occasion
to occasion simply in virtue of the fact that numerically different individual
moments of meaning on the side of the relevant acts serve to instantiate
identical species. Indeed to assert that given individual objects or events
instantiate one and the same species is simply to assert that the objects
or events in question manifest among themselves a certain qualitative identity
of parts or moments - that they are, <i>in this or that respect</i>, identical,
are one and the same.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a> </sup>One might indeed,
though the detailed justification of this proposal would lead us too far
from our main concerns, see Husserl's talk of species here as consisting
effectively in a shorthand for more common or garden talk about certain
exact similarities among individual instances.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
<p>It is important to stress that meanings so conceived are not the <i>objects</i>
of normal acts of language use.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup> We
do not mean the meaning of an expression by having this meaning as the
object of any associated act, but by being directed to an appropriate ordinary
object or state of affairs in such a way that, willy nilly, the meaning
is instantiated. Meanings can however become our objects in special types
of reflective act, and it is acts of this sort which make up (<i>inter
alia</i>) the science of logic. Logic arises when we treat those species
which are meanings as special sorts of <i>proxy objects</i> (as 'ideal
singulars'), and investigate the properties of these objects in much the
same way that the mathematician investigates the properties of numbers
or geometrical figures.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup>
<p>Thus consider for example the number five. This is not my own or anyone
else's number five: 'it is the ideal species of a form which has its concrete
individual instances on the side of what becomes objective in certain acts
of counting' (I B171/180). Two different sorts of objects are then involved:
empirical objects which get counted, thereby yielding empirical groupings
(as e.g. when we talk of there being 'a number of objects on the table');
and ideal objects, which are what result when such empirical groupings
are treated <i>in specie</i>, disembarrassed of all contingent association
with particular empirical material and particular context. And now the
same applies to all the concepts of logic: just as terms like 'line', 'triangle',
'hemisphere' are equivocal, signifying both classes of factually existing
instantiations and ideal singulars in the geometrical sphere, so terms
like 'concept', 'proposition', 'inference', 'proof', etc., are equivocal:
they signify both classes of mental acts belonging to the subject-matter
of psychology and ideal singulars in the sphere of meanings.
<p>Of course when, in our logical investigations, we speak about meanings
<i>in
specie</i>, then the meaning of what we say is itself a species. 'But it
is not so, that the meaning in which a species is thought, and its object,
the species itself, are one and the same.' The species we think about is
a general object, but 'the generality <i>that</i> we think of does not
resolve itself into the generality of the meanings <i>in which</i> we think
of it.' (II A103/331) Those general objects which are meanings (concepts,
propositions, higher-order meaning-structures including entire theories)
differ in this respect not at all from general objects of other sorts,
be they numbers, geometrical structures, or species of qualities given
in sensation.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 3. Species Talk and Implicational Universals</b>
<p>We can now begin to see how the necessity of logic can enter into the
flux of real mental acts. The latter, in so far as they carry identical
meanings, instantiate species which satisfy necessary laws, laws which
are no different, in principle, from the laws of a science such as geometry.
The laws associated with given species are such that they continue to obtain
even where, as a matter of empirical fact, the species in question are
not instantiated. This will enable us to do justice to the status of a
science as an<i> ideally complete structure</i> of meanings that is always
only partially instantiated by given empirically existing collections of
meaning acts.
<p>Species laws are in fact always in a certain sense hypothetical, taking
forms such as
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>if instances of species <i>S</i> exist, then as a matter of
necessity there exist also instances of the species <i>S</i>', <i>S</i>",
etc.,</blockquote>

<blockquote>if instances of species <i>S</i>, <i>S</i>', etc., exist in
association with each other, then it is possible that there exist also
associated instances of species <i>T</i>, <i>T </i>', etc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>if instances of species <i>S</i>, <i>S</i>', etc., exist in
association with each other, then it is necessarily excluded that they
should be associated also with instances of the species <i>U</i>, <i>U</i>',
etc.</blockquote>
Consider, for example, the geometrical law to the effect that the angle
obtained by joining the two end-points of the diameter of a circle to some
other point on the circumference is always a right angle. Here we have
a law relating together a number of structures and part-structures (lines,
angles, points, circles) purely <i>in specie</i>, and clearly there is
a sense in which this law has validity even if, as a matter of empirical
fact, the structures in question are not instantiated. For even then it
remains the case that <i>if</i> a structure of the given sort <i>were</i>
realised, then these and those other structures would be realised also.
Or consider the assertion that an action of promising gives rise as a matter
of necessity to a mutually correlated claim and obligation. Here, too,
we have a law, pertaining to certain structures in the quasi-legal sphere,
which retains its validity even if, as a matter of empirical fact, actions
of the relevant sort should not occur.
<p>'Implicational universals' of the given sort have been investigated
in detail by linguists and cognitive scientists in recent years, and it
seems that it is precisely universals of this kind that Husserl has in
mind when he talks about species and about 'spheres of necessary law'.
As he himself writes:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>If all gravitating masses were destroyed, the law of gravitation
would not thereby be suspended: it would merely remain without the possibility
of factual application. For it tells us nothing regarding the existence
of gravitating masses, but only about that which pertains to gravitating
masses as such. (I A149f./164)</blockquote>
Similarly, even in a world without intelligent beings it would remain <i>possible</i>
that meanings of certain sorts should be instantiated, and it would remain
the case that, if instantiated, such meanings would be subject to certain
necessary laws. Thus again, it is not as if meanings would 'hang somewhere
in the void'; meanings are rather a matter of possibilities of being realised
in actual meaning acts. And <i>what</i> I mean by a given expression 'is
the same thing, whether I think and exist or not, and whether or not there
are any thinking persons and acts.' (II A100/329)
<p>The relations among meanings with which logic is concerned can thus
be considered apart from all relation to any thinking subject. The laws
expressing these relations talk not of knowing, judging, inferring, but
rather of concept, proposition, inference. These laws may however 'undergo
evident transformations through which they acquire an express relation
to knowledge and to the knowing subject, and now themselves pronounce on
real possibilities of knowing.' (I A239/233) It is in virtue of the possibility
of transformations of this sort that the propositions of logic may once
again have application to real, cognitive achievements of thinking subjects.
<p>One particularly interesting and important set of such evident transformations
consists of those derived laws which enable us to go from <i>truth</i>,
an objective matter, to <i>evidence</i>, a character of mental. 'Each truth
represents an ideal unity in relation to what is possibly an infinite and
unlimited manifold of correct statements of the same form and matter.'
(I A187/192) Even if there are no intelligent beings and no correct statements
then this ideal unity and its associated possibilities of instantiation
remain, though without actually being realised. <i>It is the truth that
p</i> and <i>There could have been thinking beings having evidence into
judgments to the effect that p</i> are, Husserl tells us, equivalent. This
should not, however, be taken to imply that Husserl identifies the notions
of truth and evidence (and much less does he confuse them):
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>In itself the proposition <i>A is true</i> plainly does not
state the same thing as its equivalent <i>It is possible for someone to
judge [evidently] that A is</i>. The former says nothing about anyone's
judgment... Things stand here just as with the propositions of pure mathematics.
The assertion that a + b = b + a states that the numerical value of the
sum of two numbers is independent of their position in the combination,
but it says nothing about anyone's counting or summing. The latter first
enters in through an evident, and equivalent transformation. <i>In concreto</i>
there is after all (and this <i>a priori</i>) no number without counting,
no sum without summing. (I A184f./190)</blockquote>
The logic of the ideal structures of inference and validation can have
applicability to proofs and inferences empirically performed, since once
we have established by logical means the laws stating how 'the being-true
of propositions of certain forms determines that of propositions of correlated
forms', then we can see that these laws 'admit of equivalent transformations
in which the possible emergence of evidence is set into relation with the
propositional forms of judgments' (I A184/190).
<p>Validations and proofs relating propositional meanings as ideal singulares
are therefore also structures guaranteeing the inheritability of evidence
in the sphere of concrete judging acts. This they achieve by making it
possible for us to grasp the fact that a given sequence of propositions,
purely in virtue of its form, instantiates a certain law. For logical reflection
is able to
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>set forth abstractively the relevant underlying law itself
and to bring the multiplicity of laws to be gained by this means, which
are at first merely single cases of laws, back to the primitive basic laws;
it thereby creates a scientific system which, in ordered sequence and purely
deductively, permits the derivation of all possible purely logical laws,
all possible "forms" of inferences, proofs, etc. (I A163/174)</blockquote>

<p><b>&sect; 4. The Theory of Meaning Categories</b>
<p>Science as cognitive activity is constituted out of collections of acts
of judging, validating, verifying. Science as theory is constituted out
of the homogeneous fabric of meanings taken <i>in specie</i>. There are
different levels of complexity, different varieties of combination of the
elements making up this fabric, and only some possible combinations will
yield complex meanings possessing that sort of unity which is required
if the meanings in question are to be qualified to form part of the subject-matter
of logic. It was in relation to this problem that Husserl, in his 4th Investigation,
put forward those ideas on meaning categories which were to prove so influential
through the work of Leniewski and Ajdukiewicz and in subsequent experiments
in the field of 'categorial grammar'.
<p>The theory of meaning categories as Husserl conceives it is part and
parcel of his theory of meanings as species. For Husserl's use of the term
'species' (and of the associated terminology of 'genera', 'instantiation',
'lowest difference', etc.) is no mere historical accident. It was designed
to draw attention to the fact - familiar to Aristotle and Porphyry, as
also to Brentano and W. E. Johnson - that <i>species form trees</i>: if
<i>A</i>
is similar to <i>B</i> in some given respect, i.e. if both instantiate
some species <i>S</i>, then <i>A</i> is similar to <i>B</i> in all superordinate
respects, i.e. both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> instantiate all <i>S</i>-including
species higher up the relevant tree.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>
Each tree of species is crowned by a certain highest species or 'category'
including all the species lower down the tree. Such highest species are
'primitive' or 'indefinable' in the strict Aristotelian sense that they
do not arise through composition of any specific differences. Husserl's
<i>meaning
categories</i>, now, are just the highest species in the realm of meanings,
and therefore they, too, are 'primitive' in this sense.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
<p>Higher and lower level meaning species, as we have already had occasion
to note, can be taken either as many or as one, as species or as ideal
singulars standing proxy for the relevant instantiating acts. But now each
meaning species <i>S</i>, when taken as an ideal singular, bears to its
respective category a similar relation to that which the relevant instances
of <i>S</i> bear to <i>S</i> itself, taken as species.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>
To investigate the connections and combinations of highest species is therefore
also to investigate the range of possible connections and combinations
of the relevant lower level meaning species themselves, and therefore also
of the underlying acts which correspond thereto.
<p>Categorial grammar is thus for Husserl not a matter of building up a
grammatical theory on the basis of a more or less arbitrary selection of
convenient and conventional combinatoric units. It is a descriptive theory,
a science, taking as its subject-matter the ideal structures obtaining
in the meaning sphere itself, and therefore also in the sphere of object-giving
acts. The laws of this science, laws governing the objective and ideal
possibilities and impossibilities of combination among meanings, are laws
relating precisely to such highest species. They set forth 'the <i>a priori</i>
patterns in which meanings belonging to the different meaning categories
can unite together to form a single meaning' (II A287/493), as opposed
to those merely possible combinations - 'and swam if never apple knock'
- which yield only meaning heaps. It is not any merely empirical incapacity
on our part which puts it beyond us to realise such a heap as a unity:
'the impossibility is rather objective, ideal, rooted in the pure essence
of the meaning realm'. (II A308/511)
<p>Husserl's science of meaning categories is the science which deals with
combination-possibilities among meanings purely from the point of view
of their intrinsic well-formedness and abstracting from any possible cognitive
employment and from all questions relating to truth and reference. There
is however a further level of possibility and impossibility among meanings
which we encounter when we consider meanings in respect of their having
or not having objects or in respect of their corresponding or not corresponding
to states of affairs. The first level is the level of grammar, a matter
of the presence or absence of sense or meaning as such in given meaning-combinations
(and of correspondingly unified complexes of instantiating acts). The second
level is the level of logic proper, a matter of the presence or absence
of objectual correlates for meanings already established as unified. To
the impossibilities on the first level belong cases such as 'a round or',
'a man and is'. To the impossibilities on the second level belong cases
such as 'a round square' or 'this colour is a judgment'.
<p>Impossibilities of the first sort are such that their constituent part-meanings
cannot even come together to form a unity on the level of meaning alone.
We cannot fit together corresponding presentations in such a way as to
yield a unified directedness to any sort of object, whether existent or
non-existent, possible or impossible. At most we can patch together 'an
indirect presentation aiming at the synthesis of such part- meanings in
a single meaning, and at the same time have insight into the fact that
such a presentation can never correspond to an object' (II A312f./517).
Impossibilities of the second sort, in contrast, clearly do in fact yield
unified meanings, reflecting a corresponding unity on the level of objectifying
acts, a unity of complexity within a single act, of 'part-presentations
and dependent presentation-forms within an independently closed presentation-unity'
(II A295/500f.). But it is no less evident that there could be no object
which would correspond thereto: 'An object (e.g. a thing or state of affairs)
in which there is unified all that the unified meaning on the strength
of its "incompatible" meanings presents as unitarily pertaining to it does
not and cannot exist' (II A312f./517).
<p>There are, then, simple meanings and complex meanings, and both can
be combined together in different ways, governed by necessary laws into
which we can have insight of the kind that is enjoyed e.g. by the theorems
of geometry. At the one extreme we have a unity of several meanings within
a single complex whole. At the opposite extreme we have a mere meaning
heap. Between these two extremes we have various ways in which the combination
of meanings can be merely partial, ways in which instantiating acts are
capable of being combined together but in such a way that they do not and
cannot constitute a complete and self- contained unity of judgment or presentation:
'John is nearly', 'If John were', '+ 2 ='. Such combinations require, as
a matter of categorial law, a larger surrounding context within which they
can be brought to a completion of an appropriate sort. Simple meanings,
too, above all the various connective forms: 'and', 'if', 'but', etc.,
may be partial in this sense, and there are also partial meanings which
include as parts whole meanings which are in themselves capable of making
up 'the full, entire meaning of a concrete meaning act' (II A303/506):
'John is swimming but', 'Before she opened the door'. In this way we obtain
an opposition between <i>dependent meanings</i>, both simple and complex,
which stand in need of a larger meaning context, and <i>independent meanings</i>,
where the process of completion has been successfully brought to an end.
Dependent and independent meanings, like all combinations of species are
subject to necessary laws. The opposition between the two sorts of meanings
'has its objective ground in law in the nature of the [meanings] in question.'
(II A302/506).
<p>Expressions, correspondingly, are divided into <i>syncategorematic</i>
and <i>categorematic</i>. The former are not meaningless. They carry a
determinate though characteristically modified moment of meaning even when
they occur in isolation. And when they occur normally, i.e. in the context
of an independently complete expression, they have as their meaning a certain
dependent part or moment of the total thought.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 5. Formal Ontology</b>
<p>Logic is not, however, concerned only with meanings and with associated
instantiating acts. For even a deductively closed collection of meanings
will constitute a science only where we have an appropriate unity and organisation
also on the side of the <i>objects</i> to which the relevant acts refer.
The unity of scientific theory can in fact be understood to mean either
(1) an <i>interconnection of truths</i> (or of propositional meanings in
general), or (2) an <i>interconnection of the things</i> to which our cognitive
acts are directed.
<p>Since meanings are just ways of being directed towards objects, it follows
that (1) and (2) 'are given together <i>a priori</i> and are mutually inseparable'
(I A228f./225). And logic, accordingly, relates not only to meaning categories
such as <i>truth</i> and <i>proposition</i>, <i>subject</i> and <i>predicate</i>,
but also to object categories such as <i>object</i> and <i>property</i>,
<i>relation</i>
and <i>relatum</i>, <i>manifold</i>, <i>part</i>, <i>whole</i>,
<i>state
of affairs</i>, and so on.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup> Logic seeks
therefore to delimit the concepts which belong to the idea of a unity of
theory in relation to both meanings and objects, and the truths of logic
are all the necessary truths relating to those categories of constituents,
on the side of both meanings and objects, from out of which science as
such is necessarily constituted.
<p>Husserl's conception of the science of logic as relating also to formal-ontological
categories such as <i>object</i>, <i>state of affairs</i>, <i>unity</i>,
<i>plurality</i>,
and so on, is not an arbitrary one. These concepts are, like the concepts
of formal logic, able to form complex structures in non-arbitrary, law-governed
ways, and they, too, are independent of the peculiarity of any material
of knowledge. This means that in formal ontology, as in formal logic, we
are able to grasp the properties of given structures in such a way as to
establish<i> in one go</i> the properties of all formally similar structures.
<p>As Husserl himself points out, certain branches of mathematics are partial
realisations of the idea of a formal ontology. The mathematical theory
of manifolds as this was set forth by Riemann and developed by Grassmann,
Hamilton, Lie and Cantor, was to be a science of the essential types of
possible object-domains of scientific theories, so that all actual object-
domains would be specialisations or singularisations of certain manifold-forms.
And then: 'If the relevant formal theory has actually been worked out in
the theory of manifolds, then all deductive theoretical work in the building
up of all actual theories of the same form has been done.' (I A249f./242)
That is to say, once we have worked out the laws governing mathematical
manifolds of a certain sort, our results can be applied - by a process
of 'specialisation' - to every individual manifold sharing this same form.
Husserl's discovery of this essential community of logic and ontology is
of the utmost importance for his philosophy of mathematics. It can be shown
to imply a non- trivial account of the applicability of mathematical theories
- of a sort that is missing, for example, from a philosophy of mathematics
of the kind defended by Frege - as a matter of the direct specialisation
of the relevant formal object-structures to particular material realisations
in given spheres.
<p>How, then, are we more precisely to understand Husserl's account of
the relation between theory as structure of meanings and theory as structure
of objects and objectual relations? A theory as a structure of meanings
is a certain deductively closed combination of propositions (and higher
order meaning structures) which are themselves determinate sorts of combinations
of concepts and combination-forms. Just as the propositions are species
of judgments, so the concepts which are their parts are species of linguistically
expressible presentations. The concepts in question are in each case of
determinate material: they are concepts of a dog, of an electron, of a
colour (or of this dog, of dogs in general, of electrons in general) and
so on. But we can move from this level of material concepts to the purely
formal level of: <i>a something</i>, <i>this something</i>, <i>something
in general</i> and so on, by allowing materially determinate concepts to
become mere place-holders for any concepts whatsoever - a process of 'formalisation'.
The idea of a theory-form now arises when we regard all materially determinate
concepts in a given body of theory as having been replaced in this fashion
by mere variables, by materially empty concepts, so that only the formal
structure of the theory is retained.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>
<p>What, now, is the objectual correlate of such a theory-form? It is the
structure shared in common by all possible regions of knowledge to which
a theory of this form can relate, a structure determined solely as one
'whose objects are such as to permit of these and these connections which
fall under these and these basic laws of this or that determinate form.'
(I A248/241) Here again, therefore, it is form alone that serves as determining
feature. The objects in the given structure are quite indeterminate as
regards their matter: they constitute, as it were, mere shells or frames
into which various matters can, in principle, be fitted. And the structure
as a whole is determined merely by the fact that its objects (nodes) stand
in certain formally determined relations and permit of certain formal operations,
for example the operation that is represented by '+', defined as commutative,
associative, etc.
<p>For a collection of scientific statements to constitute a theory, then,
there must be on this purely formal level an 'ideal-lawful adequacy of
its unity as unity of meaning to the objective correlate meant by it' (II
A92/323). The objects <i>meant</i> by the constituent propositions of the
theory (and therefore also by corresponding judging acts) must <i>hang
together</i> in a precisely appropriate way, must constitute the formal
unity of a certain determinate formal manifold.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 6. The Formal Ontology of Dependence</b>
<p>Husserl himself, particularly in his manuscripts on the foundations
of arithmetic and analysis written at a time when he was collaborating
with Cantor in Halle, was deeply involved with early developments in the
theory of manifolds and with the offshoots of this theory in geometry and
topology.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup> His most original contribution
to formal ontology was however his work on theory of parts and moments,
of dependence and independence, set forth in detail in the 3rd Logical
Investigation. We have already seen the notions of dependence and independence
at work in the theory of meaning combinations above, and Husserl's terminology
of 'moment' has accompanied us throughout the present essay. These notions
were employed also by Brentano and Stumpf in their work on the ontology
of mental acts, and Stumpf, in particular, had used a fledgeling theory
of dependence as early as 1873 in his investigations of the structures
of acts of spatial perception.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup> It was
however Husserl who was the first to recognise that the given notions are
capable of being applied, in principle, to all varieties of objects, that
the proper place for the distinction between dependence and independence
is in a 'pure (<i>a priori</i>) theory of objects as such' (II A222/435),
'in the framework of <i>a priori</i> formal ontology.' (II B219/428f.).
<p>The notion of dependence can be set forth, very roughly, in terms of
the definition:
<p><i>A</i> is dependent on <i>B</i> =: <i>A</i> is as a matter of necessity
such that it cannot exist unless <i>B</i> exists.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup>
<p>It is not however individuals as such that are dependent or independent,
but individuals <i>qua</i> instances of certain species. The notions of
dependence and independence can therefore be carried over to the species
themselves 'which can, in a corresponding and somewhat altered sense, be
spoken of as "independent" and "dependent".' (A237/448)
<p>On the basis of this simple notion of dependence or foundation a whole
family of other, associated notions can be defined. Thus we can distinguish
between one-sided and reciprocal dependence, between mediate and immediate
dependence, and between the case where an individual is linked by dependence
to one and to a multiplicity of founding objects in a range of different
ways. The resulting theory has a number of interesting mathematical properties.
As has been shown in recent unpublished work by Kit Fine, it can be compared
with an extension of standard whole-part theory obtained by adding notions
of connectedness derived from topology. The formal ideas on which it rests
have been applied with some success not only in psychology but also in
linguistics.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup> Perhaps the most interesting
employment of the theory however - if only in view of the almost total
neglect of this fact by Husserl's myriad modern commentators<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
- was by Husserl himself within the discipline of phenomenology. For the
detailed descriptions of the structures of acts which are provided by Husserl,
as indeed the larger metaphysical claims that he makes on behalf of his
new discipline, are remarkably often phrased in the terminology of the
theory of dependence or foundation.
<p>From our present point of view it is important to stress that the theory
of dependence, because it relates always to species, or to individuals
<i>qua</i>
instances of species, is a matter of ideal and therefore necessary laws:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>It is not a peculiarity of certain sorts of parts that they
should only be parts in general, while it would remain quite indifferent
what conglomerates with them, and into what sorts of contexts they are
fitted. Rather there obtain firmly determined relations of necessity, <i>contentually</i>
determinate laws which vary with the species of dependent contents and
accordingly prescribe one sort of completion to one of them another sort
of completion to another. (II A244f./454)<sup>25</sup></blockquote>
<b>&sect; 7. Unity and Compatibility</b>
<p>The theory of dependence is of importance for logic as theory of science
first of all because it is in the terms of this theory that the idea of
unity is to be clarified.<sup>26</sup> Every instance of unity, Husserl
tells us, is based on a necessary law asserting, on the level of species,
certain relations of foundation and compatibility between the unified parts.
Compatibility, too, pertains not to individuals but always to instances
of species. Thus the fact that individual instances of redness and roundness
may be unified together in a single whole implies that there is a complex
species, a form of combination, which can be seen to be capable of being
re-instantiated also in other wholes. This complex species is the foundation
of the compatibility, which obtains whether empirical union ever occurs
or not; or rather, to say that compatibility obtains, is just to say that
the corresponding complex species exists.<sup>27</sup>
<p>The theory of meaning categories may now be conceived as the science
of those complex species which are forms of combination among meanings.
To say that a given complex meaning exists, i.e. that there is a certain
determinate possibility of instantiation in individual meaning acts, is
to say that there is a certain corresponding compatibility among the given
acts and among their various parts and moments.<sup>28</sup>
<p>Incompatibility or mutual exclusion, too, is in each case a certain
complex species which puts determinate lower order species into a certain
determinate relation within certain determinate contexts. Thus for example:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Several moments of colour of varying specific difference are
incompatible as regards overlays of one and the same bodily extension,
while they are very well compatible in the manner of standing side by side
within a uniform extension. And this holds generally. A content of the
species <i>q</i> is never <i>simply</i> incompatible with a content of
the species <i>P</i>: talk of their incompatibility always relates rather
to a definite species of combination of contents, W(<i>A</i>,<i>B</i>...<i>P</i>),
which includes <i>P</i> and <i>should</i> now take up into itself <i>q</i>
as well. (II A580/753)</blockquote>

<p><b>&sect; 8. Quality, Matter and Representative Content</b>
<p>The theory of dependence is important to logic not merely in providing
an account of notions such as unity and (in)compatibility, however, but
also because it can be used as the basis of an account of the cognitively
and logically relevant dimensions of variation in those mental acts of
whose ideal structures logic ultimately treats. Husserl distinguishes between
three such dimensions of variation: the <i>quality</i> of the act, its
<i>matter</i>,
and its <i>representative content</i>.
<p>The quality of an act is that moment of the act which stamps it 'as
merely presentative, as judgmental, as emotional, as desiderative, and
so on' (II B411/586). The matter is 'that which stamps it as presenting
<i>this</i>,
as judging <i>that</i>, etc.', in the sense that those acts have the same
matter whose intended object (and the way that it is intended) is the same.
The matter is 'that in an act which first gives it directedness to an object,
and directedness so wholly definite that it not merely fixes the object
meant, but also the way in which it is meant.' (II A390/589)
<p>Likeness of matter with differing act-quality 'has its visible grammatical
expression':
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>A man who imagines to himself that <i>there are intelligent
beings on Mars</i>, presents the same as he who asserts <i>there are intelligent
beings on Mars</i>, and the same as the man who asks <i>Are there intelligent
beings on Mars?</i> or the man who wishes<i> If only there were intelligent
beings on Mars!</i> etc. (II A387/586f.)</blockquote>

<p><br>And indeed the dimensions of variation in the grammatical expression
of the act can point the way for our analysis of variation in the act itself.<sup>29</sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Act-quality and act-matter are two mutually dependent moments
of the act: it is a matter of necessity that each cannot exist without
the other. Just as the act-matter is unthinkable without some quality,
so each act-quality is unthinkable 'as cut free from all matter'. Or should
we perhaps hold as possible an experience which would be judgment-quality
but not judgment of a determinate matter? The judgment would thereby after
all lose the character of an intentional experience, which has been evidently
ascribed as essential to it. (II A391/589)</blockquote>

<p><br>Quality and matter are however also associated with a third dimension
of variation, the dimension of what Husserl calls<i> representative content</i>.
This we can think of as consisting in our act's being <i>more or less intuitively
filled</i>, in its being <i>more or less in touch with the things themselves</i>
towards which our acts are directed: it is a matter of that in the act
which goes proxy for the object. Alternatively (and from the opposite perspective)
we can regard it as consisting in our act's being <i>more or less linguistically
articulated</i>, in its being <i>more or less a matter of mere signs</i>.
<p>Acts which are least in touch with the things themselves and which are
entirely a matter of linguistic or signitive directedness have as their
content just that which is contributed by the signs themselves, the various
<i>marks</i>
which the signs leave behind within the acts. To the extent that an act's
directedness is not merely linguistic, however, it will acquire a representative
content that is in whole or in part derived from the objects grasped. Where
we are dealing with acts of ordinary perception such representative content
is of course ultimately just the <i>sensory</i> content of the relevant
acts, a matter of those sensory qualities in the acts which more or less
(according to circumstances) correspond to sensory qualities in the objects
perceived (or to analoguous qualities in internal perception).
<p>Clearly all (used) linguistic expressions yield representative 'marks'
in the first sense. But only certain determinate parts of our expressions
can have something corresponding to them in intuition in the second, 'fulfilling'
sense.<sup>30</sup> Thus if we consider the various simple judgment forms:
<i>A
is P,</i> <i>An S is P</i>, <i>The S is P</i>, <i>All S are P</i>, etc.,
then 'it is easy to see that only at the places indicated by letter- symbols...can
meanings stand that are fulfilled in perception itself.' (II A607/779)
Even where the variables in question replace complex contents, we shall
eventually
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>come down to certain final elements of our terms - we may call
them elements of stuff - which find direct fulfilment in intuition (perception,
imagination, etc.), while the supplementary <i>forms</i>, which as forms
of meaning likewise crave fulfilment, can find nothing that ever could
fit them in perception or acts of like order. (II A607f./779)<sup>31</sup></blockquote>
Or, as the title of &sect; 43 of Husserl's Sixth Investigation expresses
it: 'The objective correlates of categorial forms are not real moments.'
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The "a" and the "the", the "and" and the "or", the "if" and
the "then", the "all" and the "none", the "something" and the "nothing",
the forms of quantity and the determinations of number, etc. - all these
are meaningful propositional elements, but we should look in vain for their
objective correlates (if such may be ascribed to them at all) in the sphere
of <i>real</i> objects, which is in fact no other than the sphere of <i>objects
of possible sense-perception</i>. (II A610f./782)</blockquote>

<p><br>&nbsp;<b>&sect; 9. Categorial Acts and Categorial Objects</b>
<p>Categorial forms include not only the <i>and</i> and the <i>not</i>,
however, but also the <i>is</i>, and this element of the proposition, too,
is incapable of being fulfilled in any mere perceptual act:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>I can see colour, but not <i>being-</i>coloured... Being is
nothing <i>in</i> the object, no part of it, no moment inhering in it;
no quality or intensity, no figure or internal form whatsoever, no constitutive
feature however conceived. (II A609/780)</blockquote>

<p><br>When Husserl talks of 'seeing' here he refers to both outer and
inner perception, and indeed in the title of &sect; 44 of the 6th Investigation
he is concerned to stress - against Brentano - that 'The origin of the
concept of being and of the remaining categories does not lie in the realm
of inner perception'.<sup>32</sup> For unlike Brentano, Husserl is unwilling
to accept that the categorial concepts of logic and formal ontology - concepts
such as being and non-being, unity, plurality, totality, number, ground,
consequence, and so on - should arise through reflection on certain mental
acts. Of course some concepts do arise in this way: 'concepts like <i>perception</i>,
<i>judgment</i>,
<i>affirmation</i>,
<i>denial</i>, <i>collecting</i> and
<i>counting</i>,
<i>presupposing</i>
and <i>inferring</i>' (II A611/782), but these are not the categorial concepts
which lie at the very heart of logic.
<p>'Being is not a judgment nor a real constituent part of a judgment.
Being is as little a real constituent of some inner object as it is of
some outer object' (II A611/782). How, then, do we acquire the formal concept
<i>being</i>,
how do we achieve a fulfilled presentation of the corresponding formal-ontological
category? How, indeed, do we achieve a more than merely empty or signitive
grasp of any categorial object, whether it be a species or categorial form?<sup>33</sup>
Such an object can be given to us in a fulfilled way, Husserl insists,
only on the basis of an individual presenting act which sets some individual
instance before our eyes. But this 'analogue of common sensuous intuition'
(II A613/784) for categorial objects is not by any means a straightforward
matter. Categorial objects can be presented in a fulfilled manner only
by appeal to a certain kind of complex cognitive processing.
<p>Individual sensible objects are <i>immediately given</i>, 'not <i>constituted</i>
in relational, connective, or in any other acts, acts founded on further
acts which bring objects from elsewhere to appearance. Sensuous objects
are present in perception in a single act level' (II A618/787). Categorial
objects, in contrast, need to be made present in a more complex process
involving acts on several levels: 'An aggregate, e.g., is given, and can
only be given, in an actual act of grasping together, an act which comes
to expression in the form of the conjunctive connection <i>A and B and
C and</i>...' The concept <i>aggregate</i> does not, however, arise through
reflection on this act, but through reflection 'on the aggregate it makes
apparent <i>in concreto</i>' (II A613f./784).
<p>This is clearest in the case of those categorial acts in which we move
from some sensible, material object to the corresponding material species
or universal. This is not, as is too often supposed in the more superficial
commentaries on Husserl, a matter of some special kind of 'vision', directed
towards extra-worldly Platonic objects in the same way that sensory perception
is directed toward ordinary objects in the material world. The categorial
act which enables our apprehension of the species is, like all other categorial
acts, a <i>founded</i> act. And the lower order acts on which it is founded
are in this case (1) acts of perception of certain specific moments in
the things perceived, (2) acts of apprehension of these moments as standing
in certain relations of exact similarity, of identity in this or that respect,
and (3) a founded act of presenting the species that is rooted in this
identity.<sup>34</sup>
<p>How, now, do things stand in regard to the apprehension of states of
affairs? Here we are normally only signitively directed to the object in
question: the state of affairs is the direct objectual correlate not of
a straightforward act of perception but of an act of judgment, an act linguistically
clothed. We <i>can</i> be directed towards a state of affairs in a fulfilled
way, not however by reflecting on judgments, but only 'through the fulfilments
of judgments themselves' (II A613/784).
<p>Consider, for example, our apprehension of the state of affairs <i>that
a is part of A</i>. We have here first of all a straightforward act directed
towards <i>A</i>, an act in which <i>A</i> 'stands simply before us: the
parts which constitute it are indeed in it, but they do not become our
explicit objects in straightforward acts'. The same object
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>can however be grasped by us in explicating fashion: in acts
of articulation we put its parts 'into relief', in relational acts we bring
the relieved parts into relation, whether to one another or to the whole.
And only through these new modes of conception do the connected and related
members gain the character of 'parts' or of 'wholes'. (II A624f./792)</blockquote>
Thus we must consider now a pair of acts of perception, trained, respectively,
upon <i>A</i> and upon its part or moment <i>A</i>, in such a way that
the two acts
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>are not merely performed simultaneously or one after the other
in the manner of disconnected experiences; rather they are bound together
in a single act and it is only in the synthesis of this act that A appears
as containing <i>A</i> within itself. Just so, <i>A</i> can, with a reversal
of the direction of relational perception, appear as pertaining to A. (II
A625/793)</blockquote>

<p><br>This 'direction of relational perception' is a new species of act-moment
having its own determinate 'phenomenological character' and making its
own determinate contribution to the matter of the relating act. In the
present case there are clearly two such 'directions', two possibilities
'in which the "same relation" can achieve actual givenness' but only 'in
founded acts of the indicated sort' (II A626/794).
<p>The same two-fold possibility is present also in the case of states
of affairs involving <i>external</i> relations such as <i>A is to the right
of B</i>, <i>A is larger, brighter, louder than B</i>. The formal (and
material) ontology of these relations, too, can be most adequately understood
within the context of a theory of part, whole and dependence of the Husserlian
sort. The states of affairs in question may arise wherever independently
perceivable objects
<blockquote>find themselves together - regardless of their mutually separate
self-containedness - in association with each other, in more or less intimate
unities, i.e. into what are at bottom more comprehensive objects. They
all fall under the general type of the relation <i>part to parts within
a whole</i>. And once more it is founded acts in which the primary appearance
of the states of affairs in question... is achieved. (II A627/794f.)</blockquote>
Suppose, to take another example, we perceive in sensation the <i>contact</i>
of two objects <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>B, their sharing a common boundary
within a more comprehensive whole:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>we grasp the contact and perhaps express it in the synthetic
forms '<i>A</i> is in contact with <i>B</i>', or '<i>B</i> is in contact
with <i>A</i>'. With the constitution of the latter forms, however, new
objects arise, belonging to the class of 'states of affairs', which includes
only 'objects of higher order'. In the sensible whole, the parts <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> are made one by the sensuously connecting form of contact.
But the setting into relief of these parts and moments, the formation of
intuitions of <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and of the <i>contact</i>, will not yet
yield the presentation <i>A is in contact with B</i>. This demands a novel
act which, taking charge of such presentations, shapes and connects them
in an appropriate way. (II A628/795)</blockquote>

<p><br>As is well known, Brentano defended the view that all acts of judging
presuppose, that is to say are founded on, acts of presentation. Brentano
however insisted that the presentational acts which occur in the context
of a judgment are in every case capable of existing in separation from
this context, i.e. that the very same presentational act could in principle
occur both alone and in the structure of a judgment. This view, as Husserl
puts it, involves 'a confusion of two utterly different species of foundation'
(II A462/651). On the one hand we have that sort of foundation which obtains
between an act of joy provoked e.g. by the perception of some pretty girl,
and this very perception itself, a foundation of one act upon another,
separate act. On the other hand we have that sort of foundation which is
involved within the locus of a single complex act, for example between
the matter of a judgment and the matters of the constituent presentations
or nominal acts.<sup>35</sup> Reflection on such cases reveals that, as
already noted in &sect; 2 above, presenting acts existing on their own
and what might appear to be the same presenting acts serving as the terms
of a judgmental whole <i>are not really the same acts</i>. Thus in the
move from presentations of <i>A</i> and of <i>B</i> to a judgment such
as <i>A is in contact with B</i>,
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>it is not as if some intervening additional piece had been
shoved in between the unchanged presentations, a bond, which would combine
the presentations together in a merely external fashion. The function of
synthetic thought (the intellective function) does something to them, shapes
them anew, although, being a categorial function, it has done this in categorial
fashion, so that the sensuous content... remains unaltered. (II A629/796)</blockquote>
Moreover, what applies to the acts applies also to the objects presented.
Thus the object <i>A</i> or <i>B</i> on becoming inserted into the new
relational complex
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>does not appear before us with new real properties; it stands
before us as this same object, but in a <i>new manner</i>. Its becoming
fitted into the categorial context gives it a definite place and role,
the role of a <i>relatum</i>, more particularly of a subject- or object-member;
and these are differences that manifest themselves phenomenologically.
(II A629/796)<sup>36</sup></blockquote>

<p><br>In fact we have a quite general parallelism of the structures of
meaning and object in relation to all categorial phenomena. Thus to the
categories of meaning distinguishable within the simple proposition there
correspond categories on the side of the object such as relatum, relation,
subject, object, etc., distinguishable within the state of affairs. And
to each of the higher order meaning categories there correspond new categorial
object-forms relating to complex states of affairs and to combination-forms
such as <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>both</i>, <i>either</i>, <i>because</i>,
<i>if</i>,
and so on.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 10. Categorial Perception, Evidence and Truth</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Categorial perception is conceived by Husserl as a true analogue to
ordinary sensory perception. As already stated, this is not because categorial
acts have their own determinate objects of direct intention.<sup>37</sup>
The analogy obtains, rather, because categorial acts share with ordinary
judgments and presentations the three essential features of quality, matter
and representative content, the latter being here also that moment which
'makes up the difference between "empty" signification and "full" intuition'
(II A643/808).
<p>But what <i>is</i> the representative content in the case of categorial
acts? It is provided, Husserl argues, by the very <i>acts</i> of categorial
shaping themselves, acts of collecting, identifying, connecting, setting
into relief, and so on. That is, it is provided by the very operation of
that cognitive processing on the basis of which the given categorial objects
are set before us in the first place. The directedness to a categorial
object is therefore a fulfilled directedness to the extent that the complex
acts necessary for the setting forth of the given object are in fact carried
out. A fulfilled directedness to a species, for example, occurs only if
parts or moments of given objects standing in relations of exact similarity
are in fact picked out and the objects grasped as identical in this or
that respect, so that their (qualitative) identity can itself be made into
an object in a process of what Husserl calls 'ideating abstraction'. A
fulfilled directedness to an aggregate occurs only if given individual
objects are in fact brought together in actually executed collecting acts.
A fulfilled directedness to a state of affairs occurs only if given objects
or determinations are not merely perceived together but grasped determinately
in a judgment, and in such a way that we have an experience of agreement
between the meaning of our judgment and the state of affairs which corresponds
thereto.
<p>But now, Husserl argues, when a state of affairs is given in this manner,
then our acts correspondingly add up to what he calls an evident judgment,
an experience which has the peculiar property that it instantiates that
quite special sort of species which we call a truth. For each single truth
<i>is</i>
a species whose instances are fulfilled experiences of states of affairs,
cases of correspondence between fulfilled meaning act and meant object.<sup>38</sup>
<p>When a given state of affairs is given to us in a fulfilled manner,
then a certain truth is instantiated. We can reflect on this instantiation
and perform an act of grasping the species involved, so that the truth
itself becomes our apprehended object. 'We hereby apprehend - through ideating
abstraction - the truth as the ideal correlate of the transient subjective
act of cognition, as one [ideal singular] over against the unlimited manifold
of possible cognitive acts and of knowing individuals.' (I A230/227)
<p>One could in principle apprehend in this way a whole theory, a whole
deductively closed collection of truths, for here, too, there is an opposition
between the ideally identical theory as a structure of truths on the one
hand set over against an array of dispersed evident judgings on the other.
The fulfilled apprehension of an entire theory, however, and therefore
also of an entire domain of scientific objects, is ruled out by factual
constraints on consciousness. Our properly scientific knowledge is always
partial and incomplete, as contrasted with that direct knowledge of objects
which is vouchsafed to us through inner and outer perception. Scientific
knowledge is indeed a cognitive possession that survives even when the
relevant objects are not themselves present to the cognising subject. And
as Dallas Willard points out in his remarkably sophisticated study of this
aspect of Husserl's logic, the absence of the relevant objects is 'of necessity
the normal case in scientifically organized research and knowledge' (Willard
1984, p.12). This partiality, too, may be made the object of its own kind
of theoretical investigation, an investigation of the various different
ways in which our cognitive acts may fall short of the ideal of theory
or of knowledge in the strict and proper sense. And indeed Husserl's framework
provides us with the means not only for investigating the structures of
a science as a deductively closed collection of fulfilled cognitions and
validations <i>in specie</i>, but also for coming to an understanding of
the nature and status of the various definitions, algorithms and other
auxiliary devices which enable the scientist to economise on cognitive
fulfilments in more or less justified ways. Willard's study, which sets
new standards of scholarship in work on the early Husserl, is now the definitive
treatment of this aspect of Husserl's theory of science.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 11. Categorial Shaping</b>
<p>The world has a certain sensible, material stuff. Within this stuff
we can, if we strain our mental eyes, pick out certain categorial objects.
By means of suitable acts of relating or of setting into relief we can
make out certain higher order formally determined structures and we can
carve out for ourselves new objects by cleaving the relevant matters along
formally determined contour lines.<sup>39</sup> The material stuff of the
world thereby serves as immediate foundation for the categorially shaped
objects which result.
<p>This process can however be carried forward. The operations involved
in categorial shaping can be iterated, so that the objects of categorial
acts are themselves subjected to further categorial shaping of higher order:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>categorial unities may again and again become the objects of
new connecting, relating or ideating acts. Thus for example universal objects
can be collectively connected, the collections thereby formed then again
connected with other collections of similar or different type, and so on
<i>in
infinitum</i>. (II A653/816)</blockquote>

<p><br>The resulting higher order categorial acts can indeed be such that
the sensory material with which we started is no longer present even in
a subsidiary way in the contents of the acts in question. This is the sense
of Husserl's designation of the categorial disciplines as 'pure':
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Like the whole of pure logic, so all pure arithmetic, the pure
theory of manifolds, in short the pure mathesis in the all- embracing sense,
are pure in the sense that they contain no sensuous concept in their entire
theoretical fabric. (II A656/819)</blockquote>
Categorial shaping is a purely intellectual matter. But the objects it
picks out are not denizens of any separate, purely intellectual realm.
It is, rather, as if these objects sit on top of the perceptual world in
such a way as to leave all the real, sensory structures and all the real
unities which lie beneath them unaffected.<sup>40</sup> Thus categorial
forms do not glue, tie or put real parts together so that new sensuously
perceivable wholes would emerge. The relating and connecting, the setting
into focus and the drawing of boundaries that is involved in categorial
processing merely sets up a new <i>view</i> [<i>Fassung</i>] of what is
intuited on the primary level of sensory acts, a view which 'can be given
<i>only</i>
in such a founded act, so that the [Platonistic] idea of a straightforward
perception of that which has been formed or of a givenness through some
other straightforward intuition, is absurd.' (II A658/820) From this it
follows however that - as far as concerns the world of what happens and
is the case - categorial shaping <i>leaves everything as it is</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>It is not, however, as if the categorially perceiving intellect enjoys
complete freedom in his forming and shaping:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The very fact that the categorial forms constitute themselves
in founded characters of acts, and in these alone, involves a certain necessity
of connection. How, otherwise, could we speak of categorial <i>perception</i>
and <i>intuition</i>, if any conceivable matter could be put into any conceivable
form, i.e. if the founding straightforward intuitions permitted themselves
to be arbitrarily connected together with categorial characters? (II A660/821)</blockquote>

<p><br>The insistence on the possibility of fulfilment - in fact of a complex
chain of fulfilments leading back, ultimately, to sensory intuitions -
imposes quite determinate constraints on the shaping that is possible on
the higher categorial levels. Indeed there are laws governing the possibility
and impossibility of combination and iteration of categorial operations
that are analogous to the laws governing the combination of meanings on
the level of pure grammar, laws having their origins in what is possible
and impossible in virtue of the compatibilities among acts of identification,
collection, setting into relief, and so on, in relation to given foundations.
We cannot convert a part- whole relationship into a relationship of discrete
items and preserve the possibility of adequate fulfilment. Such examples
point to a family of laws governing the transformation of meanings, for
example from '<i>w is a part of W</i>' to '<i>W is a whole relative to
w</i>', from '<i>a certain A is B</i>' to '<i>not all A's are not B's</i>',
and so on, in such a way that the possibility of fulfilment is preserved.<sup>41</sup>
Because the species of material foundations hereby involved 'are quite
freely variable and are only subject to the obvious ideal condition of
capacity to function as carriers of the relevant forms, the laws in question
are of an entirely pure and analytic character' (II A661/822). They hold
in abstraction from all sensuous stuff, 'and are accordingly not capable
of being affected at all by limitless variation of such stuff' (II A672/831).
Hence they do not need grounding in experience, and it is senseless to
suppose that the world might somehow fail to satisfy them: 'Laws which
refer to no fact cannot be confirmed or refuted by fact.'
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>There is need of no metaphysical or other sorts of theories
to
explain the harmony of the course of nature and the 'inborn' laws of 'understanding':
instead of an explanation one needs merely a phenomenological clarification
of meaning, thinking and knowing and of the ideas and laws which spring
from these. (II A671f./830)</blockquote>

<p><br>In the theoretical domain of logic proper we are concerned exclusively
with <i>authentic</i> thinking, with cognitive acts and processes capable
of corresponding in the full sense to objects, i.e. of being bound up 'with
an intuition which fulfils them totally and singly' (II A666/826). But
there are of course free and easy categorial acts which are a matter of
mere signitive directedness to categorial objects already constituted.
Indeed we might entirely abandon the insistence on fulfilment, and rest
content with an empty categorial forming and shaping, a forming and shaping
which does not understand itself and which can take place fully <i>ad libitum</i>.
We could then talk purely signitively about (even build entire axiom systems
relating to) the square root of Napoleon's hat, or the part-whole relations
between Wellington's boots and the mother of my umbrella. For in the sphere
of inauthentic thinking, of mere signification, 'we are free of all constraint
by categorial laws. Here anything and everything can be brought together
in unity.' (II A666/826)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&sect; 12. Conclusion</b>
<p>One indication of the powerful economy of Husserl's theory is provided
by his treatment of the traditional notions of the analytic and the synthetic
in terms of the opposition between <i>formal</i> and <i>material</i> concepts
and categories. Analytic propositions are those propositions which express
purely formal truths (truths which apply to all objects whatever their
material make-up or qualitative determinations) and all the specialisations
thereof which arise through substitution of particular material concepts.<sup>42</sup>
Synthetic propositions are propositions which cannot be converted to formal
truths by any process of substituting variables for the simple or complex
material concepts they contain. The basic laws of logic and formal ontology
are in every case analytic and are in this sense 'trivial generalities'.
Indeed, Husserl castigates 'the old rationalism' because it
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>could not get clear about the fact that logical principles
are no more than trivial generalities, with which an assertion may not
clash on pain of being <i>absurd</i>, and that therefore also the harmony
of thought with these norms guarantees no more than its formal consistency.
(I A140/157)</blockquote>

<p><br>Logic and formal ontology themselves, however, are not entirely
empty. They first of all enable us to tie together trivialities, which
might otherwise seem random and unmotivated, into the framework of a <i>theory</i>.<sup>43</sup>
But then also they have the utterly non-trivial task of getting clear about
the fundamental categories upon which their respective laws are based,
the 'categories essential to all science as such', and this is a matter
not of logical laws in the strict sense (and not even of analytic truths)
but of a more global, structural description of the entire domain of knowledge
and cognition.<sup>44</sup> This task of clarification has been all but
forgotten by modern logicians, whose efforts have been directed almost
exclusively to the working out of certain sorts of mathematical properties
of more or less arbitrarily constructed formal systems of a merely conventional
character. The status of these efforts and their relevance to logic as
theory of science is never clarified, and is in practice nil.<sup>45</sup>
<p>That the task of clarification is still not by any means completed will
become clear if we consider the status of concepts such as <i>thinker</i>,
<i>thinking
act</i>, <i>expression</i>, <i>use of language</i>. Are these concepts
formal or material? And how are they related to a concept such as <i>human
being</i>? Husserl himself seems to suggest that it is a relatively incidental
matter that the laws of authentic thinking apply also to human thinking,
for he sees such laws as being rooted in the character of acts purely as
instances of the relevant ideal species: they are laws which 'pertain to
all possible organisations which could be built up out of acts of like
species' (II A669/828). But what are these 'possible organisations'? Are
they, as Husserl's doctrine of formal concepts would seem to imply, realisable
in a range of structures other than those to be found within the organic
realm? Are they, for example, realisable within the locus of a machine?
<p>Logic as Husserl conceives it is a science of certain privileged species
in the sphere of both meanings and objects and of the relations holding
between these and between the ideal singulars which they comprehend. At
the very centre of Husserl's account, therefore, is the notion of species,
and it is clear that the account will work only to the extent that this
notion is itself well-founded. Now there is species only where objects
manifest total qualitative identity in this or that respect: this is what
talk of 'species' means. Such identity is manifested, for example, between
two patches of red of an exactly similar hue. On the level of empirical
individuals, however, exact similarity of this sort is comparatively rare:
we find it among the elementary data of sense, and in the sphere of phenomenology
(of mental acts, their qualities, matters, and contents) in general, and
for example in relation to certain phenomena in the realm of action.<sup>46</sup>
Where we do <i>not</i> find it is in relation to a species such as <i>dog</i>.
As already noted however, when we leave behind the sphere of empirical
individuals and consider the higher order categorial objects in the region
of the 'pure' or 'theoretical' sciences, then perfect similarity is no
longer at a premium. Thus where, above all, we are dealing with the mathematical
sciences, then Husserl's doctrine seems to be on firm ground. And the same
applies to those sciences, both logic itself and various branches of theoretical
linguistics, where we are dealing with structures of meanings in abstraction
from particular occasions of use.
<p>Husserl's logic thereby provides us with a means of abandoning conventionalism
in logic and in surrounding spheres. It gives us an account of what the
subject-matter of logic is, in terms of the actually existing patterns
of identity and difference, of constancy and variation, within the realm
of meanings. Moreover, it provides us with a means of providing, in a way
which does not involve compromising the necessity of logic, an account
of the relations between logical laws and empirical acts of thinking and
inferring.
<p>But what, now, is left of our first approximate account of the nature
of a scientific theory as an organised collection of mental acts? We have
reached the point were we can see that logic as full theory of science
must be taken in a wider sense, as including not merely the theory of acts
and of meanings - including the 'pure logical grammar of meaning categories'
- but also the various branches of formal ontology. For there are of course
more bits and pieces involved in the practice of a science than simply
mental acts, and Husserl's <i>Logical Investigations</i> is surely still,
after more than 80 years, the most detailed and the most realistic study
of the ways in which these various bits and pieces hang together.

obtained is to conceive it as a structure of propositions as these would

the ideal case - inherit the structure of the judgments they are designed
to express, something which led Bolzano to define logic as the science
of constructing perfect scientific textbooks. It is a version of this Bolzanian
view which survives in the modern logical conception of sciences as sets
of propositions abstractly conceived.</sup>

a unity of meaning, and if logic is the science of theoretic unity in general,

which are grounded purely in the latter and which are therefore ideal.'
(II A93/323)</sup>
<p><a NAME="N_13_"></a><sup>13. The fact that objects may be either individual
(empirical) or general (ideal), and that the presentations in which we
mean them may be such that their objects are meant either as singulars
or <i>in general</i>, gives rise to four different kinds of judgment:</sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><sup>- singular judgments about what is individual: <i>Socrates is a
man</i>,</sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><sup>- singular judgments about what is general: <i>Two is an even number</i>,

<br>&nbsp;
<p><sup>- general judgments about what is individual: <i>All men are mortal</i>,</sup>

lost if we attempt to translate Husserl's talk of species and instance
into the more popular vocabulary of 'types' and 'tokens'.</sup>

type of complexity to admit of definition, and therefore it, too, is a
categorial concept, a fact which formed the basis of Husserl's criticisms
of Frege's theory of number in the <i>Philosophie der Arithmetik</i>, e.g.
on p.119. See also Willard 1984, p.66.</sup>
