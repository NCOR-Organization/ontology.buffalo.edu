  <p><b><font size="+1">Introduction</font></b> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">I shall presuppose as undefended background to what
follows a position of scientific realism, a doctrine to the effect (i) that
the world exists and (ii) that through the working out of ever more sophisticated 
theories our scientific picture of reality will approximate ever more closely 
to the world as it really is. Against this background consider, now, the following
question:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">1. Do the empirical theories with the help of which 
we seek to approximate a good or true picture of reality rest on any non-empirical 
presuppositions?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">One can answer this question with either a 'yes' or a 'no'. 
'No' is the preferred answer of most contemporary methodologists -- Murray 
Rothbard is one distinguished counterexample to this trend -- who maintain 
that empirical theories are completely free of non-empirical ('a priori') 
admixtures and who see science as a matter of the gathering of pure 'data' 
obtained through simple observation. From such data scientific propositions 
are then supposed to be somehow capable of being established.</font> 
  <p><font size="+1">It is one solid result of modern philosophy of science 
that no such conception of the way scientific knowledge is gained and scientific 
hypotheses formulated can be acceptable. The philosophy of science has shown
that certain categories (conceptions, hypotheses, assumptions) are necessarily
presupposed if, for example, an empirical observation is to be scientifically
usable. Every observation is in this sense 'theory-' or at least 'category-laden'.
One cannot measure anything, and one can bring no results of measurement
into correlation with one another, if one does not have prior concepts or
categories of what one wants to measure.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">To carry out experiments in meaningful and systematic 
fashion, to represent the results of these experiments theoretically, and 
to process these results one needs assumptions, concepts, categories and other
theoretical instruments. Logic and the theory of definition, as well as many
branches of pure mathematics belong to this pre-empirical foundation of the
empirical sciences -- 'pre-empirical' in the sense that it cannot be gained
through induction or observation but rather makes induction and observation
possible.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">All scientists bring with them non-empirical presuppositions 
of different sorts, presuppositions which are usually tacit in nature, which
will often seem trivial when made explicit, and which will therefore no less
often lend sanction to the view that they are somehow empty or analytic,
that they are all without exception derived from logic. Most twentieth-century
philosophers of science have indeed assumed as a matter of course that scientific
theories ought properly to consist entirely of empirical propositions (propositions
amenable to empirical testing) built up on a foundation of strictly analytic
propositions of logic and mathematics. This leads to the further question:</font>
 <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">2. Are the propositions which express the pre-empirical 
assumptions of empirical science in every case analytic (tautological, lacking
in content)?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">'Yes', say the logical positivists. Logic, and all that
one can derive from logic, together with conventional definitions, suffice 
in their view for the purposes of this non-empirical part of science. Many 
later analytic philosophers have also believed that this logical-positivist 
conception of the indispensable non-empirical foundation of science is the
only one that can be seriously entertained. They have not, however, noticed,
that the corresponding analyses even of the simplest examples of non-empirical
propositions have still to be provided. Indeed, they let the matter rest
at programmatic declarations and did not care about providing examples of
any sort.</font> 
  <p><font size="+1">Consider for example the law of the transitivity of
the part-whole relation.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">This law reads as follows:</font> </p>
  <center> 
  <p><font size="+1">[TRANS] If A is a part of B, and B a part of C, then
A is also a part of C.</font></p>
  </center>
  
  <p><font size="+1">It may be that some of us may recognize a point in our 
lives when we first apprehended this law. But still, it is difficult seriously 
to entertain the thesis that our knowledge of the law is a result of empirical 
research, of observation and induction. The proposition in question is however
clearly of extraordinary importance for every science and for every scientific
experiment. Like many other laws pertaining to the simplest and most general
relational categories, it is at the same time also entirely trivial. Now
it is a common peculiarity of human beings that they like to turn away from
trivial or elementary propositions of this sort and that they have a tendency
to refuse to accept their peculiarities and their consequences: 'trop de
v&eacute;rit&eacute; nous &eacute;tonne', as Pascal once formulated the matter.<sup><a href="#N_3_">
(3)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Who, after all, is interested in the fact that human
action exists, that pleasure is different from greed, that triangles are
different from squares, that warnings are different from congratulatings,
that Julius Caesar is not a cardinal number. It is for this reason possible
that both philosophers and scientists have often overlooked the fact that
all normal human beings are in possession of a whole host of such items of
knowledge or insight. And for this reason also the temptation very easily
arises to want to devalue such propositions by classifying them as 'analytic' 
or 'tautological' or 'lacking in content'.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">The law of the transitivity of the part-whole relation 
is however - for all its triviality - not analytic according to the standard 
reading of this notion. According to this standard reading we are to define 
'analytic' as follows:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">A proposition is analytic if and only if it is either 
itself a law of deductive logic or it is capable of being transformed into 
such a law through the replacement of the defined terms it contains with corresponding
definitions.</font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1"><i>All bachelors are unmarried </i>can be exhibited as analytic 
in this sense by substituting 'unmarried man' for 'bachelor' and noting that
the result is an instance of the logical law <i>All A which are B are B.</i></font>
 
  <p><font size="+1">[TRANS], now, contains just one term which might come 
into question as 'defined', namely the relational term 'is a part of'. This
expression is not a logical term; axioms governing the corresponding relation
will be found in no standard logical textbook, and neither will [TRANS] itself.
Unfortunately for the advocates of the logical positivist conception, however,
it is also not definable. Rather it presents an example of one of those fundamental
concepts with whose help the very process of defining scientific terms can
sensibly begin.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">According to the definition of 'analytic' that is standardly 
accepted by logical positivists and by analytic philosophers in general, then,
the given law is synthetic. But might one not call into question the preferred
definition of 'analytic'? Might one not, with Carnap and others, assert that
the truth of a proposition such as [TRANS] is somehow a consequence of the
rules of language?<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">[TRANS] would then be lacking in content in the sense 
that it would have nothing to do with the actual world but rather only with
our language. Yet the given law would clearly still obtain even if no language
or rules of language should ever have evolved; indeed it would clearly still
obtain even in a world lacking all cognitive subjects. Even then it would
still for example be true that, of three arbitrary parts of a stone, or of
a planet, if the first is part of the second, and the second part of the
third, then the first is also part of the third. To conceive the law of transitivity
as 'lacking in content' in the suggested fashion is therefore at least a
mite more problematic than the defenders of the corresponding theories have
normally supposed.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">For this reason I shall assume in what follows that
at least some of those non-empirical assumptions or hypotheses which are
presupposed by the various branches of science are not analytic. The question
then arises:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">3. Do we have an infallible knowledge of all the synthetic 
pre-empirical propositions which are presupposed by the various sciences in
the different phases of their development?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">Already for purely logical reasons it is impossible that 
one should answer 'yes' to this question. For such pre-empirical assumptions 
have not always remained the same through the course of scientific development, 
and successive assumptions have not always been consistent with one another. 
As is shown by the developments of the last one hundred years in the relations 
between geometry and physics, the results of empirical research sometimes 
seem to exercise a retroactive control over pre-empirical assumptions and 
lead to their elimination or modification. The realm of the pre-empirical 
thus provides no royal road to indubitable knowledge. Much rather is synthetic 
pre-empirical knowledge a hard-fought achievement, and those who seek such 
knowledge must be ready to face many detours and setbacks on the way.</font>
 
  <p><font size="+1">For the same (logical) reasons we should have to deny 
the thesis that the synthetic pre-empirical propositions at the core of science
might all be true. Even in the realm of the pre-empirical there is no infallible
knowledge and no truth-guarantee. We are dealing here with 'assumptions'
in a strict sense of the word, assumptions which may, even if only in isolated
instances, turn out to be false. Interestingly, traces of this fallibilistic
conception of the a priori are present in Husserl, and already Leibniz spoke
of a 'methodus conjecturalis a priori', which proceeds with the aid of hypotheses:
'[assumere] causas licet sine ulla probatione'.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">With this, however, there arises the following question:</font>
 <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">4. Could these assumptions be arbitrary?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">Feyerabend has given a positive answer to this question, 
propounding what he calls an 'anarchistic theory of knowledge' and abandoning 
the scientific goal of truth in favour of a position of epistemological relativism.
Feyerabend calls for a maximally broad and 'ever increasing <i>ocean of mutually
incompatible (and perhaps even incommensurable) alternatives' - </i>of alternative
counter- intuitive (and also 'counter-inductive') theories (1975, p. 30).
As soon, however, as we attempt to imagine in concrete fashion what it would
mean to practice science (or anything else) consciously and consistently
according to the policy of arbitrariness, then we recognize that Feyerabend's
doctrine of 'anything goes' is entirely indefensible. For however large and
important the role of serendipity in science may be, it is surely obvious
that the idea that scientists could apply arbitrary assumptions is impracticable.
Even those who hold falsification to be the primary motor of scientific development
must insist that the falsification of <i>arbitrary</i> assumptions would
be a fruitless enterprise.</font> 
  <p><font size="+1">This, however, implies that there must be some criteria 
of evaluation which the scientist applies, whether consciously or not, in
working out his assumptions, or through which he allows himself to be guided
in determining which assumptions are and are not acceptable.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">How, then, does this evaluation of scientific assumptions 
proceed? The answer to this question that is favoured by the positivists is
in its simplest version as follows: we evaluate assumptionsexclusively according
to their consequences, i.e. according to the principle of expedience or predictive
power. We establish in other words that certain assumptions yield assertions
about the future which are empirically confirmed - or at least not easily
falsified.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">A position of this sort is defended for example by Milton 
Friedman, at least in his methodological writings (especially his 1953). Friedman
maintains that assumptions can be completely arbitrary, that they can even
be false, if they only enjoy a certain power to generate predictions. It
might for example turn out that an economic theory was developed which correlated
stock-market movements with sun-spot activity, and then, so long as this
theory enjoyed predictive power, it would as theory be fully acceptable.
For the positivists, science evolves by becoming ever more concentrated on
assumptions with predictive power. Theories and hypotheses which prove unreliable
will be slowly filtered out.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">We have accepted already that there can in this sense 
be a control even of the pre-empirical assumptions adopted by the natural 
sciences. This can indeed be counted as a scientific commonplace. The corresponding 
process of filtering out however, whether it is understood according to the
classical model of empirical confirmation or according to the Popperian model
of falsification, because it is purely retrospective in nature, does not
take us further with respect to the just-mentioned problem of arbitrariness. 
The question of criteria of <i>ex ante</i> evaluation thus remains extent 
open (a consequence which we could incidentally have predicted, if we had 
kept in mind the example of pure mathematics, in which pre- (or non-)empirical 
assumptions are equally necessary, but where talk of predictive power is clearly
inappropriate).</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">For it is of course not the case that the scientist
occupies himself with arbitrary assumptions in the hope - and to the extent
that the relevant assumptions were truly arbitrary this would have to be
a groundless hope - that they will manifest in unexpected fashion a high
predictive power. No scientist would ever consciously rely on pure arbitrariness
in this fashion. The search for assumptions on the part of the scientist
is subject rather to a whole host of <i>ex ante</i> (or as we might also
say: a priori) controls. For he seeks only those assumptions which will give 
him a <i>justified</i> expectation of predictive power. The sun-spot example 
fails to awaken such expectations precisely because we can find no intelligible 
reason why sun-spots should cause stock-exchange movements. Even if we were
to accept such a correlation as a fact, we would still be unsatisfied with
the corresponding hypothesis, because we would feel no certainty that this
correlation might not at any moment cease to obtain. Certainty of this sort
is acquired only where we have some explanation as to <i>why</i> these and
those stock-exchange phenomena are associated in a non-arbitrary  fashion
with these and those sun-spot phenomena.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">What, then, are the criteria of <i>ex ante</i> evaluation 
which serve to temper arbitrariness? Here there is much that is to be said 
- for instance that our assumptions must in the normal case stand to other 
accepted assumptions in relations of logical consistency. For our present 
purposes however it will suffice to point out that these assumptions must, 
in general at least, be characterized by a certain plausibility. Scientists 
attempt to find assumptions in relation to which they can have a justified 
expectation that they be true.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">This holds not least for the category of synthetic pre- 
empirical assumptions. Indeed we want to claim that with the development of
science the relevant synthetic pre-empirical propositions must come to be
characterized by such plausibility to an ever increasing degree.Then, however,
the question arises:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">5. Might this sort of plausibility be always a contextual 
affair, so that an 'intrinsic' plausibility would be excluded?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">It is commonly held that nothing is in itself plausible, 
that what one finds plausible depends always on one's presuppositions, perhaps
also on certain background features of one's society or language, on the
current state of the sciences, and so on. The thesis that all the pre-empirical
propositions that are of interest to us here might enjoy only this sort of
context-determined (perhaps we might call it 'hermeneutical') plausibility,
is however rather improbable. I cannot, for example, imagine what it would
be like for the plausibility of [TRANS] to be context-dependent in the suggested
sense. [TRANS] is clearly accepted by all scientists, and it is presupposed
also, it seems, in many of the simplest and most common human activities
in all cultures, and it seems to be associated with no specific types of
scientific problem or subject-matter. Moreover, it would similarly be difficult
to conceive of a purely context-dependent plausibility for propositions like
  <i>red is different from green</i> or<i> seeing is different from hearing.</i></font>
 
  <p><font size="+1">There are, it follows, intrinsically plausible pre-empirical 
assumptions which play an indispensable (if often trivial) role in the advance
of science and knowledge. In the philosophical literature on the topic of
the a priori it is usually only certain selected examples of such propositions
which are treated of, so that it can easily appear as if they could each
be shown in turn to be 'analytic' or 'tautological' by some manipulation
of definitions.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a>
  </sup></font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">The question however arises:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">6. <i>Whether the intrinsically plausible pre-empirical 
synthetic propositions which play an indispensable role in the sciences are
truly given only individually, i.e. in such a way that there obtains no systematic
relation between them?</i></font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">Kant answered this question in the negative in that the
whole of arithmetic and of physics are based in his eyes on synthetic pre-empirical 
presuppositions. In the last hundred years it has however come to be taken 
for granted in the literature that we have to deal here with only single, 
unconnected propositions. Thus for example the logical positivists, in their
attempts to demonstrate the analyticity of all pre-empirical assumptions, 
have over and over again worked with the same few examples: the law of cause
and effect, the proposition that nothing can be red and green all over -
examples which, in their isolation, can be dismissed as being of at most
curiosity interest and of negligible scientific import. A more careful investigation
shows, however, that there are whole systems of such pre-empirical propositions,
even leaving aside the examples to which Kant himself paid special attention.
Not only is mereology a self-contained science of the laws of part and whole,<sup><a href="#N_8_">
(8)</a>
  </sup></font> 
  <p><font size="+1">there are also other sciences - or 'pre-sciences' (<i>
Vorwissenschaften</i>) as Husserl's teacher Stumpf called them<sup><a href="#N_9_">
(9)</a>
  </sup></font> <font size="+1">- which consist exclusively in intrinsically
plausible pre-empirical principles. Stumpf himself offers as examples what
he called 'phenomenology' (which he defined as the theory of sensible phenomena),
'eidology' (the theory of non-sensory 'formations' given in experience, including
value- and Gestalt-formations), and the 'general theory of relations' (the
theory of relational concepts such as 'similarity, equality, intensity, logical
and real dependence, the relation of part and whole, and so on' (<i>op. cit.,</i>
 p. 37. These pre-sciences are according to Stumpf:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">the atrium und the organon of every other science insofar 
as the object of every science includes their object, since all research makes
use of relational concepts and laws ... In an ideal encyclopedia of knowledge
everything which can be said about relations between arbitrary elements in
general would have to come first (<i>Op. cit., </i>p. 39).</font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">There are therefore, if Stumpf is right, whole systems of 
synthetic assumptions of a non-empirical sort, assumptions which enjoy an
intrinsic plausibility and which play an important (even if easily overlooked) 
role in the sciences.</font> 
  <p><font size="+1">Husserl himself held that there were three a priori
ontologies, three 'material a priori sciences' of thing, soul, and society:
the pure science of nature, pure psychology and pure sociology, respectively.
The ontology of things includes as branches the pure theory of space (geometry), 
pure time theory (chronometry), pure kinematics, and the pure disciplines 
of the possible deformations of spatial formations. The pure a priori science 
of the soul, first called by Husserl 'descriptive psychology' and associated 
with the 'rational psychology' of Christian Wolff has as its subject-matter 
the psychical experiences, perceptions, memories, imagination, expectations, 
decisions, choices, and so on, in other words thought experiences of every 
sort, as well as feelings and acts of will. The regional ontology of society, 
finally, concerns itself with cultural formations like state, law, custom, 
church and so on. (Schuhmann 1990)</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Husserl's early followers in Munich, the so-called 'realist 
phenomenologists, and above all Pf&auml;nder, Scheler and Reinach, embraced 
wholeheartedly the project of working out in systematic fashion the entire 
pantheon of such theories and sub-theories, both formal and material. There 
are, first of all, the formal a priori disciplines of ontology and mathematics, 
including arithmetic, set theory, topology, mereology, the 'theory of objects' 
in Meinong's sense, and many others. We then have a priori disciplines dealing
with the three-dimensional world of space and time, and with the objects
of nature, including the overlapping disciplines of rational mechanics (Scheler
1913, p. 449n.), naive or qualitative physics (Hayes 1985, Smith and Casati
1994), kinaesiology, stereology, geometry, chronometry, and so on. We then
have the various sub-disciplines of aesthesiology (theories of secondary
qualities: cf. Witschel 1961): colourology, the a priori science of tones,
of feelings of warm and cold, textures and so on. There then follow logic
and the various disciplines associated with logic, including the theory of
evidence, apophantic logic, concept-theory, decision theory, the logic of
truth, and so on. Next come various sciences of 'rational psychology', sciences
of beliefs and desires, feelings, values and valuings, including Scheler's
material ethics and formal axiology and deontic logic, the a priori theories
of imperatives (Pf&auml;nder 1982), of norms, of will, a priori aesthetics,
the ontology of art and art works developed by Roman Ingarden, and so on.
We then have various a priori sciences pertaining to the domain of language
and expression (Holenstein 1975), universal and categorial grammars, the
a priori sciences of phonology, and the theory of speech acts or categorial
pragmatics developed by Reinach (1913; see also Mulligan (ed.), 1987) and
later by Austin and Searle. In the same work Reinach conceived the project
of a general a priori ontology of the entire domain of social interaction.
Sub-branches of the latter might include praxeology, the a priori science
of action, the a priori ontology of work, a priori economics, the a priori
theory of institutions, of law, a priori politics,<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a>
  </sup></font> <font size="+1">the phenomenology of intersubjectivity, the
a priori science of dialogue, a priori sociology, a priori geography, the
a priori theory of the life world, eidetic history, a priori anthropology,
and so on.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Of the non-formal disciplines on this list it is above 
all two whose principles and applications have been worked out in detail: 
the a priori theory of law worked out by Reinach in his "The A Priori Foundations 
of the Civil Law" of 1913 and the a priori science of economics worked out
by successive generations of so-called 'Austrian economists' from Menger to
Rothbard and beyond. Few in the tradition of Austrian economics have however
taken cognisance of the fact that, as Reinach puts it, the realm of the ontological
a priori is 'unsurveyably wide; whatever sorts of object we know, they all
have their "what", their "essence", and of all essentialities essential laws
hold.' (Reinach 1969)</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">On the standard praxeological account of economic science 
shared by Mises and Rothbard and succinctly stated in the latter's "In Defense
of 'Extreme Apriorism'" of 1957, there are held to be certain fundamental 
axioms of economics which are both true and such that their truth is grasped 
immediately. The theorems of economics are then established via logical deduction
from these axioms. There is in consequence no need for empirical testing
of these theorems, which is fortunate since, as Rothbard points out, empirical
testing is in any case impossible in the sciences of human action:</font>
 <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">It is physics that knows or can know its "facts" and can
test its conclusions against these facts, while being completely ignorant 
of its ultimate assumptions. In the sciences of human action, on the other 
hand, &#8230; [t]here is no laboratory where facts can be isolated and controlled; 
the "facts" of human history are complex ones, resultants of many causes. 
These causes can only be isolated by theory, theory that is necessarily a
priori to these historical (including statistical) facts. (1957, p. 315)</font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">The only way to <i>understand </i>human behaviour, Mises 
and Rothbard hold, is by means of a priori categories which we are able to
recognize in the complex and ever-changing warp and woof of history in virtue
of the fact that we are ourselves historical agents who are ready-armed with
an intimate knowledge of these categories through our own experience. In
a similar way we are able to recognize the presence of instantiations of
ethical categories in the warp and woof of history in virtue of the fact
that as a result of our own experience as ethical subjects we have an intimate
knowledge of ethical categories such as guilt, responsibility, obligation,
and so on.</font> 
  <p><font size="+1">Rothbard draws a distinction between two approaches
to the a priori as follows:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">Professor Mises, in the neo-Kantian tradition, considers 
[the law of human action] a <i>law of thought</i> and therefore a categorical 
truth <i>a priori</i> to all experience. My own epistemological position rests
on Aristotle and St. Thomas rather than Kant, and hence I would interpret 
the proposition differently. I would consider the axiom a <i>law of reality</i>
, rather than a law of thought (1957, p. 318).</font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">We are now in a position to understand what Rothbard means 
here by 'law of reality'. The definitive account of such laws is in fact to
be found neither in Rothbard nor in Aristotle and St. Thomas but rather precisely
in the writings of the Munich phenomenologists.</font> 
  <p><font size="+1">How is synthetic a priori knowledge possible? For the 
members of the Munich group, as also for Aristotle, Aquinas and Rothbard, 
there exists an <i>ontological</i> a priori, an a priori <i>in reality</i>
. The a priori status of judgments, propositions, beliefs or 'laws of thought' 
that is so central to the Kantian approach then proves to be derivative of
this more deep-lying a priori dimension on the side of the things themselves.</font>
 </p>
  <p><font size="+1">According to the Kantian conception, in contrast, science 
consists not so much in the attempt to construct a system of intrinsically 
intelligible assumptions, but rather in a 'coercion of nature' ('<i>N&ouml;tigung 
der Natur</i>') of such a sort that the latter comes to be formed in conformity 
with prior principles. Consider the following passage from Kant's first <i>
Critique:</i></font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">When Galileo caused balls, the weights of which he had 
himself previously determined, to roll down an inclined plane &#8230;, a light broke
upon all students of nature. They learned that reason has insight only into
that which it produces after a plan of its own, and that it must not allow
itself to be kept, as it were, in nature's leading-strings, but must itself
show the way with principles of judgment based upon fixed laws, coercing
nature to give answer to questions of reason's own determining. Accidental
observations, made in observance to no previously thought-out plan, can never
be made to yield a necessary law, which alone reason is concerned to discover.<sup><a href="#N_11_">

  </ul>
 <font size="+1">This passage expresses an important <i>epistemological</i>
 insight to the effect that scientists, if they seek systematic results in
the form of scientific laws, must undertake systematic observations guided
by relevant scientific assumptions. Kant and his followers have however drawn
  <i>ontological </i>questions from this insight. They claim in fact to have
shown that the object-domain which is in each case grasped by the scientist
must first have been pre-formed and pre-constituted in some peculiar ('transcendental')
fashion. This doctrine is then introduced by the Kantians into their explanation
of the peculiarity of a priori propositions: the latter are now held to acquire
their truth from the fact that we ourselves have in King-Midas-fashion imposed
them upon reality, have coerced reality to have it fit our prior prejudices.</font>
 
  <p><font size="+1">Now however we must ask:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">7. Is it really true that, as the Kantians assert, 
intrinsically plausible or intelligible pre-empirical synthetic propositions 
are in some sense imposed upon the world by cognizing subjects?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">That we have to answer 'no' to this question should be clear. 
Consider once again the example of the law of transitivity as this is applied 
to the parts of a stone or of a planet. This law would of course hold also 
in a world without thinking ('forming', 'constituting') subjects. It is thus
impossible to conceive it as something subjective (a mere 'law of thought').</font>
 
  <p><font size="+1">The thesis of the supposed subject-dependence of all
laws of this kind - as originally formulated by Kant - is moreover not capable 
of being harmonized with the fact that pre-empirical assumptions are sometimes 
contradicted through retrospective empirical control. For the assertion that
the given laws hold only because we have read them into the structure of
the world, that the empirical world of what happens and is the case is itself
a product of such reading in, surely excludes the possibility of conflict
between such laws and empirical happenings.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">The thesis that the world is 'transcendentally' formed 
leads further to the question why precisely <i>these</i> rather than <i>those</i>
 transcendental forms should be the ones through which the imposition of structure
is effected. Once again, the problem of arbitrariness seems here to raise
its ugly head. Many Kantians (and Popperians) are today content with an evolutionistic
treatment of this problem. In their eyes those pre-scientific assumptions
have come to dominate which enjoyed under the prevailing circumstances a
greater capacity for survival or a greater adaptability than the available 
alternatives. But the proponents of this doctrine appeal in this connection 
to the results of a science - biology - which itself presupposes very many 
pre-scientific assumptions of its own. This means that they are precluded 
from extending their account to at least one important group of pre-scientific 
assumptions, since the assertion that a science which itself presupposes certain
principles can itself serve to justify those principles contains an obvious
vicious circle. The striving for a fully adequate picture of reality thus
requires an answer to the question as to how pre-scientific assumptions arise
and are justified that goes much deeper than the answer of the evolutionists.
And as Husserl showed in the "Prolegomena" to his <i>Logical Investigations,
  </i>the same holds of every attempt to account for such assumptions through
appeals to an empirical science.</font> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">Our realistic conception of the empirical sciences tells 
us, however, how we are to formulate an answer of the required sort. The striving
on the part of scientists for intelligible assumptions can be justified by
appeal to the fact that the world itself possesses certain intelligible structures
- structures of the sort which are captured for example in the laws of mereology
or colourology. The world itself is in many of its traits in itself intelligible.</font>
 </p>
  <p><font size="+1">The general idea is well conveyed by the Munich phenomenologists, 
for example by Scheler in his great critique of formalism (and in particular 
of Kantianism) in ethics (1913/16). Scheler is there concerned to establish 
the basis of an ethical theory which is 'a priori' in the sense that, as he
puts it, 'its propositions are evident and can neither be tested by something
that has been found, prior to such testing, by observation and induction
nor be refuted by observation and induction' (translation, pp. 47f.) Our
knowledge of such a priori propositions is gained by means of what Scheler
calls an 'intuition of essences' of the sort that is involved, for example,
when we grasp the colour <i>red</i> and grasp that it is different from <i>
green</i> or<i> blue, </i>or when we grasp the essential interconnection between
  <i>red</i> and <i>visual extension</i>. We do not have to observe and check
and carry out inductions in order to grasp that red is different from green,
or that jealousy is different from greed.</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">Whenever we have such essences and such interconnections 
among them (which can be of different kinds, e.g., reciprocal, unilateral, 
conflicting, or, as in the case of values, ordered as higher and lower), the
    <i>truth</i> of propositions that find their fulfillment in such essences 
is <i>totally</i> independent of the entire sphere of observation and description, 
as well as of what is established in inductive experience. &#8230; Hence the a
priori is <i>not</i> dependent on <i>propositions</i> (or even on <i>acts</i>
 of judgment corresponding to them). It is not dependent, for example, on 
the <i>form</i> of such propositions and acts (i.e., on "forms of judgments," 
from which Kant developed his "categories" as "functional laws" of "thinking"). 
On the contrary, the a priori belongs wholly to the "<i>given</i>" and the
sphere of <i>facts</i>. A proposition is only a priori true (or false) insofar
as it finds its fulfillment in <i>such </i>"facts". (Scheler 1913/16, p.
448, translation, p. 49)</font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">A priori knowledge thus rests on experience, since</font>
 <font size="+1">everything and anything that is given rests on "experience."
He who wishes to call this "empiricism" may do so.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a>
  </sup></font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 
  <ul>
    <font size="+1">&#8230; It therefore is not experience and non-experience, or
so-called presuppositions of <i>all </i>possible experience (which would be
unexperienceable in every respect), with which we are concerned in the contrast
between the a priori and a posteriori; rather, we are concerned with two
    <i>kinds</i> of experience (translation, p. 52):</font>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">On the one hand is immediate intuitive experience of essences 
such as colours and shapes and their interrelations<b>, </b>and on the other
hand is <i>observational</i> experience of what happens and is the case.
Now however we have to consider the question:</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; 
  <ul>
    <i><font size="+1">8. Might the intrinsically plausible pre-empirical 
synthetic propositions all be false?</font></i>
  </ul>
 <font size="+1">Certainly it might be that in the course of scientific development 
pre-empirical assumptions arise which correspond to no structures in the world
and have only a somehow purely pragmatic value. From the realistic standpoint,
however, the proportion of true pre-empirical assumptions must be considerable
in every phase of this development. For the doctrine of scientific realism
asserts not only that the world exists, but also that it corresponds broadly
to the ideas we have about it. What the view presented here adds to this
doctrine of scientific realism (which is, the reader will remember, here
presupposed without argument), is the result that the true picture of reality
broad strands of which are already in our possession must consist not only
of accidentally true propositions which picture the accidents of reality,
but also of true, necessary and contentful propositions which picture certain
  <i>intelligible</i> <i>structures.</i></font> 
  <p><font size="+1">Such propositions can also be called 'a priori'. Note 
again, however, that the conception of the a priori that is then yielded turns
out to be a non-Kantian conception. It claims that, where Kant wanted always
to have the a priori viewed as something subjective, something pertaining 
purely to knowledge, there is in fact such a thing as an a priori in the world.</font>
 </p>
  <p><font size="+1">We affirm simply that there are synthetic intrinsically 
plausible true propositions, and that science strives to accumulate ever more
of these; we do not however affirm that we know (or much less that we have
certain knowledge about) which of the available candidates for such propositions
are true among those which at any given time play a role in the really existing
sciences. The given intelligible structural traits of reality can be overlooked
or misinterpreted. The recognition that there are a priori structural traits
in the world yields, to repeat, no easy sort of indubitable evidence in relation
to the corresponding propositions. This fallibilistic doctrine of a priori
laws of reality does however yield a nice solution to one age-old problem
facing all defenders of the a priori. How, as Caldwell puts it (1984), does
one choose between rival systems all of which claim to rest on a priori foundations?
On the non-fallibilistic conception it is difficult to make sense even of
the possibility of rival systems of this sort. On the conception here defended,
in contrast, the existence of such rival systems can be seen to be a perfectly
natural and acceptable consequence of the just-mentioned difficulties we
will often fact in coming to know even the intelligible traits of reality.
One adjudicates between such systems in the same way, then, in which one
adjudicates between all rival scientific hypotheses, namely via a complex
mixture of empirical <i>and</i> a priori considerations.</font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Conclusion</font></b> </p>
  <p><font size="+1">We can summarize the main argument of this paper as
follows:</font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><i>Do the empirical theories with the help of which we seek to approximate 
a good or true picture of reality rest on any non-empirical presuppositions?</i>
 </p>
  <p>Yes: Extreme empiricists </p>
  <p>No: <i>Are the propositions which express these</i> <i>pre-empirical 
assumptions in every case analytic (tautological, lacking in content)?</i>
 </p>
  <p>Yes: Logical positivists <br>
No: <i>Do we have an infallible knowledge of all the synthetic pre-empirical 
propositions which are presupposed by the various sciences in the different 
phases of their development?</i> </p>
  <p>Yes: Extreme Cartesians <br>
No: <i>Could these assumptions, which are presupposed by the empirical sciences,
be arbitrary?</i> </p>
  <p>Yes: Feyerabend <br>
No: <i>The propositions in question must therefore be characterized by a
certain plausibility. Is this plausibility always a contextual affair?</i>
 </p>
  <p>Yes: Hermeneutic relativists <br>
No: <i>There is therefore something like an intrinsic plausibility. Are the
intrinsically plausible pre-empirical synthetic propositions which play an
indispensable role in the sciences given only individually, so that we have
only a few isolated examples thereof between which no systematic relations
would obtain?</i> </p>
  <p>Yes: Ad hoc Kantianism <br>
No: <i>Is it really true, as the Kantians assert, that the intrinsically plausible
or intelligible pre-empirical synthetic propositions here at issue are read
into or imposed upon the world by us?</i> </p>
  <p>Yes: systematic Kantianism <br>
No: <i>Might the intrinsically plausible pre-empirical synthetic propositions 
all be false?</i> </p>
  <p>Yes: Epistemology Nihilism <br>
No: <i>Certain pre-empirical synthetic intrinsically plausible propositions 
thus require ontological correlates which are their truth-makers: there are
intelligible structures in the world, which we could also call 'a priori structures'</i>
