{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Johannes Daubert.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 It is only relatively recently that philosophers, both within and without the phenomenological tradition, have once more begun \softline
to read, and understand, Husserl\'92s }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Logical Investigations.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Already in 1902}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 , }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 however, the crucial importance of this work was \softline
recognized by Johannes Daubert, then a student of the philosopher and psychologist Theodor Lipps in Munich. Daubert  \softline
contributed more than anyone else to making known the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Logical Investigations}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  not only in Munich but also in the wider world \softline
beyond, and he has strong claims to be regarded as the true architect of  the phenomenological movement.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Johannes Daubert (1877-1947) was a  member of the Munich phenomenological circle which included also Max \softline
Scheler, Alexander Pf\'e4nder, Moritz Geiber, Adolf Reinach and Edith Stein. Not a single line of Daubert\'92s work was published \softline
during his lifetime, and only recently has it become  possible for the  wider philosophical community to become acquainted \softline
with Daubert\'92s work as a result of the heroic efforts of Karl Schuhmann, and subsequently of Elisabeth Schuhmann, in \softline
transcribing papers from his }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Nachlass.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Daubert's influence made itself felt not through his writings but through lectures and \softline
discussions extending over several  years. These discussions were a major factor in the establishment of phenomenology in both  \softline
Munich and G\'f6ttingen.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  But discontinuities in the phenomenological  tradition caused by two World Wars hampered the  \softline
handing down of Daubert's teachings, which had already reached the  high point of their influence in the first decade of the \softline
century. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20      Still more important is the fact that Daubert, who volunteered  for the army in 1914, withdrew after the war to a farm he \softline
had bought  for himself outside Munich. This spelled, for the time being at least,  the end of his active philosophising. He lost \softline
contact with the new  generation of students that was establishing itself in Munich, though  he always remained in touch with \softline
Alexander Pf\'e4nder, the then leading  spokesman of Munich phenomenology. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Daubert remained a leading figure in the Munich circle until the outbreak of World War 1. [On Daubert and Munich \softline
phenomenology in general see Spiegeiberg 1982, 169f. On Daubert's life see Schuhmann 1985, and Schuhmann and Smith \softline
1985.]\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \ul0 \tab Daubert kept his manuscripts at his farm to the very end of his  life. They were transferred in 1967 to the Bavarian \softline
State Library in  Munich, where they were classified under the sigil `Daubertiana'.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Because of the highly unusual system of \softline
shorthand which Daubert had used  throughout, it was not until 1976 that these manuscripts became accessible, after Karl \softline
Schuhmann managed to break the code.\par

}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Speech Act and Sachverhalt}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 The enthusiastic support which was lent by Daubert to the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Logical Investigations }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 and to the frame of thought embodied in it \softline
did not however prevent him from criticizing Husserl whenever he found the latter's views to be inadequate, and two major \softline
issues on which Daubert diverged from the standpoint of the master were in regard to the idealism-realism problem and and \softline
in regard to the treatment of speech acts (commands, wishes, questions and other performative uses of language).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Husserl himself, like most philosophers of his day, had treated such phenomena as derivative, assigning them to a level \softline
where they would depend upon a more fundamental layer of objectifying acts, which is to say acts of representation, directed \softline
towards objects, and acts of judgment, directed towards }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Sachverhalt\~}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 or states of affairs.  Daubert maintained against Husserl \softline
that speech acts such as questioning and commanding call for special non-objectifying acts which would serve to determinate \softline
their meanings in just the same direct way that the intentional directedness of objectifying acts determinings the meanings of \softline
associated nominal expressions and declarative sentences. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Husserl saw expressed commands and wishes as disguised versions of declarative sentences (It is my command that \softline
..., it is my wish that ...). Daubert, in contrast, maintained, that they are phenomena collateral with statements or assertions. \softline
This however meant giving up the Husserlian thesis according to which meaning is just the "manner of being directed to all \softline
object."\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Daubert accordingly developed a detailed phenomenology of the question which distinguished 1. the mental act of \softline
questioning (}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 das Fragen}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 ), 2. the question itself, as logical formation (}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 die Frage}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 )}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 , }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 and 3. the question as addressed to someone, \softline
the directed question }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 (die Anfrage). }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 1. is analogous to the judgment, 2. to the proposition as ideal meaning-formation, 3. to the \softline
speech act of assertion. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Both judging and questioning acts are correlated with }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Sacbverhalte }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 or }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 states of aftairs. }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Such states of affairs do not, in \softline
Daubert\'92s eyes, belong to a special realm, separate from or transcendent to the realm of things. For just as, according to \softline
Daubert, the judging act is founded on perceptions, so the target}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20  }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 of such an act, the state of affairs, is founded on the things \softline
perceived: it is as it were a certain special or segment of reality, the result of a demarcation which we execute by means of our \softline
judgment.}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \ul0 \tab But Daubert goes further still and distinguishes between how things stand }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 in themselves }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 and how they are asserted \softline
to be in our judgments. Thus he distinguishes terminology between the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Sachverhalt }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 on the one hand and what he calls the \softline
}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 "Erkenntnisverhalt," }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 on the other: the "state of affairs as cognized", the state of affairs as it is"unfolded" in cognition (17v). 
The former is the objectively existing structure of things, properties and relations is they are in and of themselves. The latter \softline
is that side or aspect it the former which serves as the immediate objectual correlate of a given concrete act of judging, the \softline
medium through which the relevant things and properties are given to or delineated by the judging subject.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  That element which serves as focus for the judgment accordingly exists in the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Erkenntnisverhalt }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 as something thrown into \softline
relief in relation to the other members. Thus consider: The chairman opens the meeting, The chairman is opening the meeting, \softline
The meeting is being opened by the chairman, The opening of the meeting is being conducted by the chairman, The chairman \softline
has opened the meeting, The meeting has been opened by the chairman. Each of these sentences differs as to its associated \softline
}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Erkenntnisverhalt}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 , but they are in fact concerned with one and the same objective Sachverhalt.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Analogous differences offer themselves now if one considers the relation between this same objective state of affairs \softline
and the objectual correlates of corresponding wishes, commands, presumptions, and so on:\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Has the chairman opened the meeting? If only the chairman would open the meeting. The chairman should open the meeting. \softline
The chairman is allowed to open the meeting, etc. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Daubert now proposes that we recognize, in addition to the }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Sachverhalt }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 and }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Erkenntnisverhalt}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \~also a }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 sui generis \softline
Frageverhalt \'96 }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 the state of affairs as questioned --}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 , }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 which would serve as the ontological correlate of the questio, and also a \softline
}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Wunschverhalt}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  \'96 the state of affairs as wished \'96 }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 as the ontological correlate of the wish, and so on.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 [See Smith 1987 for a discussion of this matter from the point of view of the work on states of affairs of Daubert's fellow \softline
Munich phenomenologist Adolf Reinach.] }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  That which directly corresponds to the question is not any full-fledged objective state of affairs, replete in all its manifold \softline
determinations: otherwise it would be pointless to ask the question at all. Rather the immediate objectual correlate of a question \softline
is, as Daubert puts it, a certain opening up on the side of the objects. The state of affairs as questioned is still in some respects \softline
"open." It has, in Roman Ingarden\'92s terminology, certain loci of indeterminacy, and in questioning we aim to close this \softline
opening, to establish a structure that would be in relevant respects more fully determinate.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Daubert's concern with the meanings of performatives is important because it triggered a series of investigations of the topic \softline
of non-objectifying acts by other members of the Munich circle, eventually culminating in the detailed and comprehensive \softline
theory of the act of promising which was published by Adolf Reinach in the first volume of Husserl's }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Jahrbuch f\'fcr Philosophie \softline
und ph\'e4nomenologische Forschung }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 (and to see the importance of the Munich school in the early development of \softline
phenomenology it is useful to note that of the five initial members of the editorial board, four\~\'96 namely Reinach, Pf\'e4nder, \softline
Geiger, and Scheler \'96 which is to say all but Husserl \'96 hailed from Munich).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 The Idealism-Realism Problem\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Daubert continued to follow developments in phenomenology well into the 1930s, and his manuscripts contain material }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 inter \softline
alia }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 on Husserl\'92s }{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 Ideas}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 , on Heidegger's }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 Being and Time}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 , on Ingarden's "Bemerkungen  zum Problem Idealismus-Realismus" \softline
(published in the Husserl-Festschrift of 1929), and on Aron Gurwitsch's "Ph\'e4nomenologie  der Thematik und des reinen Ich". \softline
What all these works have in common, of course, is  their opposition to Husserl's idealism, an opposition which Daubert shared, \softline
and which played a central role in his philosophical thinking.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Daubert\'92s focus is the subject's cognitive relation to the world,  mainly to the world of nature. How can reality be given \softline
in and to  consciousness? How does the identical thing present itself in or  through a multiplicity of phenomena? How is true \softline
and evident cognition  of "things out there" possible at all? In answering these questions, Daubert develops an original al\-ter\-na\-
tive to the Husserlian  conception of the relation between }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 consciousness}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 , which for Husserl is  notoriously taken as something \softline
absolute, and }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 reality}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 , which was  Daubert's own point of departure. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20      Perception is normally seen as providing the fundamental layer in  our experience of objects. A phenomenology of \softline
perception is therefore  basic to all further reflection on the relation between consciousness  and world.  As Daubert puts it: \softline
\'91Precisely that which I perceive and which is given to me by way of  perception is real and has its place in reality; it has its \softline
chemical  structure, it burns, etc. There is nothing behind it.\'92 (ms A I 3, 143r) Daubert can thus be considered a direct realist \softline
in his theory of perception, in the manner of the psychologist J. J. Gibson. It is not sense data which are the objects of \softline
perception, but rather the real things themselves. Certainly we may suffer perceptual  illusion and error,  but any  attempt to \softline
understand such phenomena will itself have to build firmly on the  basis of a theory of the one, omnipresent world that is given \softline
in perception. All occurrences belonging to  subjective experience are entangled with  this world. If I see a tree, then it  pertains \softline
to this very experience that the tree I perceive may catch  fire, that it may be blown down in a storm, my experience is thus \softline
rooted in the  surrounding reality in a whole variety of ways.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Indeed for Daubert consciousness itself exists only when and insofar as it is involved in this  reality. In remarks which \softline
recall Hume (and which are subsequently echoed in the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre), Daubert holds that one cannot ascribe \softline
to consciousness any existence of its own,  independent of this embranglement, this immediate connection, with the natural \softline
world.  Daubert thus rejects the notion of a special `ego-substance': }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 consciousness cannot be  grasped in terms of this \softline
conception, because it is nothing in front of  us, nothing which can serve as target of an act, and, with this, nothing  substantial. \softline
Indeed Daubert wants to insist that `that in which  reality shows itself is nothing existing by itself, but only a  }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 function directed 
towards reality}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 ' (}{\plain \fs20 \i\fs20 ibid., }{\plain \fs20 \fs20 62v).}{\plain \fs20 \super\fs20 15}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  And further \'91Consciousness is not a being in itself but rather something which  functions only \softline
in something else [}{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 was nur in Anderes funktioniert}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 ] and  in which something else functions in its turn [}{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 und in welches hinein  \softline
Anderes funktioniert}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 ]. The functioning being of consciousness has no  special existence of its own and is nothing real\'92 (11v).\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab Daubert compares consciousness \'96 which exists only in its functioning \'96 with syncategorematic terms such as \'91and\'92 \softline
(and to Husserl's treatment in the fourth  Logical Investigation of the problem of how to understand such terms when they are \softline
torn from their contexts).}{\plain \fs20 \super\fs20  }{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Husserl had said that  when we believe ourselves to understand syncategoremata as such, i.e.  taken \softline
in isolation, then this can only be because a completion of  their signification has occurred and an }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 anomalous signification}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  has  \softline
thereby been indirectly awarded to them. Thus an isolated `and', for  example, is understood by means of a tacit reference to \softline
an idea of the  type `A and B'. Daubert's treatment of consciousness is, now, an extension of this same idea. The term \softline
`consciousness' cannot be understood  except via a supplementation of its meaning. The term is a relative  noun, reflecting the \softline
fact that consciousness is always consciousness  }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 of,}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  and its use as a categorematic substantive is thus misleading as to the nature \softline
of that to which it refers.\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20      Consciousness functions in a }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 normal}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  way only when it `hits' an  object. This thesis carries for Daubert the implication that  \softline
consciousness may acquire a status of its own, may come to be  substantivised as an `ego', only by becoming deprived of this \softline
normal or proper function. In imaginative or hypothetical thinking, when consciousness goes on holiday, it  seems to  withdraw \softline
from contact with reality and thus to acquire a pseudo-being of its own. But in Daubert's view the entanglement with  reality \softline
is still preserved, though veiled and hidden, even in these  modifications, and he holds that the direct awareness of reality is \softline
at work even in  the phenomenological epoch\'e9 itself. \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab All of this has implications, now, for the doctrine of idealism. For if consciousness is of necessity always emtangled \softline
with reality, then without this reality no cognition would be possible at all. The issue of  idealism is in Daubert\'92s eyes to be \softline
decided only by taking careful account of normal  experience, which involves our functioning in some way towards an  object. \softline
And to skip over the objective term  involved in the problem  is not to solve but to avoid it. \'91If for fundamental reasons the real \softline
object remains outside  consciousness, Husserl's idealism will eventually retain its right, or  rather, it will become plausible, \softline
for there will be no argument left  for the realist case\'92 (16v). \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \tab According to Husserl in }{\plain \fs20 \ul\fs20 Ideas}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  I, it is essential to an act of consciousness that it  have an ego-pole, that it be an act of \softline
a phenomenological subject. It  is not, however, essential - not even for an act that is experienced as  an act of perception - that \softline
it have any real, transcendent  object. By this means the pure ego acquires the status of an  absolute substance, reality that of \softline
a mere dependent accident.}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  Husserl's awarding a merely relative status to the world of objects is thereby, as he himself  admits, \softline
a reversal of `the sense usually expressed in speaking of what  is' (93). Daubert insists, however, that the meanings of terms \softline
like `reality' and  `existence' become established in everyday language prior to any  philosophising. It cannot be the task of \softline
phenomenology to  overthrow this sense, but only to elucidate it: phenomenology must be  `inner clarification of the given' not \softline
criticism in the sense of  `theory from above' (16v). Husserl nonetheless insists upon just such a `reversal of sense': \softline
consciousness as he conceives it never in fact  reaches out to real reality. It is directed instead toward a pseudo-reality \softline
constituted by consciousness to its own specifications: `all being is either pure consciousness or a being  constituted by pure \softline
consciousness', a phrase which for Daubert contains an internal contradiction (92v). \par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 \par
}{\plain \fs20 \b\fs20 Influence\par
}{\plain \fs20 \fs20 Daubert\'92s ideas on judgment and question, on states of affairs were influential, above all through Reinach, who served as the \softline
most important teacher and expositor of Husserlian ideas among the early phenomenologists. His later views on realism and \softline
idealism have obvious echoes in the work of Ingarden, and, while the realist tradition of phenomenology has, for historical \softline
reasons, failed to achieve the dominant position of \'91transcendental idealist\'92 doctrines inspire by Husserl and the later \softline
phenomenologists, Daubert\'92s work is of importance nonetheless and its transcription by the Schuhmanns can be expected to \softline
reveal original contributions of}{\plain \fs20 \fs20  a significance that is not merely historical. \par
