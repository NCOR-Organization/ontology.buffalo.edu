	<span class="auto-style3">Introduction</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Of Chisholm's many signal contributions to analytic metaphysics, perhaps
the most important is his treatment of boundaries, a category of entity
that has been neglected, to say the least, in the history of ontology.
We can gain some preliminary idea of the sorts of problems which the Chisholmian
ontology of boundaries is designed to solve, if we consider the following
Zeno-inspired thought-experiment.
</span>
<p><span class="auto-style1">We are to imagine ourselves proceeding along a line through the middle
of a disk that is divided into two precisely symmetrical segments, one
of which is red, the other green, and that we move continuously from the
red to the green segment. What happens as we pass the boundary between
the two? Do we pass through a last point </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> that is red
and a first point </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> that is green? Clearly not, given
the density of every continuum; for then we should have to admit an indefinite
number of further points between </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> and 
</span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">
which would somehow have no color. To acknowledge the existence of just
one of </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> and 
</span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> but not the other,
however, as is dictated by the standard mathematical treatment of the continuum,
would be to countenance a peculiar privileging of one of the two segments
over the other, and such an unmotivated asymmetry can surely be rejected
as a contravention of the principle of sufficient reason.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Perhaps, then, the line on which we move is colorless at the point where
it crosses from one segment into the other. The two segments would then
be analogous to open intervals in the set-theoretic sense. One might seek
support for this idea by reflecting that points and lines are not in any
case the sorts of things which can be colored, since color properly applies
only to extended regions and not to the unextended boundaries thereof.
Imagine, however, a perfectly homogeneous red surface. Is a point or a
line within the interior of this surface not then also red? In the end,
however, it does not much matter how we answer this question, since an
argument exactly analogous to the one here presented can be formulated
also in relation to a range of other sorts of cases (indeed to qualities
in general), including cases of qualities for which it is not attractive
to suppose that extendedness in space is a precondition of existence.
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Thus the argument can be applied to purely temporal phenomena, such
as the beginnings and endings of mental processes. In the work of Zeno
and of Bolzano it has been applied to the phenomena of motion and bodily
contact. Imagine a body which is for a certain period at rest and then
begins to move. Is there a last point in time </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> when
the body is at rest and a first point </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> when it is in
motion? Clearly not, given the density of every continuum; for then we
should have to admit an indefinite number of further points between </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">
and </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> at which the body would somehow be neither at
rest nor in motion. To acknowledge one of </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> and 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">
but not the other would again be to countenance a peculiar privileging
of one of the two temporal segments over the other. Perhaps, then, the
body is neither in motion nor at rest at the point in time where it crosses
the segmentary divide, so that the two temporal intervals would be analogous,
once again, to open regions. But is it even coherent to suppose that a
body might be neither in motion nor at rest at a certain point in time?
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Imagine, to pursue an example from Bolzano, two perfect spheres at rest
and in contact with each other. What happens at the point where they touch?
Is there a last point </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> that belongs to the first sphere
and a first point </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> that belongs to the second? Again:
clearly not, for then we should have to admit an indefinite number of further
points between </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> and 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> and this would
imply that the two spheres were not in contact after all. To acknowledge
one of </span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">1</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> and 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">p</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">2</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> but not the other
would be to countenance an asymmetry of a quite peculiarly unmotivated
sort. And our third alternative seems here to be ruled out also. For to
admit that the point where the two spheres touch belongs to neither of
the two spheres seems to amount to the thesis that the two spheres do not
touch at all.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">The Brentano-Chisholm Theory of the Continuum</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">What, then, is to be done? As Chisholm has insisted, there is in fact
an alternative account of the actual reality, as far as color is concerned,
at the point on the line where the red and green segments meet, an account
which can be smoothly and uniformly extended to the other cases mentioned.
This affirms that there is but one (albeit complex) point of the line which
lies precisely on the border between the two segments. This point is colored,
but not in simple fashion, for it is in a certain sense </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">both red and
green.</span><span class="auto-style1"> To put the matter in another way: it is at one and the same
time a</span><span class="auto-style2"> ceasing to be red</span><span class="auto-style1"> and a 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">beginning to be green</span><span class="auto-style1">. And
in yet another way still: it is a point where a red point and a green point
	</span><span class="auto-style2">coincide.</span><span class="auto-style1">
Similarly in the case of the particle that begins to move: here too there
is a single point at which the body is </span><span class="auto-style2">both at rest and moving</span><span class="auto-style1"> (or
more precisely: it is at one and the same time </span><span class="auto-style2">ceasing to be at rest</span><span class="auto-style1">
and </span><span class="auto-style2">beginning to move)</span><span class="auto-style1">. The terminal boundary of the initial interval
coincides with the initial boundary of the subsequent interval. And the
same account can be given also of what occurs when two perfect spheres
touch: a point on the boundary of the one sphere coincideswith a point
on the boundary of the adjacent sphere. All bodies and all temporal intervals
are on this account analogous to closed regions - or perhaps we should
more properly say that there is no analogue in the world of spatial and
temporal continua of the standard opposition between open and closed.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">It is the theory of coincidence, and the account of boundaries and the
continuum which this dictates, which will occupy us in what follows. We
shall concentrate especially on four papers in which Chisholm treats the
theory of coincidence of boundaries in space (1983, 1989, 1992/93 and 1994).
As will already be clear, analogous reasoning can be applied also to the
coincidence of boundaries in time (to beginnings and endings, for example:
see Chisholm 1982, 1992), though we shall here leave these, temporal, matters
out of account.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_2_"><span class="auto-style1">(2)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Chisholm's theory of coincidence is drawn from the work on space, time
and the continuum of Franz Brentano and above all from Brentano's idea
that what is above all characteristic of a continuum is 'the possibility
of a coincidence of boundaries'. (Brentano 1988, pp. 4f.) Brentano's thesis
runs: if something continuous is a mere boundary then it can never exist
except in connection with other boundaries and except as belonging to a
continuum of higher dimension. This must be said of all boundaries, including
those which possess no dimension at all such as spatial points and moments
of time and movement: a cutting free from everything that is continuous
and extended is for them, too, absolutely impossible. Brentano's ideas
are based in turn on the conception of boundaries and continua sketched
by Aristotle in the </span><span class="auto-style2">Physics</span><span class="auto-style1">. As Brentano developed and elaborated
Aristotle's sketchy remarks, so Chisholm sought to render Brentano's ideas
in a formal manner, and to incorporate them into a general theory of kinds
or categories of being. I shall attempt here to extend and to complete
Chisholm's formalizations and to show how much further works need to be
done. But I shall seek also to demonstrate that he has in a sense domesticated
Brentano's ideas by dissociating them from a number of difficult and puzzling
consequences which a more detailed analysis will show to be bound up inextricably
with the notion of coincidence.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Set Theory</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">It is above all the predominance of set theory as an instrument of
(or more precisely as a substitute for) ontological investigation that
has dictated the neglect of the category of boundary on the part of those
working in the field of analytic metaphysics.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_3_"><span class="auto-style1">(3)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Indeed already in the early years of this century Brentano had seen
the need to criticize standard set-theoretic writings on the continuum
where, as he points out, the idea of coincidence 'will be sought after
entirely in vain'. (Brentano 1988, p. 5)
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">From the point of view of set theory, boundaries are logical constructions,
or in other words talk of boundaries is seen as a mere </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">façon
de parler</span><span class="auto-style1"> about other things (effectively limits of sequences, or other
like abstracta). Such treatments are of unquestioned value for mathematical
purposes, and we must stress that we are not here attempting an alternative
foundation of the mathematics of the continuum of the sort which Lesniewski
projected. Rather, we are concerned with boundary-continuum structures
as these make themselves manifest concretely, in bodies, or in what Chisholm
calls 'spatial individuals'. The set-theoretic account of the continuum
proves to be inadequate as an account of such concrete continua for at
least the following reasons.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">1. The latter are </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">qualitative</span><span class="auto-style1"> structures. This is so not merely
in the sense that they are (standardly) filled by qualities (of color,
temperature, hardness, etc.), but also in the sense that standard mathematical
oppositions, for example between countable and uncountable magnitudes or
between dense and continuous series, seem here to gain no purchase. Nothing
like Cantor's continuum problem arises for the concrete continuum, and
indeed the very existence of this problem testifies to a certain weakness
in the set-theoretic approach to the problems at issue.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">2. The set-theoretical construction of the continuum is predicated on
the highly questionable thesis that out of unextended building blocks an
extended whole can somehow be constructed. Yet however many entities of
zero dimension are assembled together, it seems difficult to comprehend
that a whole of higher dimension will somehow be formed.
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">3. The application of set theory to a subject-matter presupposes quite
generally the isolation of some basic level of </span><span class="auto-style2">Urelemente</span><span class="auto-style1"> in such
a way as to make possible a simulation of the structures appearing on higher
levels by means of sets of successively higher types. In the world of concrete
continua, in contrast, there need be no relevant </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">Urelemente</span><span class="auto-style1"> which
could serve as such a starting point of ontological construction. It is
however unproblematic that concrete continua are organized in such a way
that parts, including boundary-parts, are capable of being discriminated
within them.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">4. Set theory sees the continuum as homogeneous, as made up of only
one sort of ultimate part (according to preference: the empty set, points,
atoms, or real numbers). Concrete continua are in contrast made up of different
sorts of parts; above all, they are made up of boundaries of different
numbers of dimensions, on the one hand, and of extended bodies or regions
which these boundaries are the boundaries of, on the other.
</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Mereology</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">As an alternative to set theory, Chisholm adopts as his framework for
dealing with the kinds or categories of individual beings the theory of
part and whole or </span><span class="auto-style2">mereology</span>:<sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_4_"><span class="auto-style1">(4)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1"> boundaries
are </span><span class="auto-style2">parts</span><span class="auto-style1"> of the things they bound. Mereology has the advantage
that we can use it to study the ontological structures in a given domain
even in the absence of any ultimate knowledge as to the atoms, if any,
out of which the domain is constructed. For the axioms of mereology apply
whether the world is an infinitely divisible fluid or an edifice constructed
out of atoms - or indeed some combination of the two of the sort that is
exemplified, for example, by Descartes' bicategorial ontology of </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">res
extensa</span><span class="auto-style1"> and </span><span class="auto-style2">res cogitans</span><span class="auto-style1">.
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Boundaries of bodies are actual parts of the bodies which they bound.
But they are not just any sort of part; rather they are parts which, as
a matter of necessity, can exist only as proper parts of things of higher
dimension which they are the boundaries of (where from the set-theoretic
point of view, isolated extensionless points are presented as existing
in complete independence of any larger wholes).
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Boundaries cannot exist in isolation: there are, in reality, no isolated
points, lines or surfaces. As Brentano himself would express it, our healthy
common sense, which is here evidence itself, would raise its head in violent
protest at the postulation of such entities.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_5_"><span class="auto-style1">(5)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Boundaries are in this respect comparable to universal forms or structures
(for example the structure of a molecule as this is realized in a given
concrete instance), as also to shadows and holes.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_6_"><span class="auto-style1">(6)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Entities in all of these categories are such that, while they require
of necessity hosts which instantiate them, they can be instantiated by
an indefinite variety of different hosts.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_7_"><span class="auto-style1">(7)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Consider, for example, the surface of an apple. The whole apple can
here serve as instantiating host, but so also can the apple minus core,
which might have been eaten away to varying degrees from within.
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">In light of some of Chisholm's remarks on the nature of souls or minds,</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_8_"><span class="auto-style1">(8)
	</span>
</a></sup><span class="auto-style1">we
might point out that souls or minds, too, may have similar features. If
there are souls, and if souls are hosted by bodies, then the same soul
can be hosted by many bodies in the sense that a body may lose molecules,
cells and even limbs and yet preserve its relation to the same identical
soul. The soul might even </span><span class="auto-style2">be</span><span class="auto-style1"> a boundary. (This would be the case,
for example - though it seems that an option along these lines is not what
Chisholm has in mind - if the soul's (or mind's) activity were essentially
a matter of what happens where nerve-endings are in multivariously patterned
contact with each other inside the brain.)</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_9_"><span class="auto-style1">(9)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">All the mentioned types of entities share further the fact that they
license certain sorts of ontological inference (</span><span class="auto-style2">if</span><span class="auto-style1"> there is a boundary/structure/hole/soul
having these and those properties, </span><span class="auto-style2">then</span><span class="auto-style1"> there is a host having these
and those properties). We cannot infer to any specific host, however. Thus
it cannot be said of any definite continuum that a boundary is dependent
on </span><span class="auto-style2">it</span><span class="auto-style1">: that which a boundary is dependent on can be designated rather
only via a general term: what is required by a boundary is, Brentano says,
'not this or that particular continuum, but any continuum of the appropriate
kind.'</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_10_"><span class="auto-style1">(10)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">For while no boundary can exist without being connected with a continuum,
	</span>
<font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">'</span></font><span class="auto-style1">there
is no specifiable part, however small, of the continuum, and no point,
however near it may be to the boundary, which is such that we may say that
it is the existence of </span><span class="auto-style2">that</span><span class="auto-style1"> part or of 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">that</span><span class="auto-style1"> point which conditions
the boundary.' (Brentano 1981, p. 56)
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Plerosis</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">As will by now be clear, boundaries can be classified as 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">external</span><span class="auto-style1">,
for example a point on the surface of a sphere, and </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">internal</span><span class="auto-style1">, for
example a point or line or surface entirely within the interior of a sphere.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_11_"><span class="auto-style1">(11)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">In contrast to standard set-theoretic treatments, the Brentano-Chisholm
theory is now able to do justice to the fact that the boundaries given
in experience are in many cases </span><span class="auto-style2">asymmetrical 
	</span><span class="auto-style1">(so that we</span><span class="auto-style2">
	</span><span class="auto-style1">might
in certain circumstances talk of </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">'</span></font><span class="auto-style1">oriented boundaries').
This applies, for example, to the external boundaries of bodies and to
the beginnings and endings of processes extended in time. Intuitively it
seems not to be the case that the external boundary of a substance is in
the same sense a boundary of the complement entity (i.e. of the entity
which results when we imagine this substance as having been subtracted
from the universe as a whole). (Even the thesis that there is such an entity
is something which, from our present perspective, has to be taken with
a pinch of salt.)
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Boundaries, accordingly, may be boundaries only in certain directions
and not in others. Imagine a line that is tangent to a circle, and meets
the circle at a certain point. Strictly speaking we need here to recognize
two points, a point on the line and a point on the circle, which </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">coincide</span><span class="auto-style1">,
the one with the other. The two points are not identical since they serve
as boundaries in different directions. The point on the line is a boundary
in two rectilinear directions, the point on the circle is a boundary in
two directions of a certain determinate curvature.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_12_"><span class="auto-style1">(12)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Every point, every line, every surface, must serve as a boundary in
at least one direction. A point within the interior of a solid sphere is
a boundary in all possible directions. The analogous point on the plane
surface of a solid hemisphere is, in contrast, a boundary in exactly half
this maximal number of directions. Brentano introduces at this point the
notion of the </span><span class="auto-style2">plerosis</span><span class="auto-style1"> or 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">'</span></font><span class="auto-style1">fullness'
of a boundary. The mentioned interior boundary has full plerosis, the external
hemispherical boundary has only half plerosis. Imagine that we have two
cubes designed to fit exactly inside a container in such a way that the
upper surface U of the lower cube coincides (in our technical sense) with
the lower surface L of the upper cube. Consider two points </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">p</span><span class="auto-style1">and
</span><span class="auto-style2">q</span><span class="auto-style1">
on opposite interior walls of the container and each located on the plane
where the two cubes meet:

<p><br class="auto-style1">
<br class="auto-style1">
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">There are then </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">two</span><span class="auto-style1"> shortest lines connecting the given points:
the line </span><span class="auto-style2">l</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">U</span></sub><span class="auto-style1"> in or on U and the coincident line</span><span class="auto-style2"> l</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">L</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">
in or on L. This implies that 'the geometer's proposition that only one
straight line is conceivable between two points, is strictly speaking false'.
(Brentano 1988, p. 12)
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">The degree of plerosis of a boundary, together with the direction or
directions in which it serves as boundary, yield further criteria in terms
of which boundaries can be classified. As Brentano puts it in his </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">Theory
of Categories</span><span class="auto-style1">:
</span>
</p><blockquote><span class="auto-style1">a point differs spatially in its species [</span><span class="auto-style2">spezifisch</span><span class="auto-style1">]
according to whether it serves as a boundary in all or only in some directions.
Thus a point located inside a physical thing serves as a boundary in all
directions, but a point on a surface or an edge or a vertex serves as a
boundary only in some directions. And the point on a vertex will differ
in its species in accordance with the shape and direction of the vertex.
(Brentano 1981, p. 60)</span></blockquote>
	<span class="auto-style1">In this geometrical sense, then, the boundary is determined in its nature
by the continuum which it bounds.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_13_"><span class="auto-style1">(13)</span></a></sup>
<p class="auto-style1">Boundaries are determined by their hosts also qualitatively or materially:
</p><blockquote class="auto-style1">Imagine the mid-point of a blue circular surface. This appears
as the boundary of numberless straight and crooked blue lines and of arbitrarily
many blue sectors in which the circular area can be thought of as having
been divided. If, however, the surface is made up of four quadrants, of
which the first is white, the second blue, the third red, the fourth yellow,
then we see the mid-point of the circle split apart in a certain way into
a fourness of points. (Brentano 1988, p. 11)</blockquote>
	<span class="auto-style2">Points, therefore, may have parts</span><span class="auto-style1"> (called 'plerotic parts' in what
follows). The parts of a point coincide with each other and with the point
as a whole.
</span>
<blockquote class="auto-style1">Euclid's supposition that a point is that which has no parts
was seen already by Galileo to be in error when he drew attention to the
fact that the mid-point of a circle allows the distinction of just as many
parts as there are points on the circumference, since it differs in a certain
sense as starting point of the different individual radii. (Brentano 1988,
p. 41)</blockquote>
	<span class="auto-style1">Each point within the interior of a two- or three-dimensional continuum
is in fact an infinite (and as it were maximally compressed) collection
of distinct but coincident points: punctiform boundaries of straight and
crooked lines, of two-dimensional segments of surfaces and of interior
regular and irregular cone-shaped portions within three-dimensional continua,
etc. (Not for nothing were the scholastic philosophers exercised by the
question as to how many zero-dimensional beings might be fitted onto the
head of a pin.) This ontological profligacy has its limits, however: the
left punctiform boundary of a one-inch line is identical (and not merely
coincident) with the left punctiform boundary of the corresponding initial
half-inch segment. This is because it is only the immediate neighborhood
of a boundary that is relevant to determining the nature of the boundary
itself.
</span>
<p><span class="auto-style1">Why are plerotic parts important? One reason might be this: that everything
(including you and me) is one. This is the case insofar as everything exists
only in the present moment of time, which is itself a boundary of the past
and future. Everything exists, as Brentano puts it, only </span>
<span class="auto-style2">einer Grenze
nach</span><span class="auto-style1">, or in other words only according to the manner of existing of
a boundary.

<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">We shall orient ourselves in what follows around Chisholm's formalization
of Brentano's ideas in his rich and compressed paper "Spatial Continuity

	<span class="auto-style1">coincidence, and </span><span class="auto-style2">de re

formulated as a step towards ensuring the density of wholes along the lines
presupposed by Chisholm in his comment on A&lt;3 (1992/93, p. 14), for
example a principle of the form:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">T&lt;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x &lt; y

:= z &lt; y-x, a predicate we know is satisfied in virtue of A&lt;3.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Note that T&lt;1 is still rather weak. Thus it does not for example
exclude a world containing only one single point that would be mereologically
complex but only in the sense of containing Brentanian plerotic parts.
(If a soul is zero-dimensional, and if solipsism is true, then the world
would be precisely as thus described.)
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Coincidence</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Coincidence, as we shall here understand the notion, is exclusively
the sort of thing that pertains to boundaries.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_16_"><span class="auto-style1">(16)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Bodies do not coincide (not even with themselves); nor do they coincide
with the spatial regions they occupy. Other sorts of coincidence may be
contemplated, thus for example of </span><span class="auto-style2">the road from Athens to Thebes</span><span class="auto-style1">
with </span><span class="auto-style2">the road from Thebes to Athens</span><span class="auto-style1">, of 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">Bill Clinton</span><span class="auto-style1"> with
	</span><span class="auto-style2">the
President of the United States</span><span class="auto-style1">, of the </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">mind</span><span class="auto-style1"> and its

</span><span class="auto-style2">this
clumsily carved statue</span><span class="auto-style1"> and </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">this lump of bronze</span><span class="auto-style1">. Here, however,
potential generalizations of the theory of coincidence along these lines
are left out of account.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Chisholm's axioms for </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">coincides</span><span class="auto-style1"> are (amended slightly):
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">A~1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ~ y </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">&reg;</span></font><span class="auto-style1">

	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
y ~ z) </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">&reg;</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> x ~ z (transitivity)
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">From which we can easily derive
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">T~1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ~ y </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">&reg;</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
x ~ x (all coincident entities are self-coincident)
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">and plerotic parts can be defined as those parts which self-coincide.
</p><p class="auto-style1">Chisholm adds a further axiom (1992/93, p. 15):
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">(*)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&gt;</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(x

	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">¹</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
y)
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">(possibly coincident entities are possibly such that they coincide with
something other than themselves).
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Here '&lt;&gt;</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">' is an operator of 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">de re</span><span class="auto-style1"> possibility
(read: 'x is possibly such that'). (Later we shall introduce the operator
'[]</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">' for: 'x is necessarily such that'). Note that if, as it
seems reasonable to suppose, all boundaries are self-coincident and all
coincident entities are boundaries, then the first modal operator is redundant,
since being possibly coincident is tantamount to being (self-)coincident.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">We can now postulate as our equivalent of Chisholm's third axiom for
coincidence an axiom asserting the possible non-self-coincidence of self-coincidents:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">A~3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ~ x </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">&reg;</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
&lt;&gt;</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(x ~ y 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
x </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">¹</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> y)
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">(an entity which coincides with itself is of its nature an entity which
can possibly coincide with something other than itself).
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">What Chisholm has in mind in inserting the second modal operator in
(*) is the thesis that every external boundary is possibly such that, through
	</span><span class="auto-style2">touching</span><span class="auto-style1">,
it can come to coincide with the external boundary of
</span><span class="auto-style2">some other thing</span><span class="auto-style1">,
and A~3, even in its revised form, is much too general as a rendering of
this thesis. Indeed it seems on reflection that, in almost every type of
case, the second modal operator is redundant also. This follows from the
considerations on plerosis above. Suppose x is a point or line or internal
surface, then in every case there is some larger continuum which it is
a boundary in or of. x is then either complex, in which case it is actually
(and not merely possibly) coincident with certain of its plerotic proper
parts, or it is simple. In the latter case, however, it is difficult to
conceive of examples which might fit the bill. Even setting x as identical
with the point at the very tip of a cone, for example, would mean that
x has parts, according to our present conception, corresponding to the
indefinite number of points coincident at this tip which serve, respectively,
as the punctiform boundaries of the indefinite number of straight and crooked
lines which there converge.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">An improvement on A~3 might accordingly assert simply, and non-modally:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">A~3*.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ~ x 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">&reg;$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(x
~ y </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> x 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">¹</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
y).
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">In order to capture more closely what Chisholm has in mind in the case
of touching bodies we might then countenance a further axiom to the effect
that self-coincident entities are possibly such as to be coincident with
entities with which they do not overlap:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">A~3**.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x ~ x </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">&reg;</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
&lt;&gt;</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(x ~ y 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">ÙØ</span></font><span class="auto-style1">xOy).
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">We shall not seek to draw out the implications of these axioms here.We
note only that it is primarily in the case of external surfaces where we
would have need for Chisholm's second modal operator: for external surfaces,
unlike boundaries of other sorts, can at any given time coincide at most
with one other entity discrete from themselves, and they do not need to
coincide with any other entity at all.
</p><p class="auto-style1">To do justice to the phenomena in hand we need to add to Chisholm's
axioms a further summing principle to the effect that, if two entities
coincide with two further entities, then the mereological sum of the first
two coincides with the mereological sum of the second two:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">A~4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (x ~ y </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1">

(finite sum)
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">We will also need to add the following principle:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">A~5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [</span><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">$</span></font>y<font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">f</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y

coincides with x, then x coincides with the sum of </span> <font face="Symbol">

</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Thus in particular if x coincides with both y and z, then it coincides

and which has as proper part something which is self-coincident).
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">This definition, taken in conjunction with our schema A&lt;4, does not
impose very strong constraints on 'body'. Thus it allows as bodies not
only scattered bodily collectives,</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_19_"><span class="auto-style1">(19)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
but also, and more worrisomely, randomly assorted collective wholes containing
boundaries and non-boundaries as mutually unconnected parts. It would allow
as bodies wholes consisting of bodies with isolated boundary-like outgrowths,
thus for example an apple from which there protrudes an infinitely thin
line. No formal means can be found to exclude these and other eldritch
creatures from the realm of body in terms of the primitive notions thus
far introduced. We shall accordingly embrace the concept of body as a further
primitive, and seek to exclude these different sorts of counterexample
by imposing constraints by means of axioms.
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Our notion of body is to be conceived widely enough to allow as bodies
both (scattered and non-scattered) collectives of bodies and (scattered
and non-scattered) bodily parts of bodies (for example a sphere of 1-inch
diameter that is abstractly discriminable within a concentric sphere of
2-inch diameter). Later we shall define the narrower concept of </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">substance
</span><span class="auto-style1">which
will exclude these sorts of cases.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">First we impose on bodies a principle to the effect that every body
contains a self-coincident entity as proper part:

</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Second we impose on bodies a constraint of 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">density</span><span class="auto-style1">:

</p><p class="auto-style1">(each body can be divided without remainder into two further bodies
which are discrete).
</p><p class="auto-style1">AK2 rules out the idea that there is a simplest body and it implies
that all bodies are in the relevant sense bulky (are possessed of a certain
material thickness).
</p><p class="auto-style1">Thirdly we assert:

K(y-x) (subtraction)

</p><p class="auto-style1">(the mereological difference between two bodies is in every case a body).
</p><p class="auto-style1">AK3 rules out that bodies may manifest what we might refer to in standard
topological terms as total or partial openness. Thus the interior of a
body (the body minus its exterior boundary) is not a body, by AK3 and TK1,
since the boundary itself is not a body. AK3 guarantees, too, that a hole
or slit in a body always has a certain finite thickness.
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Boundaries</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">We now have two (in the end equivalent) alternatives in regard to the
definition of </span><span class="auto-style2">boundary</span><span class="auto-style1">: on the one hand we might exploit in Chisholmian
fashion the use of </span><span class="auto-style2">de re </span>
	<span class="auto-style1">modalities and define boundaries as entities
that are necessarily such as to exist as parts of bodies; on the other
hand we might exploit the notion of coincidence and define boundaries as
coincident entities. Here we follow Chisholm in taking the former course.
We shall then lay down the interrelation between boundaries and coincidence
by means of an axiom.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Chisholm's D2 (1992/93, p. 16) would seem to amount, in our present
context (where we are dealing exclusively with the spatial case) to the
following definition of boundary:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bx := []</span><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">ð</span></font><sub><span class="auto-style1">x 
	</span> </sub><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y
(Ky </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> x &lt; y)
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">(x is a boundary iff x is necessarily such that there is some body of
which it is a proper part).
</p><p class="auto-style1">Boundaries are necessary proper parts of bodies. This will not do as
it stands, however, first of all because there are other sorts of things
which are necessary parts of this sort. Thus the definition is satisfied
also by the interior of a body (i.e. by the result of deleting from a body
its external boundary). It may be satisfied, too, by minds or souls (though
then the proponent of the Brentano-Chisholm view of boundaries might argue
in turn that minds or souls are themselves a species of zero-dimensional
boundary). It may be that there are boundaries which are not parts of that
which they bound: holes, for example, have boundaries of this sort on the
view defended by Casati and Varzi (1994).
</p><p class="auto-style1">We can easily construct further counterexamples to the definition of
boundary that is here formulated: take x to be the mereological sum of
a banana together with a point on the surface of an apple. Then the point
on the apple is a necessary proper part (it cannot exist without relevant
larger apple-parts), and thus so also is the sum in question (it cannot
exist without analogous larger parts of a banana-including sum); yet x
is not itself a boundary. A more adequate definition of boundary along
Brentanian-Chisholmian lines would therefore be (in keeping with Chisholm's
own approach at p. 85 of his 1989):
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">DB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bx := []</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">"</span></font><span class="auto-style1">z(z

</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">(a boundary is an entity which is as a matter of necessity such that
it </span><span class="auto-style2">and all its parts</span><span class="auto-style1"> are necessary proper parts of bodies).
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">In this way, too, we rule out interiors of bodies (though we seem not
to rule out minds or souls, and other like examples).
</p><p class="auto-style1">Recall our principle to the effect that that which is above all else
characteristic of a continuum is the possibility of a coincidence of boundaries.
Chisholm gives as axiom (1992/93, p. 17):
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bx

</p><p class="auto-style1">A simpler axiom is:

(boundaries are self-coincident)
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Boundaries fall into two classes: punctiform boundaries, which have
no extension, and boundaries of other sorts which share with bodies some
of the extension which the latter in every case enjoy. Defining </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">point</span><span class="auto-style1">

(point)
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">we can then assert by analogy with AK2:

(weak density)
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">(every non-punctiform boundary can be divided into two discrete boundary
parts).
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">If There Be Monsters</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Consider the following superficially attractive density principle:

	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">This asserts that boundaries are thick on the ground (that everything
has or includes one: that boundaries and non-boundaries mutually penetrate).
Unfortunately we can easily prove from this principle that the world is
built up out of boundaries alone (or in other words that the sum total
of everything is equal to the sum total of self-coinciders: </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">s</span></font><span class="auto-style1">x(x

	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that we are able to protect
our theory from a conclusion of this sort. (Recall that one of our reasons
for rejecting the set-theoretical conception of the continuum above was
our rejection of the view that what is extended can somehow be built up
by combining together a sufficiently large number of extensionless parts.)
We are then able to countenance a thought-experiment along the following
lines.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_20_"><span class="auto-style1">(20)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">We define the </span><span class="auto-style2">form</span><span class="auto-style1"> of a body as the sum total of all the boundaries
within it; a body's </span><span class="auto-style2">matter</span><span class="auto-style1"> (its unformed 
	</span><span class="auto-style2">materia prima</span><span class="auto-style1">) can
then be defined as what results when this form is taken away (the latter
is of course merely the abstract result of a purely abstract subtraction,
for form and matter are each as a matter of necessity such that they cannot
exist without the other):
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">DF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form(x) := </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">s</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(y

	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">Note that both the form and the matter of a body are dense; but neither
constitutes a continuum, since a continuum is essentially such as to contain
both boundaries and the things they bound.
</p><p class="auto-style1">But now other such artefacts can be constructed (or defined within our
theory). Given any point within the interior of a body, we can define its
left- and right-directed point-counterparts, two different sorts of punctiform
plerotic parts within the given point, as follows: take a spherical neighborhood
around the given point as center, and imagine a vertical plane bisecting
the neighborhood. Then the left-directed points (LDP's) are all those points
coincident with the given point which serve as boundaries in directions
properly included within the left hemisphere, the right-directed points
(RDP's) are all those points coincident with the given point which serve
as boundaries in directions properly included within the left hemisphere.
We can now define two new sorts of bodily parts: the left- and right-point-surrogates
of a body, respectively:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">DLPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LPS(x) := </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">s</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(y

&lt; x </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> RDPy).
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">The principle that from extensionless points extended wholes can never
be constructed implies that these peculiar bodily surrogates are strictly
distinct from the body itself with which we begin. They are analogues,
within our mereotopological framework, of the space-filling curves, the
Menger-Sierpinski sponges and the deleted Tychonoff planks of standard
set theory.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_22_"><span class="auto-style1">(22)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">
	</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Such monsters force us to be on our guard when formulating axioms and
definitions, since our definitions may be satisfied by the monsters in
question even though the latter correspond in no wise to the intuitive
understanding which these definitions were designed to express. If, on
the other hand, we accept the density principle (**) above, and swallow
the consequences which we have otherwise seen reason to reject, then we
thereby exclude these eldritch creatures by having them collapse onto each
other and onto their respective bodies. This in turn, however, will carry
a further price to the effect that our initial mereological axioms will
have to be adjusted. Specifically, the standard ('additive') mereological
summing principle will need to be replaced by a principle which allows
that the sum of two objects may contain as parts objects which do not overlap
with either of the two objects with which we begin.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_23_"><span class="auto-style1">(23)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">

</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Varieties of Connectedness</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">A pair of spatial entities are in contact each other directly when
their respective boundaries, in whole or in part, coincide. Chisholm defines</span><span class="auto-style2">
direct contact </span><span class="auto-style1">as follows (1992/93, p. 16):
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">x is in direct spatial contact with y := a constituent of x spatially
coincides with a constituent of y. (1992/93, p. 16)
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Unfortunately, however, this definition does not work in the general
case. Thus for example it cannot capture the case in which a point-boundary
x inside the interior of a body y is in direct contact with the punctured
neighborhood y-</span><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">s</span></font><span class="auto-style1">z(z~x). We can, however, define
a relation of direct contact for bodies:
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">DDCOK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xDCOKy := Kx 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1">

(bodily direct contact)
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Note, however, that this definition imposes no constraint of connectedness
on either x or y or their sum. Consider the case where x is the mereological
sum of a banana and a point on an apple, y the mereological sum of some
coincident point on the same apple together with a second banana some miles
distant from the first. We then have xDCOKy even though the whole x </span> <font face="Symbol">
	<span class="auto-style1">&egrave;</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
y is not connected.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">At this point Chisholm writes:
</p><blockquote class="auto-style1">A thing that turns back on itself (e.g. a tire, a hoop, or
a doughnut) is in contact with itself. Lines and surfaces can turn back
on themselves. (1992/93, p. 17)</blockquote>
	<span class="auto-style1">A pliable rod, it seems clear, can be turned back upon itself in some special
sense (the two ends can be brought into contact with each other). But surely
the sense in which a doughnut is in contact with itself applies to all
connected bodies (consider v in DDCOK as the right boundary of the left
hemisphere of a sphere, w as the left boundary of the right hemisphere
of the same sphere). Indeed it follows from our considerations on internal
boundaries above that xDCOKx holds for every body x, since every body is
large or thick enough to contain at least two coincident entities as parts.

<p><span class="auto-style3">Touching</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">In fact, to do justice to what Chisholm has in mind, we must therefore
distinguish </span><span class="auto-style2">touching</span><span class="auto-style1"> as a special case of direct contact which applies
only to coincident parts of external boundaries of mutually discrete bodies:
an entity x touches an entity y if each is such that it can exist without
detriment even should the other be destroyed. We might, accordingly, introduce
a new primitive 'exists' (symbolized by 'E!') and formulate a definition
along the lines of:

now, in that we can separate this sum of coincident boundaries without

<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Our gloss on the primitive concept of

can fall short of being substances in two different ways: (1) in being
too big, they contain two or more bodies as non-connected parts; (2) in
being too small: they are parts of larger connected bodies (as one solid
metal sphere may be discriminable inside a second, larger sphere).</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_26_"><span class="auto-style1">(26)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">

following Chisholm,</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_27_"><span class="auto-style1">(27)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1"> that substances
are connected bodies. To exclude counterexamples of the second sort we

</p><p class="auto-style1">(a substance is a connected body which is such that if it serves as
part of a larger connected body then this only because it touches some
second body).
</p><p class="auto-style1">Note that DS is consistent with the fact that substances may have holes
of various shapes and sizes.
</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Dimensions</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Boundaries can be classified according to the number of their dimensions.
Thus we can distinguish one-, two- and three-dimensional continua and we
can even contemplate continua of higher numbers of dimensions. From Brentano's
point of view, a continuum
</span>
</p><blockquote class="auto-style1">is to be designated as one-dimensional if it has no other boundaries
than such as are not themselves continuous.  The spatial line, too, has
no boundaries other than non-extended ones, namely the spatial points,
and it is for this reason that Euclid defined the point as that which has
no parts. The surface, in contrast, belongs with the two-dimensional continua
since its boundaries comprehend not only points but also lines. And a body
is to be designated as a three-dimensional continuum since not only is
the whole body bounded by a surface but so also each one of its parts is
separated from the remainder by a surface that is a two-dimensional boundary.
(1988, p. 10)</blockquote>

<p><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Chisholm's approach to the problem of dimension is to begin by defining
</span><span class="auto-style2">surface</span><span class="auto-style1">
as follows:
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SFx := Bx </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> &lt;&gt;</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">x</span></sub><font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ø$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y
(x &lt; y </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> By)
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">(a surface is a boundary - an envelope - which is possibly such that
it is not a proper part of a boundary).
</p><p class="auto-style1">One problem with this definition, conceived as a definition of what
we normally think of as two-dimensional boundaries, turns on the fact that
there might be what Brentano calls 'topoids' of four or more dimensions,
whose boundaries would satisfy the definition yet would not be surfaces
in the intended (two-dimensional) sense. This we might solve by means of
an axiom ruling out such cases, for example by setting as axiom:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">"</span></font>x<font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(Ky

<font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">Ù</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
x </span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">£</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> y)
	</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">This will serve our purposes, however, only if we know in advance that
bodies have always exactly three dimensions. This in its turn cannot be
stipulated as an axiom unless we already have a concept of dimension at
our disposal. No simple way out of this impasse presents itself, though
for the moment we can follow Chisholm and impose (in effect) the requirement
that the range of variables of our theory be restricted to spatial objects
of three or less than three dimensions.
</p><p class="auto-style1">Another problem with Chisholm's proposed definition of surface is that
it does not do justice to what we might call open surfaces, surfaces which
are arbitrarily delineated sub-regions of other, larger surfaces.
</p><p class="auto-style1">A better definition can be achieved if we use an earlier proposal (advanced
by Chisholm in his 1989, p. 88) and define surfaces by appealing to the
fact that a surface, unlike other boundaries, can coincide at most with
one other surface (where points and lines can coincide with an infinity
of other points and lines). We then have (provisionally and tentatively):
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">DSF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SFx := Bx </span> <font face="Symbol">

</p><p><span class="auto-style3">Points, Lines and Surfaces</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">We have already given the following definition of point:

</p><p class="auto-style1">The problem with a definition of this sort is that, as we have seen,
the mereological sum of coincident points (the red, green, blue points
at the center of a disk divided into three differently colored segments)
is itself a point, and thus such as to have proper parts.
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Chisholm seeks to define </span>
	<span class="auto-style2">line</span><span class="auto-style1"> as follows (1992/93, p. 19):

</p><p><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LNx

	<span class="auto-style1">Ø</span></font><span class="auto-style1">
SFx.
</span>
</p><p class="auto-style1">A line would then be a boundary which has parts but is not a surface.
To rule out complex points from counting as lines, the middle conjunct
needs to be adjusted to:
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	</span> <font face="Symbol"><span class="auto-style1">$</span></font><span class="auto-style1">y(y

~ y).
</span>
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Sums of separate boundaries (pairs of separate points, sums of points
and lines, etc.) would still provide counterexamples to the definition.
To solve these difficult problems in the space available to us here we
therefore introduce the notion of sameness of dimension (=</span><sub><span class="auto-style1">dim</span></sub><span class="auto-style1">)
as an additional primitive notion of our theory.</span><sup><a href="/smith/articles/chisholm/chisholm.html#N_28_"><span class="auto-style1">(28)</span></a></sup><span class="auto-style1">

</p><p class="auto-style1">A similar operation will now have to be mounted in order to distinguish
genuine surfaces from surface-complexes which arise where surfaces cross
or split. (We shall then need to reexamine our definition of line-complex,
which employs our earlier, provisional definition of surface.)
</p><p><span class="auto-style1">Even when this is done, much will have been left unsaid. Thus we have
not specified that points are parts of lines, that lines are parts of surfaces.
Thus </span><span class="auto-style2">a fortiori </span>
	<span class="auto-style1">we have not said either that lines are not mere
sums of points and that surfaces are not mere sums of lines. Nor have we
said that lines and surfaces </span><span class="auto-style2">have</span><span class="auto-style1"> boundaries. We have not defined
the single dimensions, nor ruled out fractional dimensions, and nor have
we said that points, lines and surfaces are entities of zero, one and two
dimensions, respectively. All of these things need to be proved, or stipulated
axiomatically on the basis of intuitively reasonable, sound and satisfactory
mereotopological considerations. Only then will we have more than the beginnings
of a theory of boundaries and coincidence.

</span>
</p><p><a name="N_7_"></a><span class="auto-style1">7. Brentano even went so far as to identify boundaries
as special sorts of universals:
</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;
</span>
</p><blockquote class="auto-style1">Because a boundary, even when itself continuous, can never
exist except as belonging to something continuous of more dimensions (indeed
receives its fully determinate and exactly specific character only through
the manner of this belongingness), it is, considered for itself, nothing
other than a universal, to which as to other universals more than one thing
can correspond. (Brentano 1988, p. 12)</blockquote>
<a name="N_8_"></a><span class="auto-style1">8. See for example his 1989a, pp. 115, 157.
	</span>
<p><a name="N_9_"></a><span class="auto-style1">9. An alternative view along these lines is defended
by Brentano in the following passage:
</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;
</span>
<br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;
</span>
</p><blockquote class="auto-style1">What is continuous can be sub-divided  into what is continuously
many and what is continuously manifold.  As an example of the continuously
many we can give a body, of the continuously manifold someone who sees
something spatial precisely in so far as he sees it. The body is a unity
which can be decomposed into a plurality in such a way that if one of its
parts is destroyed the remainder can continue to exist just as it was before.
 Things are quite different in the case of someone who intuits something
spatially extended. This someone is as such not something simple but something
manifold, since he sees not merely one but many parts of a continuum and
could go on to see one such part while he ceases to see the others. But
in so far as he sees the one part he does not amount to something totally
other than what he is in so far as he sees the other part. We have before
us not a duality, as we would have in the case where it was one who sees
this part and another who sees that.  I cannot speak of a plurality of
unities here but only of the manifold character of something that is itself
one.  This distinction between the continuously many and the continuously
manifold was borne insufficiently in mind by Aristotle when he inferred
a spatial extension of the sensing subject from the spatial extension of
the objects of sense. The consideration of what is given when someone who
momentarily presents to himself a temporal continuum could have kept him
from this false conclusion. (Brentano 1988, pp. 32f.)</blockquote>
<a name="N_10_"></a><span class="auto-style1">10. Brentano 1981, p. 56: translation corrected. The
continuum is specifically dependent on its boundary, but the boundary is
not in this same sense dependent on its continuum; it is only generically
so. See &sect; 10 of Smith 1992 for further discussion of this generic
dependence of boundaries upon their hosts.
</span>
<p><a name="N_11_"></a><span class="auto-style1">11. See Brentano 1988, pp. 10f. A line stretching
from the surface of the sphere to its midpoint is partly internal, partly
external. Note that a boundary on the surface of a cavity inside a sphere
is an external boundary, in our present terminology.
</span>
</p><p><a name="N_12_"></a><span class="auto-style1">12. Since boundaries in general exist always in
consort with, and are determined in their nature by the things they bound,
we might think of boundaries as being 'unsaturated' in something like Frege's
sense, which is to say: they need to be completed in certain predetermined
ways and in certain predetermined directions.
</span>
</p><p><a name="N_13_"></a><span class="auto-style1">13. Note that, if a boundary is determined essentially
by the direction in which it bounds, then the following question presents
itself: if a point is the interior boundary of a straight line and the
line becomes bent into a semi-circle, does the point retain its identity?
</span>
</p><p><a name="N_14_"></a><span class="auto-style1">14. This is in fact a slightly weakened version
of Chisholm's remainder principle:

</p><p><font face="Times"><span class="auto-style1">The latter would imply that atoms do not exist, an
implication which, for the sake of neutrality and generality, we here wish
to avoid.</span></font><span class="auto-style1"> </span>
</p><p><a name="N_15_"></a><span class="auto-style1">15. Varzi 1994 provides an extended treatment of
the problems here at issue.
</span>
</p><p><a name="N_16_"></a><span class="auto-style1">16. To aid his intuitions, the reader might provisionally
view coincidence as a relation which obtains between two boundaries whenever
they occupy exactly the same spatial location.
</span>
</p><p><a name="N_17_"></a><span class="auto-style1">17. See for example chapter 1 of Steen and Seebach
1978.
</span>
</p><p><a name="N_18_"></a><span class="auto-style1">18. This definition is formulated by Chisholm in
terms of the notions: individual thing, part, coincidence and possibility.
We note in passing that there is a question whether the concept of what
is spatial can truly be defined exclusively by means of such purely formal,
abstract notions.

</p><p><a name="N_21_"></a><span class="auto-style1">21. These definitions may capture part of what is
involved in the insight that bodies, in contrast to boundaries, are bulky:
'matter', on our present conception, is another term for bulk.

</p><p><span class="auto-style1">This will not work, however, as can be seen if we take a connected line
x, and define y as the result of subtracting from x the sum z of all points
in x coincident with a given interior point. We must return to this issue
later, when we have a notion of </span><span class="auto-style2">sameness of dimension</span><span class="auto-style1"> (and when
we are in a position to eliminate punctured entities and other similar

for boundaries, the definition of x BK y would enable us to formulate the
