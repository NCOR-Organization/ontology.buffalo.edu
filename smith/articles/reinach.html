</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Preamble</B>
<P>At the one extreme stands Hume, who - at least according to common conceptions
- rules out entirely the possibility of material or non-logical necessity,
and who therefore rules out also the possibility that we might enjoy that
sort of certain knowledge that earlier philosophers had assumed as a matter
of course to be correlated therewith.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2) </A></SUP>At
the other extreme stands Adolf Reinach, the hero of our present story,
who defends the existence of a wide class of material necessities falling
within the domain of what can be <I>a priori</I> known. More precisely,
Reinach holds that there are certain categories of entity whose factual
instantiation brings with it as a matter of necessity the instantiation
of certain other correlated categories. The instantiation of the category
<I>colour</I>
necessitates in this fashion the instantiation of the category
<I>visual
extension</I>. Such categories are to be understood, from Reinach's point
of view, after the fashion of Plato's intelligible forms. Thus they constitute
an autonomous, natural order that is not capable of being invented or constructed
through acts of man; they are such that actual things and events may serve
to instantiate them more or less completely or perfectly; and they are
such that we enjoy in relation to them (and therefore also in relation
to their instances) a special sort of non-inductive knowledge. More consistently
than Plato, however, Reinach acknowledges the existence of systems of relations
through which the given categories are tied together into larger wholes.
Such categories are then intrinsically intelligible precisely as nodes
in this system of relations of the given sort, in the sense that anyone
who has experience (including imaginative experience) of relevant instances
of these categories is implicitly aware also of a corresponding family
of relations. It is such intrinsic intelligibility of the basic structures
and interrelations of shape and motion, colour and sound, for example,
which makes it possible for us to learn language and to acquire those sorts
of <I>a posteriori</I> knowledge on which empirical science is based.
<P>Midway between these two extremes stands Searle. Like Hume, Searle is
unwilling to accept special, uninventable categories whose instances would
stand in necessary relations to each other. Like Reinach, however, Searle
believes that there are categories of entity whose factual instantiation
brings with it as a matter of necessity the factual instantiation of other
correlated categories. The corresponding categories are for him not eternal
and uninventable, however, but human creations, and the necessities in
question are purely logical consequences of the `constitutive rules' by
which the given categories are brought into being. As for Vico and Hobbes,
so also for Searle, it is only in relation to what a human being has made
that he or she is able to enjoy certain knowledge.
<P>The essay which follows has two principal goals. On the one hand I shall
summarize Reinach's thinking in connection with the issues of apriorism
and material necessity. On the other hand I shall seek to demonstrate that
Searle does not, after all, occupy a stable and acceptable half-way house
between Hume and Reinach. Searle, too, if he is to be able to do justice
to the establishment and to the workings of constitutive rules, must on
pain of circularity embrace something like the Reinachian Platonism outlined
above.
<P>There is a commonsensical assumption to the effect, other things being
equal, we can infer from: `John promised to do such-and-such' to: `John
is obligated to do such-and-such'. Humeans (most philosophers, today) hold
that the inference in question is invalid, that an `ought' can under no
circumstances be derived from an `is'. Reinach holds that our commonsensical
recognition of the validity of the given inference flows from our possession
of synthetic <I>a priori</I> knowledge of a certain relation of necessitation
between the categories in question. Searle, for his part, would have it
that we have <I>made</I> the institution of promising and that as a result
certain inferences are valid because they reflect the man-made rules of
that institution.
<P>It will turn out that speech act phenomena manifest in a particularly
clear form the necessitation-structures which will be at the heart of our
theory of the <I>a priori</I>. Thus I shall start with a brief excursus
on the somewhat obscure history of philosophers' deliberations on such
phenomena. This history has, I believe, some independent interest of its
own, and will provide in addition some useful background for those interested
in pursuing further the underpinnings of the Reinachian theory here defended.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>On the Theory of Speech Acts</B>
<P>In the fourth chapter of his <I>De interpretatione</I>, Aristotle draws
a distinction between two sorts of sentences. On the one hand, he says,
there are `statement-making sentences'. On the other hand there are sentences,
such as for example requests, `in which there is no truth or falsity' (17
a 1-5). The latter, Aristotle affirms, can be dismissed from logic, since
consideration of them `belongs rather to the study of rhetoric or poetry.'
Aristotle's attitude here, which remained authoritative throughout the
Middle Ages, had fateful consequences. For his remarks ensured that the
treatment of non-statement-making sentences came to be banished not merely
from logic, but from the realm of science in general.
<P>His remarks seem to have been explicitly challenged only towards the
end of the 18th century in the work on `social acts' of Thomas Reid.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)
</A></SUP>Reid's
ideas in this connection remained without substantial influence, however,
and it was not until the early years of the present century that the project
of a theory of linguistic action began to take more definitive shape. More
precisely, it is in a monograph on the foundations of the civil law, published
in 1913 by our hero Reinach, that we find the first truly systematic theory
of the phenomena of promising, questioning, requesting, commanding, accusing,
enacting, etc., phenomena which Reinach, like Reid before him, collects
together under the heading `social acts'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)
</A></SUP>Certainly
there were philosophers other than Reid and Reinach who had considered
the nature of promisings and other social acts. Such philosophers sought,
however in silent tribute to the assumption of Aristotle that only statement-making
sentences belong properly to the realm of logic to reassign such phenomena
to the realm of statements or declarations. Thus Bolzano, for example,
considers the act of questioning as a statement, to the effect that the
questioner `desires to receive instruction about the object in question'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)
</A></SUP>The act of promising, similarly, is seen by Hume, Lipps and others
as the expression of an act of will or as the declaration of an intention
to act in the interests of the party in whose favour the declaration is
made. There is an obvious inadequacy of all accounts of promising along
these lines, however, namely that they throw no light at all on the problem
of how an utterance of the given sort can give rise to claim and obligation.
The bare intention to do something has, after all, no quasi-legal consequences
of this sort, and it is difficult to see why things should be different
in reflection of the fact that such an intention is brought to expression
in language.
<P>Certainly <I>promising</I> and <I>communicating one's intention to do
something</I> do have much in common. Thus both belong to the category
of what Reinach calls <I>spontaneous</I> acts, i.e. acts which involve
a subject's bringing something about within his own psychic sphere as contrasted
with passive or receptive experiences of, say, feeling a pain or hearing
an explosion.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6) </A></SUP>Both are, moreover, acts
which involve as a matter of necessity a linguistic utterance or some other
<I>overt
performance</I> of a non-natural (in the sense of conventional or rule-governed)
sort. This does not hold of other spontaneous acts such as judging or deciding,
nor even of the acts of cursing or forgiving,<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)
</A></SUP>but
it does hold of apologizing, commanding, accusing, entreating etc. Spontaneous
acts can accordingly be divided into two classes, which we might call <I>internal</I>
and <I>external</I>, respectively, according to whether the act's being
brought to overt expression is a separable or inseparable moment of the
relevant complex whole.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP>
<P>Spontaneous acts are in every case <I>intentional</I>, which is to say
that there is a (not necessarily existent) object or objects towards which
they are directed. Spontaneous acts may in addition however be directed
(in a different sense, now) to a subject or subjects, and most typically
to a fellow human being. Amongst such subject-directed acts we may distinguish
further between those which are <I>self-directable</I> and those which
are <I>non-self-directable</I> (the latter Reinach also calls <I>other-directed</I>
or <I>"fremdpersonal"</I>). The former are such that the subject toward
whom they are directed may be identical with the subject of the act (as
in cases of self-pity, self-hatred, etc.). The latter, in contrast, demand
as that toward which they are directed a subject other than the one who
acts.
<P>Non-self-directable acts may be either internal (for example feelings
of envy or resentment), or external (for example acts of baptism or benediction).
Certain acts having the property of being both external and non-self-directable
are in addition such that the relevant utterance must of necessity not
only be directed toward but also <I>addressed to</I> and thereby <I>registered</I>
or <I>grasped by</I> the subject in question. A command must as a matter
of necessity be received and understood by the one to whom it is addressed
(something which does not apply, for example, to an act of baptizing, forgiving
or cursing). A command, that is to say,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>is an action of the subject to which is essential not only
its spontaneity and its intentionality, but also its being directed towards
other subjects and its standing in need of being grasped by those subjects.
What has been said of commands holds also for requesting, admonishing,
questioning, informing, answering, and many other types of act. They are
all social acts which are, in their execution, cast by him who executes
them toward another subject that they may affix themselves in his mind
[<I>einem anderen zugeworfen, um sich in seine Seele einzuhaken</I>]. (Reinach
1913, p. 707, cf. Eng. pp. 19f.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
What is important about an action of this kind is that it
<BLOCKQUOTE>is not divided into the self-sufficient execution of an act
and an accidental statement [<I>zuf&auml;llige Konstatierung</I>]; rather
it constitutes an inner unity of deliberate execution and deliberate utterance.
The experience is here impossible in the absence of the utterance. And
the utterance for its part is not something that is added thereto as an
incidental extra; rather it stands in the service of the social act and
is necessary in order that this should fulfil its announcing function [<I>kundgebende
Funktion</I>]. Certainly there exist also incidental statements relating
to social acts: "I have just issued the command." But such statements then
relate to the whole social act, <I>with</I> its external aspect (op. cit.,
p. 708, cf. Eng. p. 20).</BLOCKQUOTE>
Social acts, then, for Reinach (exactly as for Reid), involve
<BLOCKQUOTE>activities of mind which do not merely find in words their
accidental, supplemental expression, but which execute themselves in the
very act of speaking itself and of which it is characteristic that they
announce themselves to another by means of this or some similar external
appearance. (Op. cit., p. 728, cf. Eng. p. 36.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
The closeness to Austin and later speech act theorists here is unmistakable.
A promise cannot be the merely incidental expression or intimation of an
act of will or of an intention, because the act which underlies a promise
is such that it is simply (and as a matter of necessity) not able to exist
outside the compass of a whole of just this sort. And similarly there is
no independent and self-contained mental experience which is somehow brought
to expression, incidentally, in the issuing of a command. Hence, <I>a fortiori</I>,
a social act of this sort cannot be a mere report or declaration of such
an experience.
<P>To say that there are experiences of such a nature that they exist only
if they or their contents are simultaneously brought to expression might
seem controversial the very existence of mutual dependence here implies
that it is possible to separate experience and expression only abstractly
(that it is in a certain sense illegitimate to speak of two distinct factors
here at all). In some cases, however, the existence of an underlying experience
is clear. Consider, trivially, the very experience of <I>bringing to expression
</I>itself.
Acts of warning, apologizing, promising, commanding, and so on, are likewise,
Reinach holds, necessarily such that they cannot exist except in and through
the very act by which they are brought to expression.
<P>Actions of promising and commanding possess, then, as Reinach would
have it, not merely an external dimension of utterance and execution, but
also an internal dimension, through which they are tied into the domain
of mental acts. The given phenomena are further such that they presuppose
or are founded on appropriate mental states, for example of belief, and
also on states of other kinds, for example the relational state of authority.
In this way phenomena of the given sort are multi-categorial: their constituent
relations of necessitation span regions of (mental, linguistic, legal and
behavioural, factual and normative) reality and combine together into new
structures elements derived from each.
<P>We are far from having dealt with every aspect of Reinach's theory here.
Thus we could have considered his treatment of conditional acts, of sham
and defective and incomplete acts, of acts performed jointly and severally,
of social acts performed <I>in the name of</I> some other party, of the
ways in which such acts can be overridden and undermined, and so on.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)
</A></SUP>One
aspect of Reinach's work to which we shall return is the way in which his
account of social acts is complemented by a theory of legal formations
and of the ways in which the universal categories of promise, obligation,
etc. are related to the contingent and pragmatically motivated higher-order
social acts of the positive law. Reinach's most important contribution,
however, at least for our present purposes, is to have drawn attention
to the central role of necessitation relations in the sphere of social
action and to have grasped the fact that our synthetic <I>a priori
</I>knowledge
is in large part precisely knowledge of structures held together by relations
of the given sort. Necessitation relations had, it is true, been recognized
earlier, above all by Husserl and other followers of Brentano in the sphere
of psychology. It was Reinach, however, and his fellow Munich phenomenologists,
who demonstrated the pervasiveness of the corresponding structures and
who showed also how an absolutely general theory of <I>a priori</I> knowledge
can be built up on this basis.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>The Ontology of Necessitation Relations</B>
<P>It is an intriguing question whether Reinach's work exerted a direct
or indirect influence on the development of speech act theory in Oxford
in the '40s and '50s.<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10) </A></SUP>More important
for us here, however, is the nature and content of Reinach's theory itself.
The Anglo-Saxon treatment of speech act phenomena arose, familiarly, at
a time when philosophy was conceived as a rather informal matter of `conceptual
geography'. Reinach, in contrast, treats of speech acts and related phenomena
ontologically. That is, he sees promises, claims, obligations, etc., as
entities of certain special sorts, embrangled together in systematic ways
with entities of certain other special sorts (for example with people,
and with acts and states). Social acts are part of the very stock of the
world, and not for example mere reflections of our conventional ways of
speaking about other, more humdrum entities. This ontological treatment
of necessitation <I>in re</I> will generate, as we shall see, a corresponding
ontological theory of the <I>a priori.</I>
<P>The world <I>contains</I> promisings, claims, commands, requests, marryings,
and relations of authority, just as it contains instances of biological
and logical species such as <I>lion</I> and <I>tiger</I> or
<I>judging</I>
and <I>inferring</I>. The species which people the world can be divided
further into two sorts. On the one hand are <I>independent species</I>,
whose instances do not require instantiations of other species in order
to exist.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11) </A></SUP><I>Lion</I> might be taken
as an example of an independent species in this sense. On the other hand
are <I>dependent species</I> such as <I>smile </I>or <I>dent</I>, whose
instances do not exist in and of themselves but only in association with
instances of complementary species of other determinate sorts. Wherever
instances of dependent species exist, there exist also relations of ontological
necessitation. The inference from promise to obligation reflects an ontological
necessitation of this sort, as also (in Descartes' eyes at least) does
the inference from <I>cogito</I> to <I>sum</I>. Furthermore, where such
positive necessitation holds, there obtain also certain correlated constraints
or exclusions in a negative direction. Thus for example since colour depends
for its existence upon extension, it follows that it is excluded as a matter
of necessity that two distinct colours should occupy the same area or volume
of space. The family of necessitation-relations extends, in this way, to
fill out the entire sphere of what, traditionally, had been seen as the
domain of <I>a priori</I> knowledge.
<P>There is a rigid, autonomous order to the association or connection
of dependent and independent entities. As Husserl puts it:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not a peculiarity of certain sorts of parts that they
should only be parts in general, while it would remain quite indifferent
what conglomerates with them, and into what sorts of contexts they are
fitted. Rather there obtain firmly determined relations of necessity, ...
determinate laws, which vary with the species of dependent contents and
accordingly prescribe one sort of completion to one of them, another sort
of completion to another. (1900/01, pp. 244f., cf. Eng. p. 454)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Judging</I> is an example of a dependent species in Husserl's sense:
a judging exists only as the judging of some specific subject (as a smile
smiles only in a human face). <I>Promising</I>, too, is an example of a
dependent species. Here, however, we see that the dependence is multifold:
a promise requires that there be at least also the instantiations of species
<I>claim</I>,
<I>obligation</I>, <I>utterance</I> and <I>registering act</I>, reticulated
together with language-using subjects in a single whole. As Austin himself
recognized, every speech act is dependent on its surrounding circumstances,
as it is dependent also on being heard (on uptake, or `<I>Vernehmung</I>'
in Reinach's terminology).<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12) </A></SUP>Much more
than Austin, however, Reinach was able to do systematic justice to the
entire family of such necessitation relations within the framework of a
single theory.
<P>Such necessitation relations may be either one-sided or mutual. As an
example of the latter, consider the relation of reciprocal dependence between
the claim and obligation brought into being automatically with the execution
of an act of promising. Or consider the relation between what Reinach calls
the internal and external moments of the promising act. Both internal intending
act and external utterance-phenomenon are, as we have seen, not able to
exist outside the compass of a whole of just this sort. Intending act and
utterance-phenomena are accordingly only superficially similar to intending
acts or utterance-phenomena of the sort that are able to exist outside
the framework of a promise.
<P>The given features of the promise are marked also by a special <I>a
priori </I>quality: they seem to be something of which we know not merely
through experiment or observation or induction but rather immediately and
(in principle) on even cursory acquaintance with phenomena of the relevant
sort. They can be grasped without further ado, in the way that we grasp,
for example, that red is darker than yellow, that blue is not a shape,
that nothing can be simultaneously red and green all over, and so on. The
categories in question (promise, colour, shape, etc.) seem in some way
to be prior to any given factual realization. The corresponding necessary
laws can be grasped as necessary even in the absence of factual instantiations.
<P>As the six Platonic solids constrain factually existing processes of
crystal-formation, so the categories distinguished by Reinach as basic
to the sphere of social acts constrain factually existing institutions.
They provide, as it were, a restricted range of natural and in a certain
sense inevitable alternatives within the framework of which institutions
must then be formed.<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13) </A></SUP>Through deliberately
contrived institutional arrangements, thus through acts of lawgivers and
others, such uninventable categories may become modified, in particular
cultures and times, above all in the sense that the range of their particular
realizations may become narrowed in specific ways. Thus for example it
may very well be that in some given society a contract acquires validity
only when it bears a certain official stamp. As Reinach saw, however, each
such modification must be in keeping with the intrinsically intelligible
category which serves as its starting point: hence the given conventional
modifications are themselves constrained by certain necessary and intelligible
laws. Thus there could be no culture or society in which the validity of
contracts is in general made conditional on the parties' undergoing painful
surgery, or on the finding of a proof for some hitherto unproved conjecture
in mathematics. The absurdity of such modifications is grasped immediately
by anyone with even a cursory familiarity with entities of the sorts involved.
It is an <I>a priori</I> absurdity.
<P>Interestingly, we have to deal here with entities existing in different
ways in time. Obligations, claims and for example marital ties are (relational
and non-relational) <I>states</I> of the corresponding objects. Their dependence
consists in the fact that they cannot <I>endure</I> unless relevant bearers
exist.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14) </A></SUP>The spontaneous acts discussed
above, on the other hand, are instantaneous <I>events</I>: their dependence
consists in the fact that they cannot <I>occur</I> unless their bearers
exist. Now, however, we see that dependence relations can obtain not merely
between states or events and their bearers, but also forwards and backwards
in time, between the states and events themselves, and even between states
and events of different bearers. Thus if, as a matter of fact, certain
actions are performed by a suitably authorized speaker under such and such
conditions, then as a matter of necessity there begin to exist certain
claims and obligations involving this speaker (or his principal) and certain
other persons. These claims and obligations then exist for a certain time
thereafter, and it may be that an end to their existence can be brought
about by further social acts (for example by acts of waiving a claim),
whose corresponding effects will then be no less necessary and automatic
(and grasped <I>a priori </I>as such).
<P>It is to repeat once more Reinach's point in reflection of our prior
knowledge of the necessary relations which here obtain that we are able
to derive the `ought' of obligation (such and such a person ought to do
such and such) from the `is' which is expressed in a certain factual statement
(to the effect that an utterance-phenomenon of a certain sort has occurred
at a certain time and under such and such conditions).
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>The Logical Conception of Material Necessity</B>
<P>There is a deep-rooted temptation, now, to suppose that such <I>a priori</I>
necessities are one and all a matter of the logical relations which hold
among the corresponding concepts. An account along these lines does indeed
enjoy considerable purchase in relation to necessary laws in the purely
formal spheres of for example mathematics. Such an account has however
failed repeatedly when the attempt has been made to extend it to the necessary
laws obtaining in such material spheres as those of colours or tones or
social acts.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15) </A></SUP>To say of the truths of
mathematics that they are `formal' is to say that they are topic-neutral,
that they are not specific to any given qualitative or material sphere.<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)
</A></SUP>Such
truths can at least in principle be applied unrestrictedly to all qualitative
or material regions (as one can count, for example, everything from ring
nebulae to canzonettas). When once the transition is made to laws whose
content involves a restriction to what is qualitatively or materially determined,
however, the logical account can no longer be successfully applied.
<P>This follows from the ineliminable presence of materially specific concepts
(or corresponding terms) in the formulations of these laws themselves.
On the logical account, propositions or sentences seemingly expressing
material necessities are seen as being characterized by the fact that they
can in every case be exposed as mere analytic truths which are entirely
empty of content. Such exposure is effected via a process of stripping
out defined terms, replacing each such term with a <I>definiens</I> consisting
of more primitive expressions. `All bachelors are unmarried' is revealed
as analytic in this way, by being converted to `All unmarried men are unmarried',
a substitution instance of the logical truth: `All A's which are B are
B'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP>
<P>If, however, we wish to hold on to the view that all the necessary propositions
of the theory of (say) social acts are analytic in this sense, then we
shall have to insist that all such propositions can be formulated in terms
of at most one single primitive non-logical concept. For suppose that even
two such concepts were needed, say and , neither (by hypothesis) definable
in terms of the other. Consider now the propositions expressing relations
between and , even such trivial relations as the relation of non-identity.
These cannot (again by hypothesis) be analytic. For propositions expressing
non-identity of concepts (green is not yellow, colour is not sound) are
clearly not substitution-instances of logical truths as they stand. But
there are (again by hypothesis) no defined non-logical terms which could
be eliminated in such a way as to reveal the corresponding statements as
logically true. But nor (again by hypothesis) can they be merely factual.
On the logical reading of necessity, however, no further alternative is
available, which implies that the original assumption that there are two
(or more) such concepts must be rejected.
<P>When, however, we consider the wealth of independent concepts involved
in the theory of social acts concepts of language, of mental acts of intending,
willing, registering, of mental states of sincerity and good faith, of
obligation, claim, authority, concepts of action and performance, etc.
then it is clearly impossible that the entire family of such concepts might
be capable of being reduced, by a process of definition, to at most one
single non-logical primitive. The corresponding laws, therefore, or the
bulk of them at least, are matters of non-logical necessity, and our corresponding
knowledge of such laws is synthetic and <I>a priori.</I>
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>Institutional Concepts and Constitutive Rules</B>
<P>If we cannot understand the necessary laws which obtain in the sphere
of social acts in purely logical terms, then how are we to understand them?
Reinach, as we have seen, adopts a Platonistic answer to this question,
an answer according to which there obtain necessary and intelligible relations
between categories of certain sorts (for example promises, claims and obligations)
as these are realized in the world. It is in reflection of our knowledge
of such relations that the derivation of `ought' from `is' in the case
of the promise is grasped as valid<I> a priori</I>.
<P>Between this Platonic extreme and the Humean position which would deny
the given derivation <I>tout court</I>, we have the conventionalism of
Searle. For Searle, too, there are necessities obtaining in the sphere
of social acts. For him, however, these necessities follow from the special
character of those forms of behaviour which involve what he calls `constitutive
rules', rules whose adoption at a certain time by a certain culture or
society brings into being the corresponding categories or forms of behaviour.
<P>There are, Searle tells us, two different kinds of rules or conventions:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some rules regulate antecedently existing forms of behaviour.
For example, the rules of polite table behaviour regulate eating, but eating
exists independently of these rules. Some rules, on the other hand, do
not merely regulate an antecedently existing activity called playing chess;
they, as it were, create the possibility of or define that activity. The
activity of playing chess is constituted by action in accordance with these
rules. Chess has no existence apart from these rules. (1969a, p. 131)</BLOCKQUOTE>
The same can be said also, from Searle's point of view, of the institution
of promising:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The institutions of marriage, money, and promising are like
the institutions of baseball and chess in that they are systems of such
constitutive rules or conventions. (<I>loc. cit.)</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
Searle is appealing here to an opposition between `institutional' and `brute'
facts, the former being distinguished in this way: that they presuppose
deliberate constitutive arrangements of the given sort. Many forms of obligations,
commitments, rights and responsibilities are, Searle holds, a matter of
institutional facts in this sense. As for Reinach, so also for Searle,
the oughtness of obligation follows as a matter of necessity from the isness
which is the making of a promise. For Searle, however, this is a definitional
matter, for the making of a promise is for him by definition a case of
acting according to certain conventional rules and in these rules the notion
of obligation is involved in the relevant sense.
<P>There are on this view no special universal and uninventable categories
which our everyday acts of promising might reflect and by which the very
institution of promising might somehow be constrained and made intelligible.
The illusion that there are such categories arises only as a result of
the fact that, because certain parts of reality have themselves been shaped
by rules of the constitutive sort, we are able to utilize corresponding
concepts and to apply them to corresponding pieces of behaviour.
<P>There are clearly, however, as Searle himself must recognize, certain
constraints on the constitutive rules that human beings can adopt. Thus,
for example, we cannot have a rule which enjoins walking through walls,
or travelling back in time, or making 2 + 2 make 5. Institutions are in
this sense constrained by brute facts and also by the requirement of logical
consistency of the underlying rules. It seems that for Searle, however,
they cannot be constrained by anything other than this; for what could
this something else be? All conceivable constitutive rules which are factually
realizable and logically coherent must from his perspective be at least
<I>ex
ante</I> of exactly equal status, however absurd or unnatural they might
seem.
<P>Reinach, in contrast, has a means of doing justice not merely to the
necessary laws and necessary constraints governing the field of institutional
facts, but also to our capacity to grasp immediately the absurdity of institutional
arrangements which violate such constraints (as we can grasp immediately
the <I>a priori </I>absurdity of eating a phoneme or weighing a number).
He holds, as we have seen, that there is a family of uninventable and intrinsically
intelligible categories which serve as the necessary basis for rule-formation
in the institutional sphere. Thus there could not, according to Reinach,
arise institutions which did not reflect the basic categories of, for example,
utterance-phenomena, claims, obligations, and their interrelations.
<P>For Reinach promise and obligation are elements in a complex natural
hierarchy of universally instantiable categories. It is in reflection of
this autonomous hierarchy of categories that the relevant concepts and
the rules we follow in speaking and acting have in large part arisen. These
categories and their instantiations may involve (e.g.) linguistic elements,
but they are not contributed by language or convention. On the contrary,
<I>the
very practices involved in formulating and adopting conventional rules
presuppose universal categories of the given sorts</I>, not least those
universal categories which concern rules and conventions themselves and
all that goes together therewith. Clearly, on pain of circularity, we cannot
hold with Searle that such universal categories could themselves have been
invented via rules and conventions.
<P>Note that Reinach accepts that certain institutional conveniences may
in the course of history come to be attached to universal categories of
the given sorts as these are realized in particular societies. Thus he
is willing to concede to Searle that even a world which manifests the given
uninventable universal categories in the realm of social acts might still
have room for <I>purely conventional</I> arrangements built up on these,
reflecting constitutive rules of the sort Searle favours.<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)
</A></SUP>Cases
of concepts which are "purely conventional" in this sense might be: <I>endowment
mortgage</I>, <I>lien bond</I>, <I>football team-manager</I>, and so on.
These (we may reasonably suppose) correspond to no special universal categories,
but are rather imposed upon the world via constitutive rules in the way
that Searle describes. The criterion of pure conventionality here, a criterion
which Reinach, too, could readily accept, is the possibility of our introducing
the concepts in question via non-circular definitions expressible in terms
of concepts which are truly and unproblematically more basic. For Reinach,
however, we must by these means eventually arrive at <I>basic institutional
concepts</I>, which is to say: institutional concepts not capable of being
further defined on the institutional level.
<I>Ownership</I>, presumably,
is a concept of this sort; others might be:
<I>rule</I>, <I>obligation</I>,
<I>benefit</I>,
<I>exchange</I>, <I>utterance</I>,
<I>uptake</I>, <I>understanding</I>,
<I>agreement</I>, <I>preference</I>,
<I>sincerity</I>, and so on. Similar
basic institutional concepts are required also e.g. in the realm of games
- concepts such as
<I>winning</I>, <I>losing</I>,
<I>playing, breaking
a rule</I>, and so on. And clearly such basic institutional concepts, or
the corresponding natural categories, must be involved also where constitutive
rules are formulated and adopted in the realm of the positive law, concepts
such as <I>command,</I> <I>decision</I>, <I>authority</I>,
<I>consent,
acknowledgement, jurisdiction</I>, and so on.<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)
</A></SUP>Consider,
now, the truths holding of such basic institutional concepts. The question
for Searle is: are such truths <I>purely conventional</I> in the sense
defined above? Clearly not: for the very formulation and adoption of constitutive
rules <I>presupposes</I> concepts of the given sort. Are they, then, merely
analytic? This alternative, too, can be ruled out, by the argument given
above on the inapplicability of the analytic conception to relationships
of material necessity. Can we, then, suppose that all such concepts can
be defined in non-circular ways in terms of non-institutional concepts?
Not at all, for then all institutional concepts would turn out to be thus
definable, an outcome which Searle quite rightly rules out.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)
</A></SUP>The
only alternative which remains, therefore, is for Searle to accept that
the given truths express irreducible material necessities of the Reinachian
sort, that is, that they express necessary relations between certain uninventable
<I>sui generis</I> categories. That Searle has not faced the necessity
of drawing this conclusion follows from the fact that he has always already
<I>presupposed</I> a rule-positing society, without ever asking how this
society and its rule-positing practices came about - not, clearly, by prior
rules).
<P>Not only Reinach, then, but also Searle must accept the notion of basic
institutional concept. Moreover, both must accept also the irreducible
institutional categories to which such concepts must correspond. Where
they might still disagree is in relation to the question as to where the
line is to be drawn between what we have called purely conventional concepts
(concepts which can reasonably be held to have been introduced by definition)
and basic institutional concepts (concepts reflecting irreducible categories
for which non-circular definitions cannot be supplied). Promising, in particular,
is taken by Searle to be a purely conventional concept, where Reinach insists
that it is basic.<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21) </A></SUP>Such borderline disputes
need not detain us long, however, so long as it is accepted that we are
in possession of clear cases on either side of the disputed border. For
then it will at least have been established that there is an intrinsic
order of categories that is prior to any imposed order which we might seek
to contrive e.g. by definitional fiat. Recall, in this connection, the
reconstructive endeavours of Whitehead and Russell in <I>Principia Mathematica.
</I>Number,
in their framework is defined (though not before *100 of volume II) in
terms of certain other, not intuitively more basic concepts, including
<I>propositional
function</I> and <I>type.</I> That such a definition can be constructed
(albeit, notoriously, at a certain price in terms of other disputed assumptions
in the system) does not, from the Reinachian perspective, imply that numbers
<I>are</I> what they are reputed to be in the context of that system. Rather,
it shows that we have a certain free play in constructing definitional
systems adequate for example to our deductive purposes in mathematics.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B>A Theory of the A Priori</B>
<P>Let us summarize the results of our deliberations as far as the phenomenon
of <I>a priori </I>knowledge is concerned. Our thesis is as follows: that
<I>a
priori</I> knowledge relates first and foremost to the relations (above
all relations of necessitation) which obtain between intelligible categories
of for example colour, sound or shape. Man, it is suggested, is born with
an innate capacity to discriminate between instances of categories of the
given sorts for this is not itself something that could have been learned
and hand in hand with this innate capacity goes the ability to grasp the
associated relations of necessitation. One incidental advantage of the
view in question is that it yields a systematic accounting of all the various
types of <I>a priori</I> laws (laws relating to one-sided and mutual necessitation,
laws of exclusion and compatibility, and so on), where more familiar treatments
of the
<I>a priori</I> are constrained to conceive the latter as amounting
to little more than a collection of <I>ad hoc</I> examples. Our view amounts,
as already suggested, to an ontological (realist, reliabilist) theory of
the
<I>a priori</I>: we enjoy synthetic <I>a priori</I> knowledge of, say,
the basic relations between colours, because there are corresponding intrinsically
intelligible relational structures in the world. This view, once the common
possession of all philosophers, who rightly saw the existence of such structures
as providing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
of their discipline, is diametrically opposed not only to standard Humean
conceptions (which simply deny the existence of necessity <I>in re</I>),
but also to the Kantian view, which sees the <I>a priori</I> as a result
of the imposition of structure by experiencing subjects. Kant was, to be
sure, correct in recognizing the central importance of synthetic
<I>a priori
</I>knowledge
not only to philosophy but also to science and to our everyday experience.
He was wrong, however, not only in his estimation of the scope of such
knowledge which he saw as being restricted, effectively, to not much more
than arithmetic, geometry (Euclidean) and mechanics (Newtonian) but also,
and disastrously, in his account of where such knowledge comes from.

the work on logic and ontology of his teacher Edmund Husserl. It incorporated
also criticisms of Husserl's thinking derived from the Brentanian philosopher
of language Anton Marty and from Reinach's friend and fellow student in
Munich Johannes Daubert. On the pre-First World War Munich tradition of
speech act theory see Smith 1990 and Schuhmann and Smith 1985. An important

<P><A NAME="N_10_"></A>10.&nbsp; This question is not at this stage able
to be decided. We do know, however, that Austin's early interest in German
(and Austrian) philosophy was not confined to his work of translating Frege.
Moreover, it is known that a copy of Reinach's <I>Gesammelte Schriften</I>
was possessed by Austin's colleague Gilbert Ryle. This survives, with annotations,
in the library of Linacre College in Oxford.

the theory of dependence and independence as this applies to species.

pp. 19, 94, 102.
<P><A NAME="N_13_"></A>13.&nbsp; This universality manifests itself also
in the fact that we naturally tend to understand alien social orders in
terms of the same restricted class of basic notions (claim, obligation,
etc.), just as we tend naturally to see slightly irregular triangles and
squares in terms of the standard concepts of <I>triangle, square, </I>etc.
<P><A NAME="N_14_"></A>14.&nbsp; Claim and obligation are in this sense
comparable to the individual accidents of the tradition. They differ from
standard Aristotelian examples, however, in that they can have a multiplicity
of bearers; moreover, they are able to be passed on from one bearer to
another (claims and obligations can be inherited; they may migrate from
one substance to another). Here, therefore, we have to do not with an individual
necessary dependence of one entity upon another, but rather with what might
be called a <I>generic</I> dependence, whereby it is required only that
the dependent entity exist in association with some entity or other from
a certain restricted class. (See, again Smith, ed. 1982.)
<P><A NAME="N_15_"></A>15.&nbsp; The argument which follows is developed
at greater length in my 1986, pp. 15-18.
<P><A NAME="N_16_"></A>16.&nbsp; See my 1981 for further consideration
of the meaning of the terms `formal' and `material' in the present context.
<P><A NAME="N_17_"></A>17.&nbsp; This is no mere incidental mark of analyticity,
but a statement of what it is for a proposition to be analytic. There are,
to be sure, competing accounts as to what `analytic' might mean, drawn
for example from Wittgensteinian `logical grammar'. None of these accounts
has however succeeded in establishing itself as a clear and natural alternative
to the Fregean account adopted here.
<P><A NAME="N_18_"></A>18.&nbsp; Cf. Reinach 1913, pp. 801f., Eng. p. 104,
where the parallels between Reinach's notion of enactment and Searle's
notion of constitutive rule are especially clear. See also Paulson 1987
and Burkhardt 1986.
<P><A NAME="N_19_"></A>19.&nbsp; Note that nothing in what follows turns
on the question as to whether we have provided even partially adequate
lists of basic institutional concepts here: the lists provided in the text
are intended to serve as illustrative examples only.
<P><A NAME="N_20_"></A>20.&nbsp; 1969, p. 56.
<P><A NAME="N_21_"></A>21.&nbsp; Searle has indeed offered a definition
of "promising" in terms of other, more basic concepts (see his 1969, pp.
57ff.), though it has to be said e.g. in relation to clause 7. of this
definition that it is not at all clear that the mere fact that someone
intends that his utterance shall place him under an obligation to do such
and such is sufficient to bring it about that his utterance will indeed
have this effect. In regard to clause 9., similarly, we must ask whether
the semantical rules of a language really can be such that a given sentence
is correctly and sincerely uttered if and only if this sentence brings
it about that the speaker is brought under an obligation.
