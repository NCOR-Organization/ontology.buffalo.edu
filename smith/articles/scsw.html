<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Introduction</b>
<p>While contemporary philosophers have devoted vast amounts of attention
to the language we use in describing and finding our way about the world
of everyday experience, they have, with few exceptions, refused to see
this world itself as a fitting object of theoretical concern. In what follows
I shall seek to show how the commonsensical world might be treated ontologically
as an object of investigation in its own right. At the same time I shall
seek to establish how such a treatment might help us better philosophically
to understand the structures of both physical reality and cognition.
<p>My remarks are prompted by a number of important investigations which
have been carried out by non-philosophers in recent years. Thus for example
there is the project of a 'semiophysics' a physics of the salient structures
in reality that has recently been advanced by the French thinkers Ren&eacute;
Thom and Jean Petitot.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup> There are the
experiments of Gestalt psychologists such as Gaetano Kanizsa and Paolo
Bozzi demonstrating the existence of a <i>sui generis</i> organization
of the perceptual world, for example in respect of the categories of colour,
shape, motion and contour.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> There is the
work of J. J. Gibson and other ecological psychologists on perceptual salience,
and on the substances, surfaces, affordances, etc. of the common-sense
world.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup> There are the investigations of
E. Rosch and her associates on the role of prototypicality in our everyday
experience, and of F. C. Keil and others on the ways in which our experience
is structured via natural species-genus relations.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
And finally, and for our present purposes most importantly, there are experiments
in the field of artificial intelligence issuing in the construction of
models not only of the processes of common-sense reasoning but also of
commonsensical reality itself.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Common Sense and Artificial Intelligence</b>
<p>As computer scientists have been forced, by degrees, to acknowledge,
it is everyday knowledge that is hardest to convey to a computer. Such
knowledge is, however, of tremendous importance. For it seems on the face
of it that our commonsensical belief-systems enjoy not merely a remarkable
efficiency when it comes to solving the problems raised in our everyday
passage through the world, but also a no less remarkable adaptability,
a capacity to maintain themselves in functioning order from situation to
situation and from generation to generation, even in the face of sometimes
catastrophic changes in environmental and other conditions. A good deal
of effort has accordingly been invested in the construction of theories
not merely of our common-sense beliefs but also of different aspects of
that common-sense reality in which we live and move and work. One of the
goals of the present paper, now, is that of using ideas on common-sense
physics derived from artificial intelligence research as a preamble to
a philosophical account of the structures of commonsensical reality with
pretensions to the status of a theory.
<p>Consider, for example, the so-called 'qualitative physics' of Kleer
and Brown (1984). This seeks to predict and explain the behaviours of mechanisms
by providing algorithms for determining the patterns of activity of complex
devices from the generic behaviours of their components. The latter prove
capable of being reduced to a rather small number of basic types, enjoying
different but comparable realizations in highly disparate fields. (Conduits,
for example, may be used to convey air, water, electric current, information,
investment funds, and so on.) In relation to each type of constituent we
may then distinguish, again, a rather small number of stable basic states
(for example <i>on</i>/<i>off</i>, <i>leftward flow</i>/<i>rightward flow</i>),
separated by instantaneous thresholds of transition. We are then faced
not, as in standard physics, with unsurveyable quantitative continua, but
rather with small finite spaces of alternative states, each one of which
is perceptually easily distinguishable from its neighbours. Movements into
and out of each of the basic states can moreover be represented by means
of the equations of a qualitative differential calculus, within which
<center>
<p>p > 0, dp/dt > 0, d<sup>2</sup>p/dt<sup>2 </sup>= 0</center>

<p>for example, might represent a situation in which the pressure in a
given container is positive and increasing at a constant rate.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup>
<p>Or consider the attempt by Gardin, Meltzer and their students to develop
a science of naive physics via the consideration of analogical computer-representations
of everyday objects such as strings, rods, levers and pulleys. This is
achieved via the construction of two-dimensional graphic arrays whose constituents
are designed to exhibit patterns of behaviour which are acceptable as qualitatively
correct for entities of the given sorts.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>
Strings, for example, can be crudely modelled as one-dimensional aggregates
of molecules satisfying the following four constraints, which turn out
to be sufficient to give qualitatively correct behaviours in a range of
situations:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>1. Continuity: there is a fixed distance parameter (e.g. zero)
between each molecule and its neighbours.
<p>2. Flexibility: there is a fixed angle parameter, which is an upper
bound to the amount the line joining the centres of two neigbouring molecules
may rotate.
<p>3. Impenetrability: there is no intersection between the pixels of a
molecule with the pixel elements of environment objects.
<p>4. Sensitivity to external forces: forces like gravity, wind, or viscous
drag are stored in the data structure of each molecule.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p><br>The given approach proves itself to be of high generality. Thus
for example by adjusting the flexibility limit angle from 180 to 0 one
is able to simulate the behaviour of a rigid bar, and selecting angles
between these limits allows the simulation of rods with varying degrees
of flexibility.
<p>The constraints in question were discovered by means of trial-and-error
experiments on a computer terminal: in this way the capacity of human subjects
to recognize the qualitative rightness of a physical set-up governed by
a range of variable parameters is used as a research instrument in establishing
laws of naive physics. One is reminded here of experiments carried out
much earlier, and without the benefits of computer simulations, by Albert
Michotte (1946), experiments designed to demonstrate the ways in which
(and the conditions under which) things and events in nature are perceived
as standing to each other in relations (above all causal relations) of
various sorts. The experiments of Michotte and his associates were of course
carried out without the benefits of computer simulation. Thus Michotte
did not even glimpse the possibility of building up by these methods a
model of the entire world of everyday physical objects in interaction.
(It must, however, be hastily admitted that Gardin and his associates are
far removed from an outcome of this sort.)
<p>The work of Hobbs <i>et al. (</i>1988) investigates the ways in which
common-sense knowledge is used in understanding texts about mechanical
devices and their failures. The resultant 'common-sense metaphysics' amounts
to a theory of those core concepts (granularity, scales, time, space, force,
causality, change, etc.) which figure in virtually every region of inquiry.
Consider, for example, the family of concepts associated with the notion
of force. A material body can be said to be shape-invariant with respect
to a given force if, on application of that force, its shape remains the
same. The topological invariance of a body can be similarly defined. A
body will cease to be shape- and topology-invariant when forces beyond
certain threshold intensities (say d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>) are
applied (and note, again, that we have here in each case an example of
a basic state-transition of the sort mentioned above). In these terms one
can now define what it is for a material to be 'hard', 'flexible', 'malleable',
'ductile', 'elastic', 'brittle', 'fluid', etc.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup>
Thus for forces of strength d &lt; d<sub>1</sub> the material is <i>hard</i>;
for forces of strength d<sub>1</sub> &lt; d &lt; d<sub>2</sub> it is <i>flexible</i>,
and so on. Similar methods can be used to investigate the family of concepts
associated with the different varieties of causal connection between material
bodies. The
<i>attachment</i> of bodies, for example, can be defined by
the fact that when either moves so, too, does the other. Attachment in
this sense may be either <i>direct</i>, or <i>mediated</i> via paths of
causal connections, and in terms of these notions one can go on to define
further notions such as barrier, opening, penetration, and so on.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
<p>The naive physics of Patrick Hayes countenances a still more general
theory incorporating massively large-scale formalizations of common-sense
knowledge of a sort that is designed to yield a formal (first-order, axiomatic)
theory of the entire domain of commonsensical reality. The axioms of this
theory should be intuitively acceptable (this being decided here also in
part by introspective means). Naive physics should in this sense be 'intelligent'.
But it should also be 'naive' in the sense that it takes as one of its
starting points the relevant commonsensical beliefs of normal human beings.
<p>How, Hayes asks, could one construct a robot capable of finding its
way efficiently around, say, a salad bar? Such a robot would need to have
the capacity not merely to negotiate walls, doors, chairs, tables, and
people. It would need also to be able to lift and manipulate crockery and
cutlery, tomatoes, lettuce, and other bits, pieces and mixtures, to the
extent that in order to succeed in its efforts it would need to be in possession
of something approximating to a theory of the entire world of solids and
liquids.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup> A physics of the usual sort
is of no help to him here. This is first of all because the relevant computations,
if they are capable of being carried out at all on a standard physical
basis (and if the relevant input data could somehow be obtained), would
be by orders of magnitude too slow and too computationally expensive for
the task in hand. But standard physics is of no help also because its theories
seem not to address cuts through reality of the right sorts and dimensions,
so that, even if exact solutions to standard physical equations could be
derived, it would in general be impossible to extract therefrom the intuitive
information relevant to further action. Hayes, accordingly, sets himself
the task of laying down the axioms of a theory of just those properties
and relations which structure the domain of normal or average or typical
human experience for human beings do, after all, seem to have the capacity
to negotiate salad bars in ways which suggest that they have somehow solved
the problems of data-gathering and interpretation that here arise.
<p>Hayes' goal, as we said, is a complete theory of commonsensical reality.
Thus he is not willing to sacrifice the scope and detail of his theory
for the sake of hasty implementation in the form of running programs which
are as experience shows destined to collapse when the attempt is made to
extend them to cope with new domains of problems. His project is hereby
set in opposition to the small axiomatic theories of limited domains which
were characteristic of the 'toy worlds' approaches once customary in artificial
intelligence research. (It would be set in opposition also to the approach
of Gardin and Meltzer mentioned above.) Indeed Hayes argues that the axioms
of his theory would require of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>
predicates for complete expression. These predicates can, however, be divided
into various sub-clusters, representing tentatively and provisionally distinguishable
branches of the discipline which he has in his sights. Thus in particular
Hayes distinguishes sub-clusters of predicates relating to:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>- places and positions
<p>- spaces and objects
<p>- qualities and quantities
<p>- change and time
<p>- energy, effect and motion
<p>- composites and pieces of stuff.</blockquote>

<p><br>Consider, for example, that sub-cluster which relates to places
and positions. This might involve predicates coding notions such as: on,
in, at, path, inside, outside, wall, boundary, container, obstacle, barrier,
and so on (and note in passing the extent to which many of these notions
are alien to the sorts of representations we find in standard physics).
No one of the given notions as realized in Hayes' naive physics will be
capable of being reduced to or defined in terms of any of the others. An
adequate treatment of the predicate coding 'on', for example, would need
to tie this predicate axiomatically to predicates coding notions such as
friction, support, gravity, solidity, tension, load, pressure, and so on,
in addition to the purely geometrical component of this notion upon which
earlier research on toy worlds had normally concentrated. Moreover, each
of these predicates, too, could be treated adequately only by means of
axioms in which they are tied in non-trivial ways to some or all of the
others. The theory of naive physics must therefore, in Hayes' eyes, be
highly non-hierarchical, as contrasted with a system like Carnap's <i>Aufbau</i>
(or Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), where a very small number of primitive
notions suffices for the construction of the entire edifice of the theory.
The formal properties of non-hierarchical theories have, it seems, been
hardly investigated, and in this sense also we may be in the dark as to
the formal properties of everyday physical reality itself. There seem,
however, to be important similarities between theories of the given sort
and logical systems, such as those developed by Lesniewski, which allow
the use of so-called 'creative definitions'.<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>From Aristotle to Galileo</b>
<p>Whether Hobbs, Hayes <i>et al. </i>are correct in supposing that one
can arrive in this way at a computationally efficient theory of naive physics
capable of resolving problems of the sort faced in robotics, is not a question
I wish here to address. It seems, indeed, to be at this stage questionable
whether a <i>predictive</i> science of the more usual sort can be achieved
with these methods, for reasons to be set forth below.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>
This is, however, of little importance for our purposes, since current
work in naive physics is interesting and challenging already from a
<i>descriptive</i>
point of view, which is to say quite apart from any predictive or explanatory
concerns which might be associated with it. In this and also in other respects,
as we shall see, it echoes back to earlier forays in naive-physical theory
on the part of Aristotle and his pre-Galilean successors.
<p>Modern-day psychologists have indeed acknowledged the similarity between
many of our folk-physical beliefs and the ideas on motion and impetus developed
by thinkers such as Philoponus and Buridan still operating within a pre-Galilean
framework.<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup> Philosophers had traditionally
assumed, with Aristotle, that man is in a certain sense in harmony with
the world: the forms we find in our minds <i>are</i> the forms of things
we see. As Feyerabend puts it in his "Defence of Aristotle" (1978), Aristotle
does not seek deeper theories of what lies 'behind' or 'beyond appearances',
for to seek such theories would be to assume that the world is not as it
appears to be. Certainly there is room for error on the Aristotelian view.
This relates, however, to particular perceptions only; it leaves the general
features of perceptual knowledge untouched. Thus the Aristotelian or commonsensical
conception 'will never concede that it is false throughout. Error is a
<i>local
phenomenon</i>, it does not distort our <i>entire outlook</i>. Modern science,
on the other hand (and the Platonic and Democritian philosophies it absorbed)
postulated just such <i>global distortions</i>.' (Feyerabend 1978, p. 148)
<p>Recent psychological interest in naive physics has understandably tended
to concentrate on those quaint-seeming aspects of the Aristotelian/commonsensical
conception of the world which subsequent physics has shown to rest (<i>per
impossibile</i>, on Aristotle's view) on systematic error. That such systematic
error exists should not, however, blind us to the fact that the central
principles of the Aristotelian world-view have not in this way been exposed
by subsequent
<i>physics</i> as erroneous.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
Rather, to the extent that these central principles have been called into
question at all, they have been subverted by a <i>philosophy</i> which
would consign our commonsensical beliefs, <i>en bloc</i>, to the realm
of systematic error.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup> Truth, in this
way, comes to be confined at best to a reality that is 'beyond appearance',
and ontology, similarly, comes eventually to be confined to the mere repetition
of post-Galilean physics.
<p>Here, in contrast, we wish to establish in broad terms which portions
of the Aristotelian world-view can still properly be counted as true true
of a commonsensical reality whose relation to physical reality must then
of course be independently established. (This latter question does not,
be it noted, arise, where common-sense beliefs are treated from a purely
psychological perspective.) Thus we follow Moore in holding that the common-sense
view of the world 'is, in certain fundamental features, <i>wholly</i> true'.
(1959, p. 44.) Our job will be one of determining, in part under the inspiration
of modern naive-physical theory, precisely which fundamental features or
components of the common-sense view <i>are</i> wholly true. But it will
be one of determining also how the truths in question can be seen to be
compatible (after all) with the truths of physics.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Can there be a <i>Theory</i> of Naive Physics?</b>
<p>Not all of those who have invested philosophically in the idea of a
common-sense reality would embrace the idea that a <i>theory</i> of this
reality is possible in anything like the standard sense in which we have
theories in, say, physics or number theory. Indeed there are those who
would deny this very possibility even while emphasizing the autonomy of
commonsensical experience itself. As H. L. Dreyfus puts it, echoing ideas
to be found also, in different forms, in Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Wittgenstein:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>it just may be that the problem of finding a <i>theory</i>
of common-sense physics is insoluble because the domain has no theoretical
structure. By playing with all sorts of liquids and solids every day for
several years, a child may simply learn to discriminate prototypical cases
of solids, liquids, and so on and learn typical skilled responses to their
typical behavior in typical circumstances. (Dreyfus 1988, p. 33)</blockquote>

<p><br>The force of Dreyfus' argument here is, however, difficult to grasp;
for surely something similar could be said, too, for example of the ways
in which physics students learn 'typical skilled responses in typical circumstances'
as they find out how to manipulate physical and mathematical equations
and equipment in laboratories. Clearly this would not of itself sanction
a claim to the effect that physics does not exist as theory. Hence much
further argument would be needed to prove that our behaviourally relevant
knowledge can exist <i>only</i> in tacit form so that the idea of a naive
physics <i>made explicit</i> would be incoherent. (Something like this
seems to be suggested by Augustine's remarks on time in the <i>Confessions</i>.)
<p>One can, however, see ways in which it might be possible to put flesh
on Dreyfus' suggestions concerning the resistance to theory of common sense.
One might wish to argue that the appropriate theoretical account of how
humans function in and find their ways about this domain must be provided
not in terms of theoretical beliefs, but rather in terms of 'unintelligent'
processes on the sensorimotor level. One might, that is, hold that the
ways in which humans negotiate everyday obstacles are in their essence
blind or mechanical, to the extent that there is nothing like a <i>theory</i>
of the common-sense world present even implicitly in the corresponding
bodily processes.
<p>Even if we did not in any sense use a theory of common-sense physics
in our everyday motor activity, however, we might still be in possession
of such a theory on the level of belief. Indeed it seems clear that both
children and adults do have the capacity to utilize naive-physical knowledge
in abstract ways, which is to say independently of their engaging in the
practical solution of any specific motor problems. Moreover, it is difficult
to see how an account of commonsensical knowledge and action in terms of
servomechanisms and the like could leave room for any theoretical explanation
of our understanding of natural language; for such understanding (and indeed
the very possibility of natural language itself) seems to rest essentially
on a shared, systematic set of beliefs and judgments about the common-sense
world, beliefs and judgments which are after all themselves capable of
being formulated in natural-language terms.
<p>A less radical suggestion has recently been advanced by Stroll (1990),
in a somewhat different context, to the effect that the naive physicist
or psychologist should abandon the search for a 'holistic' theory of the
commonsensical domain and content himself instead, in Wittgensteinian spirit,
with context-sensitive descriptions of separate cases. Stroll's arguments
here recall Peripatetic criticisms of the 'abstractness' of Galileo, who
was accused by his contemporaries of having constantly disregarded the
single case in attempting to comprehend nature under general laws and principles.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
They recall also J. L. Austin's view in "A Plea for Excuses" to the effect
that common sense is so subtle that it calls for a close, piecemeal approach
allowing attention to nuance and detail, rather than an all-pervasive systematic
account.
<p>One problem for Stroll and his ilk, however, is that sizeable fragments
of explicit naive-physical theory have been already worked out, at different
times and in different fields. These are indeed in almost every case 'descriptive'
in the sense Stroll favours (thus for example in Aristotle's <i>Physics</i>,
or in Husserl's <i>Crisis</i>), but they are for all that holistic, at
least in the sense that they do not resolve themselves into disconnected
stories and <i>aper&ccedil;us</i> of the sort some Wittgensteinians favour.
Moreover, as we have seen, attempts at explanatory-predictive theories
along the lines ruled out by Stroll can be found in great quantities in
the literature of artificial intelligence. Such attempts have, it is true,
so far yielded little in the way of successful predictive engines which
could even come close to approximating some small fragment of human competence.
To suggest, in Strollian spirit, that the very practice of theorizing in
this sphere should be abandoned, however, is to lend credence to a counsel
of intellectual nihilism. Moreover, it is to foreclose on the possibility
that an adequate theory of commonsensical reality might be developed whose
very <i>failure</i> as an engine of prediction would throw illuminating
light on the nature of this reality itself. (We shall give reasons below
for supposing that an outcome of this sort is indeed to be expected.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Status of Naive Physics</b>
<p>I shall accordingly take it for granted in what follows that it is possible
to construct a theory of the commonsensical world of the sort that is canvassed
by recent practitioners of naive or qualitative physics. In coming to terms
with recent work in artificial intelligence, however, it is important to
note that practitioners in this and related fields typically embrace views
as to the status of the discipline of naive physics above all in respect
of its ontological commitments quite different from those to be canvassed
here. In fact there are three partially overlapping groups of alternative
views which can be distinguished, which we might refer to, respectively,
as the <i>pragmatic</i>, the <i>psychological</i> and the <i>ontological</i>
conceptions of naive-physical theory:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><i>1. The pragmatic conception of naive physics</i>. This sees
naive physics not as a matter of propositions <i>true of</i> some specific
domain of 'commonsensical reality', but rather as a collection of computationally
efficient rules of thumb. Naive physics might thereby be seen as a theory,
of sorts, but then it is a theory conceived in purely instrumental terms,
so that its putative object commonsensical reality itself would turn out
to be a sort of 'theoretical entity' possessed of no autonomous status
whatsoever.
<p><i>2. The psychological conception of naive physics.</i> Another set
of views might be classed loosely under the heading of psychological (one
might also say 'epistemological' or 'cognitive') interpretations of the
naive-physical discipline. These include, <i>inter alia</i>, conceptions
of naive physics as a matter of 'mental models'.<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>
Naive physics, on views of this sort, is indeed a <i>theory, </i>rather
than a merely pragmatically oriented collection of rules (or tacit habits)
of thumb. But it is not, like physics proper, a theory of some transcendent
domain. Rather, it is a sort of psychology in disguise; a science of the
beliefs human beings share as concerns their everyday environment. The
fact that some, at least, of these beliefs are false is of no consequence
for the discipline on this perspective, since true and false beliefs will
quite properly be treated as having equal psychological reality.
<p><i>3. The ontological conception of naive physics.</i> The third set
of views here distinguished sees naive physics as a theory in the limit
<i>true</i>
of a stable, well-delineated, precisely and naturally specifiable subject-matter
of its own, distinct from that of psychology, a subject-matter properly
deserving the title of 'common-sense world'. It was investigations of this
subject-matter which predominated among metaphysicians and natural philosophers
in the time before (and for some time after) Galileo. Here true and false
beliefs about the physical environment are clearly not of equal value.
Indeed the most important goal of naive physics on this conception is precisely
that of finding systematic means of filtering out, from the totality of
such beliefs, those which merit admission into the edifice of the theory.</blockquote>
<i>Ad 1</i>. The pragmatic conception, which predominates especially among
the practitioners of artificial intelligence research, will be of little
further concern. One not inconsiderable problem with the doctrine is that
it has the effect of inverting our usual intuitions in such a way that
tables, chairs, loaves of bread, and the like, are now to count as 'theoretical
entities'. Another problem is that, like all pragmatic doctrines, it tells
us at most part of the story. What it does not and can not tell us is <i>why</i>,
given two or more competing realizations of the naive-physical discipline,
it should be the case that one is more or less useful or effective than
the others. It is, again, a counsel of intellectual nihilism to deny the
possibility of and the necessity for deeper questions here, questions which
will yield reasons both for differing levels of intuitive adequacy and
for computational or predictive success or failure.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Ad 2</i>. Research in naive physics falls, on the psychological conception,
within the domain of experimental psychology as standardly conceived, or
within some neighbouring domain such as that of cognitive anthropology.
One can, for example, investigate the naive-physical beliefs of children
in light of the ways in which such beliefs come gradually to be modified
or corrected on exposure to the Newtonian world-view encapsulated in standard
physics textbooks.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup> Or one can investigate
the extent to which non-Newtonian beliefs about the physical world are
tacitly retained even by those adults who are otherwise able to demonstrate
a capacity to affirm the correct Newtonian principles.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>
<p>There is surely a sense in which investigations of these matters may
be useful and illuminating. One problem for us here, however, is that,
when once this psychological (anthropological, developmental) perspective
is taken seriously, it might appear difficult to justify talk in terms
of some one single discipline of naive physics at all. For there seems
to be a large number of different systems of naive-physical beliefs manifested
among different groups of human subjects at different times and places.
Not merely is there an opposition between children's and adult physics;
there seems to be a diversity in physical beliefs also as between different
cultures, to the extent that some have been led to conceive psychological
naive physics as collapsing into a structureless mass of belief-systems
manifesting limitless variety through time and space. Certainly if one
looks for evidence to support a view of this sort, given the wealth of
extant conceptions of the nature of reality in different cultures, one
will undoubtedly find it. Much valuable work has indeed been done, in the
area of what might be called 'ethnophysics', on the multiplicity of naive-physical
belief-systems that have arisen in the course of human, perhaps even of
animal, history.<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>
<p>It would be wrong, however, to assume as it were <i>a priori</i> that
there can be no constraints on such diversity. Thus one should not suppose
that wherever one has a systematic difference in behaviour one has therefore
also a difference in what ought properly to count as the naive physics
governing such behaviour. One may merely have a case of widespread error.
It seems for example that there is a widespread misconception, at least
among Americans, as to the workings of thermostats. This fact should not,
however, be taken to imply that those who hold false beliefs about thermostats
thereby manifest a non-standard naive-physical 'theory of heat', as for
example Kempton (1987) seems to hold. From our present perspective there
can be no common-sense theory about thermostats, any more than there can
be a common-sense theory of osmosis or radioactive decay. Thermostats are,
naively speaking, boxes which control the heat. Theories or popular prejudices
which go beyond this naive basis do not belong to common sense, and can
therefore lend no support to the idea that common sense is itself subject
to massive diversity in the relevant respect.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Ad 3. </i>It is the third (ontological) conception of naive physics
that will be defended here. Underlying this conception is the idea that
it is possible to formulate principles which will enable one, gradually,
to remove errors and other foreign matter from the class of those beliefs
that are relevant to the construction of a true naive-physical theory.
Such principles give us a means of coping with the supposed diversity among
folk-physical belief-systems, so that the common-sense world with which
the ontological conception operates would be, in the limit, independent
of variations in belief.
<p>A parallel intuition is defended by those for example the so-called
'Southern Fundamentalists'<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup> who give
credence to the idea that our everyday psychological beliefs, too, constitute
a <i>bona fide</i> system of truths. Indeed each of the physical issues
dealt with here seems to have an exact equivalent in the issues addressed
by philosophers and others under the heading of 'folk psychology'.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>
There, too, one finds a wide variety of beliefs that have been maintained
by human beings at different times and places. The existence of false beliefs
about the mind does not of itself, however, imply that it is impossible
to disengage therefrom some core of primary folk-psychological beliefs
beliefs which might be true and claim a truly scientific status.
<p>Similarly, I shall claim, the existence of more or less folksy physics
is not of itself a sufficient warrant for rejecting the idea of a (true)
naive physics more strictly conceived. Moreover if, as some hold, it is
a worthy project to attempt to prune away the more folksy bits of common-sense
psychology in order thereby to establish, as far as is possible, the laws
governing the mental domain of beliefs and desires, then it ought, surely,
to be a no less worthy project to attempt to prune away the more folksy
bits of common-sense physics in order to establish the laws governing that
domain of commonsensical things and events to which such beliefs and desires
primarily relate. The dominance of the psychological and epistemological
orientation among modern philosophers is indeed poignantly revealed in
the extent to which questions of the given sort have been taken seriously
as far as folk psychology is concerned, where their folk-physical counterparts
have been virtually ignored.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Naive Physics is True</b>
<p>The anthropologist Robin Horton has drawn what is for our purposes a
useful distinction between what he calls 'primary theory' and the different
sorts of 'secondary theories' which are, he argues, characteristic of different
economic and social settings.
<p>Primary theory or what we have been calling 'common sense' is, as Horton
points out, developed to different degrees by different peoples in its
coverage of different areas. In other respects, however, it differs hardly
at all from culture to culture. In the case of secondary or 'constructive'
theory, in contrast,
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>differences of emphasis and degree give place to startling differences
in kind as between community and community, culture and culture. For example,
the Western anthropologist brought up with a purely mechanistic view of
the world may find the spiritualistic worldview of an African community
alien in the extreme. (1982, p. 228)</blockquote>

<p><br>This agreement in primary theory has evolutionary roots:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>there is a sense in which such theory must 'correspond' to
at least certain aspects of the reality which it purports to represent.
If it did not so 'correspond', its users down the ages could scarcely have
survived. At the same time, its structure has a fairly obvius functional
relationship to specific human aims and to the specific human equipment
available for achieving them. In particular, it is well tailored to the
specific kind of handeye coordination characteristic of the human species
and to the associated manual technology which has formed the main support
of everyday life from the birth of the species down to the present day.
(op. cit., p. 232)</blockquote>
Where, then, from the perspective of survival, we can believe what we like
concerning micro-spirits and macro-devils residing on levels above or below
the levels of everyday concern, we have been constrained as far as the
broad physical structures of everyday reality are concerned, to believe
the truth otherwise we would not be here.<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup>
<p>It seems, indeed, to be the case that the commonsensical world is apprehended
in all cultures as embracing a plurality of enduring substances possessing
sensible qualities and undergoing changes (events and processes) of various
sorts, all existing independently of our knowledge and awareness and all
such as to constitute a single whole that is extended in space and time.
This body of belief is put to the test of constant use, and survives and
flourishes in very many different environments. No matter what sorts of
changes might occur in their surroundings, human beings seem to have the
ability to carve out for themselves, immediately and spontaneously, a haven
of commonsensical reality. Moreover, our common-sense beliefs are readily
translated from language to language and judgments expressing such beliefs
are marked by a widespread unforced agreement.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Common-Sense Theory and Physical Science</b>
<p>Ever more pressing, now, is our question as to the relation of naive
physics to physical science of the standard quantitative sort. Here, too,
a range of variant conceptions can be distinguished. At one extreme is
a view according to which commonsensical reality would itself be the only
reality there is, so that standard physics would have to be understood
in instrumental terms, as secondary to and derivative of the science of
commonsensical reality. (There are traces of this view in Husserl's <i>Crisis</i>
where we find also an important anticipation of Horton's ideas on primary
and secondary theory.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Between this and the opposite extreme position which sees naive physics
as simply false a position we have already had occasion to dismiss above
is a family of emergentist views, according to which both commonsensical
and standard physical reality are awarded an autonomous existence of their
own, the former being seen as a matter of higher-level stable features
of the latter. Such views parallel in some respects the view of minds as
higher-level features of brains that has been defended most recently by
Searle. Just as mind is, in Searle's terms, 'caused by . . . and realized
in' certain portions of physical reality,<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup>
namely in the operations and structure of the human brain, so commonsensical
reality would be caused by and realized in that portion of physical reality
which constitutes our external environment. Both mind and commonsensical
reality are from this point of view perfectly autonomous objects of theoretical
concern; both, however, are such that there are limits on the sorts of
theory which they are able to support. Above all, as we shall see, commonsensical
reality is not able to support the sort of predictive theory which we enjoy
in regard to cuts through physical reality at certain lower levels.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Physics of the Common-sense World</b><sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup>
<p>How, then, are we to select from the totality of structures of the physical
world those precisely relevant to the level of naive physics as here conceived?
We draw attention, first of all, to the ubiquitous role of sensible qualities
in filling out the world of commonsensical experience. The sensible qualities
of objects can in every case be identified with the properties of certain
corresponding <i>physical variations</i>. Thus colours, for example, can
be identified with surface spectral reflectances,<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>
the qualities of hot and cold with certain properties of the movements
of molecules, and so on. Only some types of physical variation are able
to support phenomena of the qualitative sort. Simple mechanical systems
(pendulums, for example) fall out of court in this regard, even though
they may <i>cause</i> properly qualitative variation in other media (for
example in the air molecules which they set in motion). How, then, are
we to focus in on variations of the relevant sort? Here the key idea, which
has been set out in greater detail in the papers by Petitot referred to
in the list of references below, is due to Ren&eacute; Thom. How can physical
theories be enriched sufficiently to capture in scientific fashion the
features specific to qualitative reality? The ground of a solution lies
already in the fact that physics, for all that it is restricted to the
quantitative, does indeed deal with the phenomena from out of which the
qualitative world is composed. What it does not do is to deal with those
specific ways in which these phenomena are composed or knitted together
or are delineated from each other that are relevant to the world of our
qualitative experience. It is in showing how to fill this gap that Thom's
achievement lies.
<p>Whatever appears, appears in the context of a spatio-temporally extended
whole. There is, in other words, a relation of foundation or existential
dependence between sensible qualities and spatio-temporal extension (no
colour can, as a matter of necessity, exist without spatial extension,
no sound without duration, etc.).<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup> The
perceived qualities of a black and brown spotted dog, for example, have
a certain spatial extension. The qualities distributed across any given
extension are in addition either fused together phenomenally, in the sense
that there is no observable separation between them (as when for example
there is a smooth transition from one colour to another); or they are phenomenally
'separated'. In the former case the underlying physical variation is continuous,
in the latter case it manifests a certain sort of discontinuity.
<p>Note that in the case of the spotted dog there is from our present perspective
no intrinsic difference between the separation or apparent contour which
corresponds to the perceived exterior of the dog and the separation which
occurs at those perceived interior boundaries where spots are set apart
from their surroundings. Indeed it seems clear in relation to either sort
of case that a sensible phenomenon is set into relief in relation to other
phenomena precisely where a discontinuity has been created by the qualitative
moments which fill its extension. It is
<i>separation</i>, in other words,
which accounts for <i>salience</i>.
<p>In giving an appropriate mathematical expression to this idea we suppose,
with Thom and Petitot, that W is the spatio-temporal extension of a given
phenomenon. As a portion of space-time, W is a topological space with the
usual topology. Suppose further that the different qualities which fill
W are expressed by degrees of <i>n</i> distinct intensive magnitudes q<sub>1</sub>,
q<sub>2</sub>, . . . , q<sub>n</sub>, each a function of points w&nbsp;
W. The q<sub>i</sub>(w) are then sensible qualities (colour, texture, temperature,
reflectance, etc.), but considered physically,<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup>
as immanent to the objects themselves and as associated with a certain
possibility of measuring.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup>
<p>A point w is called <i>regular</i> if all the q<sub>i</sub>(w) are continuous
in a neighbourhood of w. Let R be the set of regular points of W. R contains
a neighbourhood of every one of its points, and hence it is an open set
of W. Let K be the complementary set of R relative to W. K is the closed
set of what we can call the non-regular or <i>singular</i> points of W.
Clearly, w is a singular point if and only if there is at least one quality
q<sub>i</sub> which is discontinuous at w. We shall call K the
<i>morphology</i>
of the phenomenon that fills W. We shall now argue that K is the system
of qualitative discontinuities which sets this phenomenon into relief and
makes it salient as a phenomenon. (Consider, for example, the morphological
organization of a leaf, of a crack in a window-pane, of a dog, or of a
photograph of a dog.)
<p>In order to accord physical content to this definition, we must find
some way to conceive a morphology K as a matter of physical properties
internal to whatever underlies or causes the phenomenon in question. Condensing
a lot of physical detail into a small space, we can say that the instantaneous
states of a physical system <i>qua</i> physical are, when taken individually,
<i>transient</i>:
they are too fleeting to be observable. There are however circumstances
in which there arise effectively observable states of a system: this occurs
for example where trajectories manifest asymptotic behaviour, or where
there is sufficiently rapid oscillation between one stable endpoint and
another. Such effectively observable states, the states into which the
system repeatedly falls, or into which it tends to fall, are for obvious
reasons called the <i>attractors</i> of the system. Consider, for example,
an oscillating electric circuit. From any initial state the system after
some time reaches the stable oscillatory state and so its trajectory is
attracted by this state.
<p>Return, now, to our phenomenon of the spotted dog having substrate S,
spatio-temporal extension W and morphology K. Choose a non-singular w W.
The internal state of the substrate S at w can be physically described
in terms of some attractor A<sub>w</sub> of some 'internal' dynamics. And
the q<sub>i</sub>(w) are intensive quantities associated with A<sub>w</sub>.
To explain the qualitative discontinuities of the q<sub>i</sub>(w), we
now let w<sub>o</sub> K be some singular point within W. In moving through
points w W the attractor A<sub>w</sub> becomes unstable when we cross w<sub>o</sub>
and is replaced by another attractor B<sub>w</sub>. Similarly when we cross
the exterior apparent contours of things the attractor A<sub>w</sub> disappears
entirely. Note, in all of this, that the behaviour of the underlying physical
system (the relevant variations themselves) are unobservable. What we experience
as salient, and what we possess words in natural language to describe,
is the qualitative discontinuity which is the phase transition.
<p>One incidental outcome of this account is that, exactly in keeping with
the common-sense perspective outlined above, it removes the justification
from Locke's thesis to the effect that the secondary qualities of things
are inherently subjective. Certainly there is a distinction between the
physical structures which are, respectively, the primary and secondary
qualities of things given in experience.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup>
This distinction does not, however, lie in any supposed 'subjectivity'
of the latter, as Locke and many others have believed.<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup>
Rather, it lies in the fact that secondary qualities are not of interest
from the point of view of physical theory because they do not play any
important role in the causal structure of the world independent of their
role in perception. They reflect delineations in physical reality of a
kind whose interest depends essentially on the existence of a certain perceptual
apparatus on the part of human perceivers. They are not, though, dependent
on specific perceptions or beliefs (nor, <i>a fortiori</i> on our languages
or theories). As Hilbert writes:
<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>All that is necessary for the objectivity of a property is that objects
have or fail to have that property independently of their interactions
with perceiving subjects. Color is objective in so far as the colors of
objects do not depend on how they appear to observers, or even whether
or not there are any observers . . . Although reflectance is an objective
property in this sense and is physically well understood, it is not reducible
to more fundamental physical properties. (1987, p. 120f.).</blockquote>

<p><br>Note that one incidental implication of the thesis that naive physics
is true, is that the world of commonsensical reality will turn out to exist
independently of human experience: palaeontology and other related disciplines
do after all describe the common-sense world as it was before there were
people. Of course this world would not be interesting if there were no
people, and so these disciplines, too, would not exist. But what the disciplines
describe is, nevertheless, such as to
<i>exist</i> independently of human
beings.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A Theory of the Common-sense World</b>
<p>Our goal is that of providing a sound theory of that autonomous domain
which most properly deserves the name of 'commonsensical reality'. Our
ontology of qualitative reality can be taken only as a first step along
this road. On the one hand the realm of qualitative reality is too wide,
since it extends beyond the domain of commonsensical experience, for example
in including colour-like qualitative structures outside the domain of what
human sensory organs can detect. To correct the qualitative ontology we
need to turn to the psychology of sensation in order to establish the limits
of qualitative structures graspable by the human sensory system. On the
other hand our account is too narrow, since it fails to do justice to those
dimensions of ontological form which are embraced by the world of commonsensical
experience but which are skew to the strictly qualitative sphere. Thus
there remains the task of supplementing the qualitative ontology with a
theory of such commonsensical categories as those of substance, of change
or process, of typicality, species and categorization, of places and times,
and so on. As in our account of the qualitative ontology, so also here,
what matters are certain sorts of perceptually detectable (salient) boundaries
which are present in the underlying physical reality, boundaries which
are not addressed in quantitative physical theory. The doctrine of emergence
that is hereby implied is accordingly one of the emergence not of <i>things</i>
but of <i>boundaries</i> or <i>contours.</i>
<p>From the work of Thom and Petitot we already know enough about the theory
that will result hereby to know that it will have a power of prediction
that is imperfect as compared to that of physics proper. Naive physics
seeks only to fix the repertoire of qualitative and structural forms involving
substance, accident, change, etc. which make up the world of everyday experience.
And then it turns out that there is a restricted number of such forms into
which the behaviours of complex systems can typically fit. What it cannot
do is tell us when or where this or that form will come to be instantiated.
For unlike standard physics, which applies, in its fashion, to everything,
and therefore (if at certain restricted granularities only) leaves no predictive-explanatory
gaps, naive physics deals with a narrow range of phenomena the explanation-prediction
of which must in almost every case involve phenomena outside this narrow
range. This makes it highly doubtful whether naive physics could ever serve
the needs of artificial intelligence research for example in the sphere
of robotics and elsewhere. Nonetheless, however, it is with the help of
true naive-physical beliefs that human beings are able to find their stumbling
way around the world, just as it is with the help of naive psychological
beliefs that they are able to make normally reliable predictions about
the actions of their fellows.

Petitot, H. Philipse and J. Seifert for helpful comments.
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a>2. 2. See especially Thom 1988, Petitot 1985.
<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a>3. 3. See Kanizsa 1979 and Bozzi 1958, etc.
<p><a NAME="N_4_"></a>4. 4. Cf. Gibson 1979 and also Stroll 1988, in which
the ontology of surfaces, conceived on broadly Gibsonian lines, is for
the first time worked out in detail.
<p><a NAME="N_5_"></a>5. 5. Cf. Rosch <i>et al</i>. 1976, Keil 1979.

1986, Weld and Kleer, eds., 1989.
<p><a NAME="N_7_"></a>7. 7. Cf. Gardin and Meltzer 1989.
<p><a NAME="N_8_"></a>8. 8. Gravity, for example, is stored as a tendency
for an element to move in a certain direction by a distance that is determined
by a parameter coding the intensity of the force applied. See Gardin and
Meltzer 1989, p. 143, citing Gambardella 1985.
<p><a NAME="N_9_"></a>9. 9. Hobbs, <i>et al</i>.; Hager 1985.
<p><a NAME="N_10_"></a>10. 10. Hobbs, <i>et al.</i>
<p><a NAME="N_11_"></a>11. 11. I ignore, here, the considerable technical
difficulties which would have to be overcome in order to construct the
necessary hardware.
<p><a NAME="N_12_"></a>12. 12. See Rickey 1975.
<p><a NAME="N_13_"></a>13. 13. See also McDermott 1990, who rightly criticizes
Hayes' 'logicist' assumption to the effect that it is by means of deductions
from axioms that we use naive physics to find our way around the world.
There are other central aspects of Hayes' work to which one could object.
Thus for example the account of the ontology of liquids presented in Hayes
1985a is flawed in virtue of the fact that it rests essentially on the
highly non-commonsensical (Quine-inspired) trick of reducing objects to
four-dimensional histories. As R. Casati has shown in as yet unpublished
papers, this leads to highly counter-commonsensical consequences.
<p><a NAME="N_14_"></a>14. 14. See especially the papers by Bozzi listed
below, and more recently also e.g. McCloskey 1983a, Holland, <i>et al.</i>
1986, p. 208.
<p><a NAME="N_15_"></a>15. 15. Thus Aristotle was perfectly clear, for
example, that solid bodies will fall towards the centre of the earth if
not impeded in their fall.
<p><a NAME="N_16_"></a>16. 16. Thus for example the corpuscular philosophers
held that the majority of our ordinary perceptual judgments 'must be <u>literally
false</u>, because the redness or the warmth we think we perceive are not
really the qualities or states of material things we take them commonly
to be.' (Cf. Philipse 1989, p. 143.)
<p><a NAME="N_17_"></a>17. 17. Cf. Bozzi, 1958, p. 2f. of translation.
<p><a NAME="N_18_"></a>18. 18. See e.g. Gentner and Stevens, eds. 1983.
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a>19. 19. See e.g. Shanon 1976, Peters 1982, Clement
1982, DiSessa 1982, Kaiser, Jonides and Alexander 1986, Roncato and Rumiati
1986.
<p><a NAME="N_20_"></a>20. 20. As McCloskey puts it in regard to the 'remarkably
well-articulated na&iuml;ve theories of motion' people develop on the basis
of their everyday experience:
<p>theories developed by different individuals are best described as different
forms of the same basic theory. Although this basic theory appears to be
a reasonable outcome of experience with real-world motion, it is strikingly
inconsistent with the fundamental principles of classical physics. In fact,
the naive theory is remarkably similar to a pre-Newtonian theory popular
in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries. (1983, p. 299)
<p>See also p. 318 on the remarkable persistence of folk theory in the
face of formal physics training, as well as McCloskey 1983a, McCloskey
<i>et
al</i>. 1980, and Forguson 1989.
<p><a NAME="N_21_"></a>21. 21. K&ouml;hler's 1921 is to no small part devoted
to the naive physics of chimpanzees. K&ouml;hler argues above all that
there is practically no <i>statics</i> in the chimpanzee, and he notes
that something similar holds, too, of very young children. See also Lipmann
and Bogen (1923), an experimental study of human naive physics by students
of K&ouml;hler in Berlin.
<p><a NAME="N_22_"></a>22. 22. Cf. Graham and Horgan 1988. See also Forguson
1989 on 'rational psychology'.
<p><a NAME="N_23_"></a>23. 23. This is clearly brought out in D'Andrade
1987, which incidentally reveals also the remarkable similarity between
folk-psychological models and the work of traditional philosophers on the
structures of mind.
<p><a NAME="N_24_"></a>24. 24. We cannot, however, use the theory of evolution
to provide a proof of common sense. For this theory, like all developed
scientific theories, rests on evidence whose interpretation itself presupposed
the truth of common sense.
<p><a NAME="N_25_"></a>25. 25. Searle 1983, p. 265. Note, however, that
the precise meaning of phrases like 'realized in' remains in need of detailed
elucidation, elucidation which Searle himself seems not to see the necessity
of providing.
<p><a NAME="N_26_"></a>26. 26. The ideas in this section are due to Jean
Petitot.
<p><a NAME="N_27_"></a>27. 27. Hilbert 1987.
<p><a NAME="N_28_"></a>28. 28. See the papers collected in Smith, ed.,
1982, and also Husserl's third Logical Investigation.
<p><a NAME="N_29_"></a>29. 29. Certain simplifications are involved here.
Thus there is no single property of surface spectral reflectance, which
is a macroscopic approximation of a more fine-grained system on the quantum
level of a range of properties having to do with the emission-absorption
spectra of the atoms constituting the substrate.
<p><a NAME="N_30_"></a>30. 30. Note that, since colour is dissective only
to a certain extent, one should strictly speaking speak of colour not at
a point but over an interval; this adjustment does not affect the validity
of the account put forward in the text however.
<p><a NAME="N_31_"></a>31. 31. On the nature of these differences, and
on the manifold varieties of secondary qualities in general, see Witschel
1961 which summarizes Husserl's position.
<p><a NAME="N_32_"></a>32. 32. Note that this account, which is derived
from Hilbert 1987, is distinct from that of Thom/Petitot, which sees colours
is being merely associated with certain underlying physical qualities,
not as identical therewith.</blockquote>
