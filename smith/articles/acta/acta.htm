<P>&sect; 1. Preamble

<P>It will be the thesis of this paper that there are among our mental
acts some which fall into the category of <U>real material relations</U>.
That is: some acts are necessarily such as to involve a plurality of objects
as their relata or fundamenta. Suppose Bruno walks into his study and sees
a cat. To describe the seeing, here, as a relation, is to affirm that it
serves somehow to tie Bruno to the cat. Bruno's act of seeing, unlike his
feeling depressed, his putative thinking-about-Santa-Claus or his musing,
abstractedly, about the tallest spy, has at least two fundamenta: it is,
as a matter of necessity, dependent for its existence upon both Bruno himself
and the cat that he sees.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>This idea will naturally raise echoes of Russell's doctrine of knowledge
by acquaintance. 'I am <U>acquainted</U> with an object', Russell tells
us, 'when I have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i. e. when
I am directly aware of the object itself' (1918, p. 209). And indeed a
distinction in many ways like that between acquaintance and description
will find a place within the theory here projected, but there are crucial
differences.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Firstly, Russell's notion of cognitive relatedness is epistemological:
I am related by acquaintance to an object, on the Russellian account, when
I have a certain type of indefeasible or infallible knowledge of that object.
Hence Russell's view that only sense data, universals and our own selves
- objects which can in some sense occur <U>in</U> our thoughts - can be
objects of acquaintance. Here, on the other hand, a naturalistic thesis
will be defended to the effect that we may be related through mental experience,
<U>inter alia</U>, to ordinary material objects, and this will rule out
a purely epistemological approach to the problem at hand (will rule out
the idea that there can be an epistemological <U>criterion</U> of cognitive
relatedness).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Secondly, it is for Russell a certain <U>universal</U>, the relation
of acquaintance, which serves to tie the subject to his object, generating
an awkward commitment to hybrid relational complexes comprising both particulars
and universals somehow fused together within a single whole. Here, in contrast,
it is to be <U>particulars</U> (particular relational acts) which tie the
subject to his object, and this is a move which holds out the promise that
we shall be able to lend some descriptive content to the idea of a 'direct
cognitive relation': mental acts are, after all, items with which we have
some independent familiarity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&sect; 2. Methodological Solipsism
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The ideas to be outlined here are in this respect closer in spirit
to the Brentano-Husserl tradition, which has consistently emphasised the
relation-like character of acts as particular existents. As is well known,
however, Brentano and his successors held back from conceiving acts as
relations linking subjects to the <U>transcendent</U> world in the face
of what seemed to them to be the obvious problem raised by non-veridical
acts, such as hallucinations, which lack independently existing objects.
Since a relation cannot link what exists to what does not exist, it was
held either that acts could not be relational at all, that they could possess
only something approximating to relationality in this or that respect,
or that an act consists in a relation merely to some epistemological middleman,
not to any independently existing object.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Yet to draw such conclusions from the existence of hallucinations,
etc., is to presuppose that an adequate account of the structure of acts
must conceive all acts as constituting a homogeneous totality. Two distinct
elements seem to be involved in this presupposition. On the one hand it
is taken to be a mark of an elegant theory of acts that it should treat
all acts as realisations of a single structural frame. On the other hand
it is assumed that an adequate theory can recognise only those differences
among acts which are transparent to their subjects. Since differences like
that between veridicality and non- veridicality are not marked in present
consciousness, they are held to reflect nothing intrinsic to the structures
of acts themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Both elements have been accepted as a matter of course, not only by
the members of the Brentano tradition, but also within empirical cognitive
science. A range of standard options as to the nature of mental experience
has grown up, each adopting one or other variant of the position that even
a veridical act may manifest no more than a contingent association with
the transcendent object toward which it is directed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Thus there is the view according to which an object-directed act has
the structure of an inner description. Such an act is veridical, on this
view, if there is some transcendent object which satisfies it - in just
the sense of 'satisfaction' with which we are familiar in semantics. That
there exists such an object is clearly a matter incidental to the act as
such (as the existence of an appropriate referent is incidental to a term
as such): an identical act-cum-description might equally well, in different
circumstances, have been non-veridical. <SUP><A HREF="#N_1_">(1)</A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Alternatively, the outward-pointing nature of an act
may be identified with its directedness towards sense-data, or sense- data-like
phenomena presented in imagination or in memory. Objects other than sense-data
may thereby <U>exist</U>, but they cannot serve as immediate objects of
experience. They are relegated to the status of hypothetical posits somehow
behind or beyond the sense-data. This account (which is very like Brentano's,
though it may be reformulated in the terms of a doctrine of logical constructions)
yields two notions of veridicality. On the one hand an act is what we might
call phenomenally veridical if its purported sense-datum exists.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_">(2)</A></SUP>
All phenomenally veridical acts may then perhaps be conceived as <U>real
relations</U> in a sense close to that expounded in this essay. But they
are not relations reaching out to the transcendent material objects of
ordinary experience. On the other hand an act is what might be called strictly
veridical if the object which it posits, or which is posited in associated
acts of judgment, does in fact exist, as it were <U>per accidens</U>, in
transcendent reality. And this character of strict veridicality reflects
nothing intrinsic to the act itself.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">Or, finally, consider Husserl's philosophy of the noema
as this is resurrected, for example, in Dennett's idea of a 'notional world'.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">(3)</A></SUP>
This sees the intentionality of an act of presentation as residing in its
directedness toward an <U>immanent or intentional object</U>, its veridicality
in the correspondence of this object with some independently existing transcendent
object. Here we have a conception of <U>all</U> object-giving acts as relations
(tying subjects to their own intentional constructs), and we have once
more a conception of veridicality or transcendent reference as something
incidental to the act itself.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&sect; 3. The Causal Theory</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">On each of the above accounts the act is confined, structurally,
to the immanent sphere, whether this be conceived in phenomenological or
neurological terms or in some other way. Each is committed to the classically
Cartesian thesis that we could in principle have exactly the same thoughts
even though all transcendent objects of our thoughts did not exist. Here,
however, I am concerned to develop the bare bones of a conception of the
mental which is consistent with naturalistic realism, broadly conceived,
i. e. with a view according to which (a) the world exists more or less
as it is given to us in those of our mental acts which are externally directed,
and (b) we are in normal circumstances directly acquainted with the objects
of these acts. The given acts would not have been there, had their objects
not existed; on the other hand the objects themselves typically existed
long before any acts were directed towards them.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">It has, naturally, been assumed by many that the needs
of naturalism may be met by an appeal to the <U>causal</U> interconnection
between the subject (organism) and his surroundings, by a view according
to which acts are related to objects only in the derivative sense that
the latter causally bring about certain specific sorts of changes in the
neurophysiological underpinnings of the former. The most obvious objection
to views of this sort is that they can deal at best only with our mental
experience of spatio-temporal objects in the material world. Part of what
is involved in this objection is here left aside: I take it for granted
that our cognitive access to <U>abstracta</U> (e. g. to universals, or
to the objects of mathematics) is in some sense, more precisely to be determined,
parasitic upon our experience of concreta, and that it is with the latter
that any workable account of the structures of experience must begin. But
the given objection has also a more serious aspect. It points to the fact
that causal theories of mental experience tend illegitimately to restrict
the range of target objects of experience to material (physical) objects
occupying determinate (compact?) regions of space, objects that are straightfowardly
eligible to stand in causal relations. Thus they exclude other varieties
of object: mental acts themselves, character traits, expressions of emotions,
cultural and institutional objects such as articles in philosophy journals,
bank balances, universities, etc., etc., all of which may reasonably be
counted as objects with which, in certain of our mental acts, we may have
direct relational contact.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">A second, no less important objection to the causal theory
turns on its assumption that we can enjoy in our mental experience only
an <U>indirect</U> contact with material reality. To see what is harmful
in this assumption suppose it really is the case that the immediate connection
between mental experiences and transcendent objects is effected <U>exclusively</U>
in causal terms, that mental activity does not enjoy any direct contact
of its own with objects in the material world, but can only (for example)
simulate, within causally established constraints, an intentional or notional
world which must somehow stand in for what lies on the outside. Clearly
there could be nothing, under these conditions, which could prevent the
world as represented in mental experience from being systematically skew
to the world as it is in itself; and there is no way in which this kind
of (Kantian) conclusion can be made consistent with naturalistic realism.
For the realist must surely insist that the intermeshing of experience
and reality is not merely a matter of accident, or magic, but rather that
it is guaranteed (in a non-Kantian way) by the very structure of our experience.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The causal theory has in addition provided no details
of mechanisms by which sheer causal interaction might institute and sustain
transcendent reference - other than those resting on intuitions independently
derived from folk semantics. The hope has been that this problem may be
overcome with the further development of the psychological and non-psychological
sciences. The suggestion to be advanced here, however, is that theoretical
progress may be facilitated by abandoning the (simple) causal theory in
favour of a conception of (some) mental acts as <U>sui generis</U> cognitive
relations. As Kim points out in his criticism of the Kripkean variety of
the simple causal theory of proper names: 'To name an object you must be
in some sort of <U>cognitive</U> touch with <U>it</U>. ' It is impossible
to explain, on the basis of a theory like Kripke's, how baptismal acts
reach their objects; how they get connected up with things ostensibly named;
how we may be related in a given act to, for example, a particular spoon-
handle, rather than the whole spoon, or the aggregate of molecules in the
spoon, or that side or surface of the spoon that is momentarily visible;
how it is (Evans, 1973) that a person's use of a shared name, when he has
had causal contact with both objects concerned, links up with one rather
than the other in a certain context. We shall see that the commitment to
cognitive relations does not deny the importance of causality to a full
understanding of the interconnections between world and subject. Naturalistic
realism teaches that it is mistaken to ignore the causal involvement of
organism and environment. But not just any old causal involvement of subject
and environment will do, it seems, if objective reference is to be secured.
Such involvement must be delimited and articulated - and in precisely the
ways with which we are familiar, at least obliquely, in our ordinary mental
experience. The structures we shall need to consider will therefore involve
a certain sort of mutual interdependence of causal and cognitive moments
and the trick will be to do justice to both, without reducing one to the
other.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">&sect; 4. Mental Acts <U>De Re</U></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">The idea of cognitive relatedness finds some support in
the recent work on <U>de re</U> belief, <U>de re</U> intentionality and
the like, where the presuppositions at the heart of post-Brentanian methodologically
solipsistic philosophy of mind are beginning to be called into question.
But <U>de re</U> mental attitudes have unfortunately been considered almost
exclusively from the point of view of semantics: attention has been devoted
to the logic of sentences expressing or reporting cognitive relatedness
or to the meanings of indexical expressions - at the expense of discussions
of the ontology of the cognitive relation or of the structures of indexical
acts.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">This is particularly clear from Woodfield's collection
<U>Thought and Object</U>, a sample of recent work on <U>de re</U> mental
attitudes (though our general complaint does not apply to Woodfield's own
brief but excellent statement of the issues in his Foreword to the volume).
It is clear also from various writings of e. g. Fllesdal, Woodruff Smith,
McIntyre, and, in a different vein, Mohanty, in which attempts are made
to formulate a doctrine of <U>de re</U> intentionality on the basis of
Husserl's philosophy of the noema and of Husserl's account in the LU (I
&sect; 26, VI &sect; 5) of the meanings of occasional expressions - though
it is difficult to see how the qualities of directness or definiteness
which they discuss could serve as anything more than distant analogues
of a true cognitive relatedness, since they allow that the relevant object
may not exist, i. e. - and more precisely - that there need be no relevant
<U>res</U>, and yet an act could still be <U>de</U> it. (Woodruff Smith
and McIntyre, 1982, <U>passim</U>. )</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">One further strand of thought on the issue of <U>de re</U>
mental attitudes is that canvassed by Chisholm (<U>op. cit.</U>, ch. 9),
a continuation of the Russellian, epistemological approach. Here again
a central role is played by the notion of indexicality, though an indexicality
that is effectively restricted, for epistemological reasons, to self-directed
acts. The remarks set forth below may indeed illuminatingly be conceived
as an attempt to provide working materials for an ontological approach
to the problems raised by (non-self-directed) indexical acts - in contrast
to the semantic and epistemological approaches that have hitherto predominated.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">&sect; 5. Varieties of Intentionality</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The thesis that our acts themselves may serve to tie
us to material objects in the world cannot, certainly, be defended as an
account of every act, not even of every veridical act. It will be possible
to claim only that relationality is a characteristic of a restricted sub-class
of veridical acts belonging, for each given individual, to what may be
recognised from the outside, by suitably qualified observers, as a central
or arterial core of his experiences. Acts external to this core, if they
are directed towards objects in transcendent reality at all, will typically
depend for their directedness (for their quality of pointing beyond themselves)
upon the substrate of connections that is established by this central core.
Thus for example I may direct myself to an object by description, as 'the
owner of this ele phant' or 'the initiator of that explosion' in virtue
of the fact that elephant and explosion are objects with which I am in
rela tional contact. Only in the rarest of cases ('the tallest spy') will
I be directed to a transcendent object in a descriptional act independently
of any particular prior relational contact with the world.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">I am interested particularly in what both Russell and
the philosophers of the Brentano tradition called <U>presentations</U>,
acts of singular reference, perception or memory directed towards (what
is given as) a single object, bearing within themselves a presupposition
of the existence of this object and typically occurring as components of
larger acts or complexes of acts. (An act of singular reference, for example,
will normally occur as part or moment of an act of judging, questioning,
etc. ) Acts of desire and other acts given as being merely potentially
directed towards what might or ought to exist, or acts directed towards,
say, clocks in general, or numbers in general, will therefore fall outside
our purview, though they will of course have to be treated in any complete
account.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">An act is <U>intentional</U> if it is to its subject
as if he is directed toward some object or objects. All acts of presentation
are intentional in this sense; indeed, members of this category may be
said to come closest to the original significance of '<U>intentio</U>'
as a 'stretching out' or 'reaching towards' (with the connotation of an
exertion of will). An act of presentation is <U>veridically</U> intentional
where not only is it the case that it is to its subject as if he is directed
toward some object, but there is in fact an object toward which he is directed
- and that object which, in the given act, he was aiming to hit. An act
of presentation is <U>non-veridically</U> intentional where it is to its
subject as if he is directed toward some object and there is no such object.
The veridical/non-veridical opposition is of course generalisable beyond
the narrow class of presentational acts to embrace also for example acts
of judgment bound up with these (cf. Husserl, LU VI &sect; &sect; 4f. )
and in principle also associated <U>states</U> of conviction or belief.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_">(4)</A></SUP>
It cannot, however, be extended to encompass all mental acts and states.
(Consider, besides desires, etc., also acts of recognition and other act-
and state- complexes reported by factive verbs.)</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">To admit relational acts, now, is tantamount to accepting
that there is a further distinction to be drawn amongst veridically intentional
acts between (i) those acts whose direct edness toward a given factually
existing transcendent object is effected <U>indirectly</U>, for example
by means of descriptions, theories, representations, images (or - in ways
still to be made clear - by means of other transcendent objects); and (ii)
properly relational acts whose connection to the relevant object is in
some sense direct. This distinction having once been made clear, the objects
of acts might then accordingly also be divided into (i) those objects which
can <U>only</U> be given indirectly; and (ii) those objects with which
cognitive relational contact is in principle possible (which can of course
<U>also</U> be given indirectly).</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Precisely where the line is to be drawn will be a matter
of detailed reflection. Are objects which no longer exist, for example,
objects with which we may achieve relational contact? Are we right to think
of the various sorts of abstracta as objects to which reference can be
made only via language? Could an act effect relational contact with an
object even though the <U>content</U> of the act embodies presuppositions
which are false? Or could there be something like a content-free relational
act, parallel to the connotation-free appellations promoted by advocates
of the causal theory of names? And would such an act deserve the title
'<U>cognitive</U> relation'?<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_">(5)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">For our present purposes it will be enough to assume
(naturalistic realism, again) that the broad mass of our ordinary perceptual
experiences are relational acts.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">(6)</A></SUP> It will
follow, correlatively, that material objects in the perceptual world are
all of them possible objects of cognitive relations.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&sect; 6. A Theory of Relations I: Material vs. Formal
Relations</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The commitment to relational acts is, as will by now
be clear, at odds with Husserl's properly phenomenological philosophy.
It is, however, close to many elements in the earlier and still neglected
pre-phenomenological work of Husserl, and it is from this source, specifically
from the 3rd Logical Investigation on the theory of wholes and parts, that
we shall draw the basis of our ontology of relations. The force of Husserl's
slogan '<U>zur&uuml;ck zu den Sachen selbst</U>' is here taken to consist
not only in the exhortation to suspend presuppositions, but also in the
commonsensical insistence that to see a cat is to enter into a direct relation
with <U>the cat itself</U> and not with some cat-description or -noema
or -sense-datum-complex.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Standard systems of part-whole theory, for example the
mereology of Leniewski or Goodman's calculus of individuals, are in effect
theories of one single (transitive) relation of part to whole. Husserl,
in contrast, puts forward a theory which deals also with a family of non-transitive,
non-extensive, as it were lateral, relations <U>amongst the parts</U> of
a single whole. We may understand what Husserl is getting at intuitively
as follows. Parts of a whole may exist merely side by side, like trees
in a forest. Each tree is then independent of its neighbours, can in principle
be detached or separated from the whole forest without detriment to the
residue. The parts of a whole may also however<U> interpenetrate</U>, in
a range of different ways, so that they are dependent upon and inseparable
from their neighbours, and this not simply as a matter of fact but <U>necessarily</U>.
Given parts may be such that they can exist <U>only</U> in specific types
of combination with each other in a single whole. The parts in question
- for example the individual colour and shape of a perceived visual datum
- will then perhaps not be recognisable as 'parts' ('pieces') in the usual
sense of this term, precisely because the term normally carries the connotation
of detachability. Yet Husserl saw that such items bear relations to their
respective wholes which are formally indistinguishable from the part-whole
relations of standard mereology - and that there are important advantages
to be gained from developing a richer theory of part and whole in which
the simple and relatively degenerate theory of mereological <U>piece</U>-whole
relations would be extended to embrace also the family of relations amongst
dependent or inseparable parts.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">It would take us too far afield to present more than
a minimal skeleton of Husserl's theory here. It rests upon the two basic
notions of <U>part</U> and <U>foundation</U> or <U>dependence</U>. Foundation
can be defined modally as follows:<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">(7)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&lt;D1> a is founded on b if and only if a is (<U>de
re</U>) necessarily such that it cannot exist unless b exists and b is
not a part of a.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">'a' and 'b', here, are to be understood as standing in
for names of objects which exist merely contingently, in space and time.
The final clause is included in order to avoid the implication that every
object is trivially a founded object, in virtue of foundation relations
in which it would then stand to its (proper and improper) parts. (And in
this context it is worth noting the terminological similarity of the given
definition to the principle of mereological essentialism defended by Chisholm
and others, to the effect that every object is necessarily such that it
depends for its existence precisely upon the existence of its parts. See
e. g. Chisholm, 1976, Appendix B. )</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The classical infinite regress argument in the theory
of relations shows, in effect, that <U>every</U> complex whole must involve
some ultimate relation or relations of connection, in virtue of which the
parts of the whole are configurated together to form that whole. This relation
cannot be itself a part, since we could then always go on to ask how <U>it</U>
is related to the other parts of the relevant whole. Relations of foundation,
Husserl claimed, are precisely such ultimate relations of connection or
configuration. Indeed he went so far as to claim (LU III &sect; 22) that
everything that is unified involves relations of foundation. To say that
foundation relations are not themselves parts of the wholes whose parts
they configure, in the present context, is to affirm that they are not
material but rather purely <U>formal</U> relations. Like the primitive
<U>is a part of</U> itself, and like number and the logical constants and
the relation of set-membership, foundation is defined without reference
to any specific material notions; it is applicable in principle to all
matters, irrespective of their specific qualitative determinations.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">What concerns us here is exclusively the implication
of Husserl's theory for the problem of understanding cognitive relatedness.
Every act is in the sense of the definition &lt;D1> a founded object, an
object <U>cum fundamentum in re</U>, since every act is (presumably) such
that it cannot exist unless its subject exists. <SUP><A HREF="#N_8_">(8)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The foundation between act and subject is <U>one-sided</U>:
an act is founded on its subject; but neither a subject nor an organism
seems to be the kind of thing that could be founded on an act. Foundation
relations may also, however, be <U>mutual</U>: the thesis that sensory
data are secondary qualities consists, in effect, in the assertion of a
mutual relation of foundation between an act of sensation and its datum
of sense: this act cannot as a matter of necessity exist without that datum;
but nor either can the datum exist without this act. (This is just one
example of a range of metaphysical theses which can be formulated economically
in foundation-theoretic terms. )<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">What, now, in the case of a relational act? Here the
subject, act and object form a <U>complex whole</U> whose parts are configurated
together by means of two relations of one-sided foundation between act
and subject, and between act and object, respectively. The whole exists
only to the extent that and for as long as the material relation linking
subject and object exists. Both subject and object exist independently
of their configuration in the given whole. The act itself, in contrast,
is necessarily such that it could not have existed except in the context
of this whole with (these) two other parts. It is in this sense that it
is relational in structure. <SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">(10)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">&sect; 7. A Theory of Relations II: Direct Foundation</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">An acount of relational acts in terms of the simple notion
of foundation specified in the definition &lt;D1> above remains inadequate,
however, even to serve as the basis of a formally acceptable notion of
act-relationality (i. e. leaving aside all questions of material adequacy).
Two major difficulties present themselves. It is necessary, first of all,
to take account of the fact that the relational act is in <U>direct</U>
contact with its object. We shall then need to delineate the sense of foundation
which is at issue here from a more general sense according to which <U>every</U>
veridical act may be said to be (trivially, analytically) founded on its
object.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">With regard to the first difficulty, note that a descriptional
act, too, may be founded on its object. Such an act may inherit from other
acts the character of being necessarily such that it cannot exist unless
its object exists. Suppose you see two persons in process of becoming reconciled
in such a way that there is a relational act of perceiving the <U>event
of reconciliation</U> that is taking place. And suppose your curiosity
leads you to the descriptional act of wondering about <U>the disagreement
on which this reconciliation is based</U>. Then the latter is clearly founded
on the former, which is itself, as a relational act, founded on the reconciliation
which is its object - and this object is in its turn as a matter of fact
founded on the disagreement which is the object of the given descriptional
act. Since the part-theoretic constraints on the transitivity of foundation
are here trivially met, it follows that the given descriptional act is
founded, as it were <U>indirectly</U>, upon its object. Here a diagram
may, perhaps, be of some help.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">(11)</A></SUP></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">As the diagram should make clear, a properly relational
act is founded <U>directly</U> upon its object, i. e., intuitively and
provisionally, is founded upon its object in a relation of foundation that
does not involve any mediation via other relations of foundation.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">(12)</A></SUP>
This formulation is provisional only, first of all because relations of
direct foundation as here intuitively understood may obtain in conjunction
with other relations of indirect foundation between the same objects. That
is: there may be distinct foundational routes, of different lengths, between
given objects, and this is something which must be recognised in any complete
account.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE=""><B>b</B>, here, is indirectly founded on <B>a</B>, according
to the definition just supplied, yet we should surely wish to insist that
<B>b</B> is <U>also</U> directly founded on <B>a</B>. <B>b</B> is, for
example, a particular judgment (judging act), formulated by a subject <B>a</B>
and therefore dependent upon <B>a</B>, but also formulated in Greek, and
therefore dependent upon that particular complex cognitive state, <B>c</B>,
which is <B>a</B>'s knowledge of Greek. Alternatively: <B>b</B> is <B>a</B>'s
recovery from an illness <B>c</B>, illness and recovery being alike one-sidedly
founded on <B>a</B> and related to each other via a further relation of
one-sided foundation.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">Even presupposing an adequate definition of direct foundation,
however, it would not do simply to restrict relational acts to those directly
founded on their objects. What needs to be excluded, it seems, are only
certain kinds of transmission of relationality, above all those which occur
through foundation relations amongst independent intermediary objects.
For relationality may in some circumstances be preserved in transmission,
most obviously where the medium of foundation is constituted entirely by
other <U>acts</U> of the subject in question. Thus let us suppose that
a given perceptual experience <B>a</B> of an object <B>b</B> is sufficent
to establish my relational contact with this object. Subsequent memories
directed towards <B>b</B> must then surely inherit relatedness to <B>b</B>
to the extent that they are founded directly upon <B>a</B> - and this on
being iterated, opens up the possibility of a <U>historical</U> theory
of cognitive relatedness, a theory of the transmission of relationality.<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">(13)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">All of which brings us back to the question mooted earlier,
whether relational contact is restricted to presently existing objects.
This restriction is dictated by our present account, but only if a tensed
reading of 'exists' is adopted in the definition of foundation &lt;D1>
above. Husserl's original theory is however perfectly consistent with an
untensed reading, which would allow relational contact not only with past
but also, in principle, with future objects. The term 'complex whole' -
for example as this is used in the final paragraph of the preceding section
- would then embrace also wholes not all of whose parts exist simultaneouly.</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&sect;&nbsp; 8. A Theory of Relations III: Synthetic
Foundation</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">What makes my thought of <B>b</B> a thought of <B>b</B>
(<B>b</B> an object not identical with myself) is therefore either:</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">(i) that this thought is itself a direct cognitive relation
in which I stand to <B>b</B>, that <B>b</B> is the direct object of my
thought (which will imply, in normal circumstances, that <B>b</B> is an
object of a present perception or of some similar act);</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">(ii) that this thought stands in foundation relations
to previous perceptual and other experiences having <B>b</B> as direct
object; or</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">(iii) that the thought is not relational at all, but
that as a matter of fact <B>b</B> (and <B>b</B> alone) satisfies its descriptional
content.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">There remains one further obvious formal difficulty confronting
this account, however, turning on the fact that <U>any</U> veridical act
may be conceived, under a description formulated by use of appropriate
correlative terms, as being necessarily such that it cannot exist unless
its object exists. Thus a descriptional act of thinking about the owner
of a given cap, for example, is necessarily such that it cannot exist,
<U>as such</U>, unless the owner of the cap himself exists. Clearly there
is a need to find some means of rendering harmless such cases of analytic
or logical necessitation. Husserl's own preference is to exclude analytic
cases from the class of foundation relations by definition, but this presupposes
that he has some independent demarcation of analyticity and it is far from
clear that the account he offers is of general applicability (cf. LU III
&sect; 10ff). Not all analytic propositions involve an analytic connection
which is so clearly manifest as in the case of correlative terms. Here,
therefore, I should like to suggest an alternative approach. This will
involve the theoretical expedient of accepting the objects denoted by correlative
terms as <U>bona fide</U> objects standing in <U>bona fide</U> foundation
relations. I shall then show that it is possible to define a narrower notion
of what I shall call <U>absolute foundation</U>, in terms involving no
appeal to a notion of analyticity, which will capture that type of non-
correlative dependence which is of interest here.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">The approach is best explained by means of an example.
Consider the relation between husband Hans and his wife Erna. Should Erna
cease to exist, then as a matter of necessity her <U>husband</U> Hans will
also cease to exist. And vice versa. A husband is, according to our working
definition &lt;D1> above, mutually founded on a wife. But Hans can of course
perfectly well continue to exist <U>as a human being</U> even after the
death of his wife (and naturally he had so existed long before his marriage).
Hans is, we might say, merely relatively founded on Erna (founded on Erna
<U>as a husband</U>, but not <U>as a human being</U>). An act, in contrast,
is absolutely founded on its subject; it cannot exist as something else,
cannot be individuated in such a way that it would be cut adrift from its
role or status as an act. And a relational act is absolutely founded both
upon its subject and upon its object: the same act could not have existed
in some other capacity in the absence of this object.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">It is this concept of absolute foundation which we need
to isolate here. To this end we must first of all say something about the
relation between a given object and its correlative <U>Doppelgnger</U>
(between Hans, say, and Hans <U>in his capacity as</U> husband). This relation
is one of <U>ontological coincidence</U>:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">&lt;D2> <B>a</B> is coincident with <B>b</B> if and only
if <B>a</B> is not identical with <B>b</B> but all parts of <B>a</B> are
parts of <B>b</B> and vice versa.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">Thus Hans <U>qua</U> husband is - tensed reading of 'is'
(or try: <U>is at all times at which he is a husband</U>) - coincident
with, but - <U>inter alia</U> because they have different histories - not
identical to, Hans <U>qua</U> human being. Coincidence is not confined
to correlatives: persons are coincident with bodies; <U>David qua</U> work
of art is coincident with, but not identical to, <U>David qua</U> quantity
of matter.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">(14)</A></SUP> Thus we reject the counterintuive,
though logically highly tractable, view according to which things (substances,
continuants) are four-dimensional aggregates or sums of temporal parts.
As I get older, I do not (thereby) acquire more parts.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The concept of absolute foundation may now be defined
follows:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&lt;D3> a is founded absolutely on b if and only if a
is founded on b and a is not coincident with any object not founded on
b.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">Material relations proper are distinguished from other
material items in the world - nuts and bolts, pieces of string, contracts,
treaties - which may serve to connect together objects in reality, by the
fact that the former but not the latter are absolutely founded objects.
They are unable to exist except in the context in which they serve as relations.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">An absolutely founded object in the sense of our definition
corresponds to what Husserl calls a <U>moment</U>:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&lt;D4> <B>a</B> is a moment if and only if there is
some <B>b</B> such that <B>a</B> is founded absolutely on <B>b</B>.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">And we may define conversely:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&lt;D5> a is a <U>fundament</U> if and only if there
is some b such that b is absolutely founded on a.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">All relational acts are <U>moments</U> in the sense of
&lt;D4>, exhibiting one-sided relations of direct or act-mediated absolute
foundation upon both subject and object, which may themselves exist independently
of the relational complexes thereby constituted.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">&sect; 9. Remarks on Material Ontology</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">This (still rudimentary) account of the <U>formal</U>
ontology of the relational act will perforce be insufficient to distinguish
relational acts from other kinds of material relations sharing an identical
formal structure. It is precisely in this, however, that there lies one
benefit of the present approach. For if relational acts can be assigned
to a wider category, other members of which are for different reasons well-understood,
then by paying attention to the similarities and differences between relational
acts and other members of this category we may hope to understand them
better and so cash out some of the metaphors of 'acquaintance', 'direct
contact', or 'epistemic intimacy', and the like.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Relational acts are, in particular (and modulo differences
in degree of complexity), formally indistinguishable from <U>relational
actions and events</U> such as promisings, fights, thefts, conversations,
kissings, hittings, weddings, greetings, and so forth.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">(15)</A></SUP>
And they resemble relational events also in a number of material respects.
(Both categories are alike distinguished, for example, from that of static
relational qualities: love, marriage, authority, obligation, etc. ) My
hope is that from the perusal of relational events in general it would
be possible to extract principles which, in being made precise, may be
applied to the further elucidation of the structure of relational acts.
What follows is, as will rapidly become clear, nothing more than a crude
first venture into this field.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">Relational events in the categories that interest us are
emergent entities, existing with other like entities on levels of stability
of structure above the level of the purely physical, and forming part of
the subject-matters of the various higher level sciences (linguistics,
legal theory, military history, etc. ). Such sciences have the task of
determining precise criteria of individuation for the emergent objects
in their respective domains, objects which are not normally demarcated
from each other in ways so manifest and so clear cut as we are used to
in relation to the everyday objects of perception. Relational events are
spatio-temporal complexes, comprising within themselves other more or less
complicated happenings at various levels, and coincident with the aggregate
of such happenings (as a promise, for example, is coincident with the aggregate
of given utterance/auditory phenomena and delineates and articulates the
latter in a certain way). Thus relational events may be compared, in many
respects, to institutions in society.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">There is no relational event between two or more given
objects unless there is <U>some</U> causal involvement of these objects,
though it is important that this involvement may be mediated via other
objects: the Hamburg representative of a Sao Paulo coffee company may sign
contracts on behalf of his principal in virtue of which the latter becomes
involved in relational events with third parties with whom he is never
causally in contact.<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">(16)</A></SUP></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Applying these remarks, crude as they are, to the mental
sphere, yields the following provisional picture of the material ontology
of relational acts.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Like acts in general, relational acts are emergent objects.
(There is contact between subject and object not only on the level of physical
events, but also at the properly cognitive level. We may <U>keep track
of</U> objects in the world not only as a result of involuntary causal
interaction, but also via deliberate activities of mind. ) Each relational
act, that is to say, is a complex spatio-temporal, but not thereby straightforwardly
physical/causal, entity. Each has an external cause (in the most general
sense of this term) and each also coincides with or comprehends within
itself an array of causal goings on, which it serves both to circumscribe
and to articulate. To this array some specific mediate or immediate causal
involvement of subject and object is indispensable. The objects of relational
acts will</FONT> <FONT FACE="">therefore be restricted to those items in
the material world which are such that they, or their parts and fundaments,
can stand in causal relations.<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_">(17)</A></SUP> It is
in this sense that relational acts manifest a mutual interdependence of
causal and cognitive elements, as mentioned in &sect; 3 above.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">In embracing the notion of coincidence the way is opened
for a stratified view of spatio-temporal reality in which what is materially
(causally) the same thing, process or quality may reappear, at different
levels, in different foundation-theoretic guises. Of course, before remarks
like these might coagulate into theory they must clearly be supplemented,
first of all by a rigorous treatment of coincidence,<SUP><A HREF="#N_18_">(18)</A></SUP>
and also by a rigorous treatment of causality - perhaps along the lines
of Ingarden's theory of relatively isolated systems in Vol. III of <U>The
Controversy over the Existence of the World</U> (1974). Note that the the
distinction between coincidence and identity is needed for present methodological
purposes even if one allows that it <U>may</U> prove ultimately to be dispensable.
Naive physicalism may be true, and then coincidence collapses into identity;
all so-called higher level structures are nothing more than the micro-level
physical systems in which they are realised. But to assume already at this
stage that coincidence and identity are one - an assumption charactristic
of almost all contemporary analytic philosophy - and to fail to exploit
the resources put at our disposal by the notions of coincidence and foundation
is premature, to say the least, and may conceivably foreclose important
options.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">What, now, of the material <U>differences</U> between
relational acts and other members of the category of relational events?
Relational acts are distinguished, first of all, by the fact that they
necessarily involve a <U>subject</U> as fundament, and by their necessary
asymmetry: they are directed <U>from</U> the subject <U>towards</U> his
target object, and not <U>vice versa</U>. Both features are shared also
by relational <U>actions</U> such as promisings or hittings. Acts are however
distinguished materially from actions by the fact that all actions are
necessarily such that they can serve as terms in <U>by-relations</U>: one
can do one thing <U>by</U> doing another (kill Hans by pulling the trigger)
- where an act, on the other hand, may serve as term in a by-relation only
to the extent that it is part of an action (e. g. of a use of words).<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">(19)</A></SUP>
It is the material by-relation which structures both individual actions
and the realm of actions as a whole, and it is this relation also which
sets this realm apart (<U>inter alia</U>) from the realm of acts. All of
which suggests that great caution is required in attempts, for example
of the sort canvassed by Searle in his book <U>Intentionality</U> (1983),
to further our understanding of the material structures of cognitive acts
by drawing analogies between acts and actions.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">&sect; 10. Against Cartesianism</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">Consider the spectrum of veridical presentations directed
towards (what are given as) material objects. At the one extreme we have
what might be called purely <U>descriptive</U> presentations, above all
veridical acts of singular reference involving expressions like 'the tallest
spy' used by persons who are innocent of any knowledge as to who in particular
the tallest spy might be. At the opposite extreme we have acts which belong
to the hard core of relational presentations, particularly acts of ordinary
perception. Between these two extremes there is encountered a complicated
variety of mixed and defective cases. My hope is that the theory of relational
acts might provide means for generating a non-trivial understanding of
this spectrum, puzzling cases included. But note that there is an analogous,
if somewhat truncated spectrum of cases of non-veridical presentations.
I may use an expression like 'the tallest werewolf' in the serious but
mistaken belief that it has a referent; or I may suffer an illusion that
there is a cat staring at me in my study. And what is important is that
the mental experiences then involved are, as they occur, phenomenologically
indistinguishable from corresponding veridical experiences. It is for this
reason that the prejudice has arisen that <U>as acts</U> veridical and
non-veridical experiences are to be described identically, that the existence
or non-existence of an object is entirely incidental to the act as such.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">The commitment to relational acts implies, however, that
there are properties of mental acts that are not transparent to their subjects.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">(20)</A></SUP>
Since relationality itself is one such property, it must follow (<U>pace</U>
Chisholm, 1981, ch. 9 on "Knowledge and belief <U>de re</U>"), that no
epistemological criterion of relationality can be supplied. But this is
not to say that relationality is somehow an extraordinary feature of acts,
of which the subject is simply unaware. Rather, as proponents of naturalistic
realism have long insisted, our acts are already imbued with objective
significance. A tacit - normally fully</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="">justified - supposition of relationality is the norm
or default, and it is deviations from this norm - for example when perceptually
generated expectations are frustrated - which are marked in the experiences
of the subject. To put the matter in another way, we normally assume without
question that our thoughts are not merely veridical but that they are in
fact <U>de</U> the relevant <U>res</U>.<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_">(21)</A></SUP>
Further, we normally assume that our acts are <U>de</U> the relevant <U>res</U>
even where the objects of our acts are of such a kind that they could not
even in principle serve as the objects of relational acts. How exactly
our mediate cognitive access to such objects (to abstracta, for example)
is built up on the basis of direct cognitive access to realia, is a large
problem, to the solution of which inspiration may be sought, perhaps, from
Husserl's and Ingarden's work on constitutive phenomenology.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">It is now possible to draft a first account of non-veridical
presentations: all such presentations are, in our earlier terminology,
descriptional or mixed acts the criteria of satisfaction of which are not
met. The fact that such presentations are <U>given</U> to their subjects
as relational is neither here nor there, since, as we have already argued,
it is true also of non-relational <U>veridical</U> acts that they standardly
present themselves to their subjects as if they were relational. Just as
there is a tendency for our veridical experience to approximate to the
status of relationality, so there is a tendency, illustrated by what Evans
calls the 'conniving use of empty singular terms' (<U>op. cit.</U>, p.
123), for our non-veridical experience to approximate to the status of
veridicality.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT FACE="">If we now ask what is the <U>object</U> of a non-veridical
presentation, then we must at last bite the bullet of naturalistic realism
- in a way which should bring no comfort to the phenomenologists of 'intentional
objects' or 'notional worlds' - and insist that such an act <U>has no object</U>;
it is merely to its subject as if it has an object. The subject thinks
that it is thinking (<U>de re</U> or <U>de dicto</U>) about something.
But the subject is wrong.<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_">(22)</A></SUP></FONT>

be applied, with suitable precautions, also to (enduring) states. On the
(foundation) relations between acts and states and on the importance of
both for a theory of judgment see Reinach, 1982, <U>passim</U>, On a generalisation
of the veridical/non-veridical opposition to the various types of imagination
and to emotions see Mulligan and Smith, 1984.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_5_"></A><FONT FACE="">5. <U>Op. cit</U>., p. 614. The term
'cognitive' in the present paper is taken to signify those acts which are
either themselves judgmental in form or are potentially bound up with judgments
inferentially, as when MacBeth's (apparent) perception of a dagger licences
his inference to 'there is a dagger before me now'. On the nature of the
inferential connection between presentations and (true or false, positive
or negative) judgments see Reinach, <U>op. cit</U>. Part I.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_6_"></A><FONT FACE="">6. On the contents and conditions of
ordinary perceptual experiences much of Husserlian phenomenology may still
be of value; see e. g. the papers by Fllesdal collected in Dreyfus, ed.
and now also Woodruff Smith, 1982.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">The problem of contents is not centrally at issue in a
discussion of act-relationality, since the contents of relational and non-relational
acts are not in general distinguishable.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_7_"></A><FONT FACE="">7. For the sake of simplicity we shall
here ignore the technical distinction which Husserl draws between foundation
on the one hand and dependence on the other. Details of the formal ontological
theory of part and whole, including reference to Husserl's writings and
a range of possible applications, are presented in the papers collected
in Smith, ed., 1982. Cf. also the works by Sokolowski listed in the bibliography
of writings on part-whole theory appended to that volume.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_8_"></A><FONT FACE="">8. This 'presumably' is inserted in
order to mark the fact that nothing in what follows will turn on any particular
view as to the nature of the subject, self or ego. The theory of relational
acts could indeed in principle be made consistent with a <U>no-self theory</U>
of the kind which Husserl himself embraced in the 1st edition of the <U>Logical
Investigations</U>, though then the subject- term of the relation would
need reinterpreting as e. g. the brain or as the entire human being.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_9_"></A><FONT FACE="">9. Cf. Smith, ed., <U>passim</U>. Note
that, as Husserlian phenomenology has so convincingly demonstrated, there
are one-sided and mutual foundation relations also amongst acts and amongst
the parts of acts: mental experience is not a collection of unproblematically
isolable units, but a complex dynamic flow.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_10_"></A><FONT FACE="">10. This account of the relational
act, so far as it goes, recalls the account of <U>de re</U> thoughts given
by Woodfield in his Foreword to <U>Thought and Object</U>:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">a <U>de re</U> thought has the following features: it
is about an actually existing object, and it is tied to that object <U>constitutively</U>,
so that the thought could not exist without the very object's existing.
The kind of impossibility alluded to is logical or metaphysical rather
than causal. The thought could not exist without the object because it
is <U>individuated</U> in a way that makes its relatedness to that object
essential to its nature. (p. v)</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">But even at this stage there are important differences.
Above all, there can be no suggestion that the impossibility of independent
existence of a relational act should be a logical or analytic impossibility,
or an impossibility that flows from the manner of individuation of the
act. (Cf. &sect; 8 below. )</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_11_"></A><FONT FACE="">11. On the provenance of such diagrams
see Smith, ed., <U>op. cit.</U>, pp. 81-91, and the references there given.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_12_"></A><FONT FACE="">12. a is directly founded on b in
this sense if and only if a is founded on b and there is no c such that
a is founded on c and c on b.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_13_"></A><FONT FACE="">13. Standard historical theories of
reference, for example the Kripkean theory of causal transmission, or the
information-based theory put forward by Evans, 1982, ch. 5, are radically
more ambitious in allowing transmission also from person to person, via
communicative utterances. It would seem to be one implication of the type
of theory here advanced that an ambition of this sort is misplaced.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_14_"></A><FONT FACE="">14. These remarks on correlatives
should be compared to the theory of '<U>qua</U> objects' developed by Fine
and sketched in his 1982. On coincidence see also Doepke, 1982. Of course,
a systematic employment of the notion of coincidence as defined above would
be of value only to the extent that there is a fully worked-out theory
of part and whole whose comprehension axioms are appropriately weak.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_15_"></A><FONT FACE="">15. Note that the relational events
in each of these categories are crucially distinct from the <U>relational
changes</U> (John's becoming taller than Mary) more commonly discussed
in the literature on events. The latter, but not the former, are nothing
more than pairs or sums or logical constructs out of non- relational events
or processes.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_16_"></A><FONT FACE="">16. Our understanding of relational
actions and events is derived from the work of Adolf Reinach, an early
follower of Husserl who, in applying the theory of foundation relations
to legal phenomena such as promisings, baptisings, and so on, anticipated
much of what later became known as the theory of speech acts. Cf. Reinach
(forthcoming), together with Smith, ed., pp. 289-313, and the references
there given.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_17_"></A><FONT FACE="">17. The clause between commas is inserted
to remind the reader of what was said in &sect; 3 above, that relational
contact is not confined to things. It embraces also moments of things as
well as higher order unities containing both things and moments as parts
- and all manner of beast between these two extremes. On the perception
of moments see Mulligan, Simons and Smith, 1983.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_18_"></A><FONT FACE="">18. It may by this means be possible
to give sense to the still somewhat metaphorical talk of 'higher-level
properties being <U>realised in</U> microlevel systems' of the sort engaged
in by Searle, for example, in his contribution to this volume.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_19_"></A><FONT FACE="">19. This account is provisional only.
Further details are provided by Mulligan in his "Acts and Actions". A by-relation
is a truth- maker of a sentence of the form '<B>a</B> F-ed by G-ing' where
(i) the F-ing and G-ing in question are not simply causally related, (ii)
the F-ing and G-ing are not related as whole to part, and (iii) 'F' and
'G', when fully specified, are not related as determinable to determinate.
The by-relations thereby determined are all, Mulligan argues, irreversible.</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_20_"></A><FONT FACE="">20. As Woodfield conceives the matter,
this may extend even to the <U>object</U> of the act:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><FONT FACE="">According to a <U>de re</U> theorist, the subject can
have full conscious access to the internal subjective aspects of a thought
while remaining ignorant about which thought it is. This is because a <U>de
re</U> thought also has an <U>external</U> aspect which consists in its
being related to a specific object. Because the external relation is not
determined subjectively, the subject is not authoritative about that. A
third person might well be in a better position than the subject to know
which object the subject is thinking about, hence be better placed in that
respect to know which thought it was. (p. viif. )</FONT></UL>
<FONT FACE="">-- which brings us back once more to the question whether
it is possible that an act should effect relational contact with an object
even though its content is inappropriate to this object.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="N_21_"></A><FONT FACE="">21. It is for <U>this</U> reason that
conversations like the following is absurd:</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="">Ralph: I believe that the man with the bottle is drunk.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">Ortcutt: But about the man with the bottle, do you believe
he is drunk?</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="">Ralph: No, I never said that. That would be a <U>de re</U>
belief and I have merely a <U>de dicto</U> belief. I never said (a) About
the man with the bottle I believe he is drunk. But only (b) I believe that
the man with the bottle is drunk. (Searle, 1981, p. 725.)</FONT>

<P><A NAME="N_22_"></A><FONT FACE="">22. </FONT>The paper has benefited
from the relational contact it has had with David Bell, Cynthia MacDonald,
Mark Sacks, John Searle, Jeremy Shearmur, Edward Swiderski and Andrew Woodfield.</UL>
