<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Sixteen Arguments Against the Lockean Theory</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
The theory has never been empirically instantiated. Thus homesteading in
North America gave rise to property rights because homesteading licenses
had been granted to farmers or prospectors by the king, who had sent his
surveyors in advance.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory is sometimes defended as a theory of how property rights ought
to have<I> </I>originated. But ought implies can, and it is questionable
whether property rights <I>could</I> originate in the way the theory describes.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory is utopian: it ignores hard facts concerning the wars, might,
differential power, and other well-documented phenomena which in fact gave
rise to property rights (and to sovereign rights) in the course of history.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory is cut loose from evolutionary biological accounts of how the
institutions of property originated.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
Many millions of people throughout history have been mixing their labor
with unowned land and have not thereby become property owners. (<I>Vide</I>
the decisions of successive courts regarding aboriginal land.)</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory cannot distinguish between possession and ownership. More generally:
the idea of mixing labor can not by itself answer the question which set
of ownership rights vest in the owner, e.g., private usufruct, private
ownership, communal, and so on.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
It is hard to define labor (and even more so the act of 'mixing' your labor).</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The doctrine is subject to many of the problems raised already against
Marxian 'labor' theories of value. Thus for example it assumes that there
is some unitary thing/stuff called 'labor'. As the Marxian theory neglects
the fact that labor itself is of value only because of a surrounding context
of other things which have value, so the homesteading theory neglects the
fact that the very same action, for example digging a hole, may be 'labor'
in one context but not in another.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory gives no account of the precise extent or precise shape or location
of the land in which property rights would be acquired through the mixing
of labor.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory gives no account of the temporal extent of property rights (for
example, as was initially almost always the case, where those who are mixing
their labor with land were nomadic).</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory neglects the degree to which the institutions of property are
a human achievement of high order, a new sort of legal-economic-geometric
technology, that was added to the mere mixing of labor, for example when
Europeans began to colonize the lands of North and South America.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory neglects the degree to which the same institutions of property
can exist in different cultures to different degrees (for example in proportion
to the degree to which there exist efficient and honest systems of cadastral
registration).</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory neglects important analogies between property, on the one hand,
and sovereignty, on the other.</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
If taken seriously as giving license to property rights in things previously
unowned, the theory would appear to have ludicrous consequences. In particular,
it licenses and encourages willy-nilly destruction of resources as a means
of propertizing them (as in: if you want to own that thing over there,
just labor on it a bit and it's yours).</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
The theory appears to deny license to those whose use of resources is not
easily construable as labor-mixing (as in hunter-gatherers, perhaps). While
this may be acceptable to some, it contradicts at least some of the motivation
for the labor-mixing principle itself (whether theologically or naturalistically
interpreted).<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
The theory is not at all easy to apply in various interesting cases, for
example involving intellectual property. With what does one mix one's labor
when one comes up with a novel idea? Perhaps there should be no intellectual
property rights, but the reason should not be simply that our choice of
theory can not accommodate such things.</LI>
