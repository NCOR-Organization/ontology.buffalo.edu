<P>It has long been a preoccupation of John Searle to answer the question
"how do the various parts of the world relate to each other--how does it
all hang together?" In his newest book, he focuses on the aspect of the
world composed of facts which exist in virtue of human cognition. He refers
to this aspect of the world as social reality, and he attempts to lay bare
the foundations of its ontological analysis. He puts to use, in an original
and useful way, the tools which he developed in the course of dealing with
issues pertaining to the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of language.

<P>In suggesting that human cognition is the criterion which allows us
to divide nature from culture, Searle builds upon the distinction between
brute and institutional facts, which he developed and discussed in his
influential <I>Speech Acts</I>. In his analysis of this distinction, Searle
also makes use of his theory of intentionality, which he developed in another
influential book, <I>Intentionality</I>. One valuable contribution of <I>The
Construction of Social Reality</I> is to bring explicit unity to different
aspect of Searle's work.

<P>Brute facts exist independently of human cognition and they are the
paradigmatic component of nature, whereas institutional facts depend on
human cognition for their existence, and are the paradigmatic component
of social reality. 'The heart pumps blood' states a brute fact; 'The function
of the heart is to pump blood' states an institutional fact. Searle deems
this distinction crucial for his aims. Indeed, this distinction informs
the slogan which Searle incessantly repeats: "X counts as Y in context
C" (28, and <I>passim</I>). This rectangular sheet of green paper (brute
fact X), counts as money (institutional fact Y) in the United States (context
C).

<P>'Counting as' is the essence of all social reality. And Searle tells
us that the "apparatus necessary to account for social reality ... requires
exactly three elements. The assignment of function, collective intentionality,
and constitutive rules" (13). Regrettably, Searle is not clear regarding
the definitions of, and the relationships between, these elements. Yet,
Searle does state that the assignment of function is a "feature of intentionality"
(14) and that constitutive rules are, in some cases, the result of intentionality
(43 ff.). Since it turns out that two of the three elements are contained
in the other one, we might as well focus on this more general element:
collective intentionality.

<P>When two or more individuals (humans or otherwise) share intentional
states, we are in the presence of collective intentionality. According
to Searle, a mental state is intentional when it is "directed at or about
or of objects and states of affairs in the world". Searle's thesis regarding
social reality, then, is that a given piece of paper counts as money if
and only if some human beings (at least two, but more commonly 'many')
have a certain intentional state (typically, but by no means necessarily,
a belief) that it is money.

<P>In light of this thesis, two interrelated questions suggest themselves.
1) Whose intentional states are relevant in deciding, say, whether or not
a piece of paper is money? 2) To what extent do intentional states have
the efficaciousness Searle claims they have in creating institutional facts
(does the belief of merely two people that the sheets of paper in front
of them are money make them money)?

<P>It is clear that Searle requires that the intentionality involved in
the creation of social reality be <I>collective</I> intentionality. But
while this requirement certainly excludes the possibility of lone individuals
creating institutional facts, much more is needed. If my circle of friends
and I believe that the sheets of paper on my desk are money, are they money?
This problem is not at all trivial, as more poignant examples make clear.
Think of the Basques, or the Palestinians (or the Israelis under British
mandate), or the Republican Irish, etc. These are groups which collectively
believe that such and such territory, currently a part of <I>another </I>nation,
should count as their nation. Yet, in these cases, collective intentionality
is clearly <I>not</I> sufficient to create the sought after institutional
fact. Age-old conflicts over sovereignty as well as intricate landed property
disputes have scarcely been, and probably will never be, solved by merely
appealing to collective intentionality.

<P>Moreover, the case at the opposite end of the spectrum which Searle
excludes from the scope of his inquiry, that of a lone individual creating
a piece of social reality, also poses problems. It is possible, I think,
to have institutional facts arising from mere individual intentionality.
Buying flowers for my partner is an act of love; and it is an act of love
simply because of my very own intentional states, and it is clearly not
a brute fact. So if it is a social fact, it would be one based on individual
rather than on collective intentionality. Of course, Searle can claim that
this is not really a social act, but precisely whether and why this is
not a social act, are crucial questions which Searle does not address adequately.

<P>Closely related to the problem of whose intentional states are relevant
for the creation of this or that institutional fact, is the problem of
the efficaciousness of intentional states in creating or altering social
reality. If all the members of a given community suddenly believed that
there were no private property, or that sheets of white paper should count
as money, this would not thereby, <I>eo ipso</I>, transform the legal status
of land parcels, or of sheets of paper. Searle disagrees with this conclusion.
He tells us: "The moment, for example, that all or most of the members
of a society refuse to acknowledge property rights... property rights cease
to exist in that society" (117). Property rights in land, for example,
are typically granted in virtue of complicated networks of registry entries,
such that no intentional state can affect the status of that property right
without using the tools afforded by that very network. The ontological
complexity of this sort of network, incidentally, is not discussed by Searle.

<P>Intentional states seem to be more important to the construction (the
bringing into being) of social reality, than to what Searle (in spite of
the book's title) discusses more: the continued existence (the maintaining
in being) of social reality. The distinction between the construction and
continued existence of social reality is one which Searle does not analyze
deeply. The little he tells us about this crucial issue is unhelpful. "The
secret to understand the continued existence of institutional facts is
simply that the individuals directly involved and a sufficient number of
members of the relevant community must continue to recognize and accept
the existence of such facts" (117). If this is all there is to it, why
even call it a secret? Notice, moreover, the vagueness of the expression
'sufficient number' and 'relevant community' in this passage, and of 'most'
in the previous quotation, and, e.g., the fact that the number of people
might be very small if the <I>right </I>people still do the recognition,
accepting, etc.

<P>In addition to presenting these foundational elements of the ontology
of social reality, institutional reality and collective intentionality,
Searle also sketches the logical structure of institutional reality. "There
is exactly one primitive logical operation by which institutional reality
is created and constituted. It has this form: We collectively accept, acknowledge,
recognize, go along with, etc., that (S has power (S does A)) [where 'S'
stands for the name of an individual or group, and 'A' stands for the name
of an action]" (111). Power is the primitive term in the logic of institutional
reality. Searle is humble about the scope of his sketchy hypothesis, since
when referring to it he admits: "I do not know if it is true and I certainly
have not demonstrated it, but it is worth further exploration" (110-111).
Searle's hypothesis regarding the logical structure of institutional reality
does stand in need of further exploration, particularly in virtue of some
difficulties it has to face.

<P>This formula applies only to institutional reality, which Searle distinguishes
from social reality. Searle tells us "'Going for a walk with someone' names
a social fact, but not an institutional fact" (88). The distinction between
institutional and social facts is that only the former is accompanied by
the imposition of a function related to the transmission of power. But
then, a considerable amount of Searle's remarks are not, it turns out,
applicable to social reality, but merely to the subset of institutional
reality. It is not only 'going for a walk' which is put aside in Searle's
scheme, but a host of other cultural phenomena: any phenomenon in which
power is not transmitted.

<P>Searle's fixation with power obscures his otherwise glowing clarity.
He tells us: "There is an interesting class of exceptions to the claim
that all institutional facts involve power ... these are the cases where
the status [the 'Y' in the 'X counts as Y formula'] is purely honorific"
(96). But after a not too convincing, and thus not too Searlean, discussion
he concludes that the honorific cases are not really devoid of power transmissions,
and thus there is really no exception to the general claim (96-112). (Part
of Searle's strategy here is to extend the meaning of power so as to include
symbolic power, honorific power, conditional power, negative power, etc.
(110). But, as usual, when one stretches the meaning of a term too far,
the term rather ends up losing its meaning.) Searle's appraisal of this
exception as 'interesting' is an understatement. For these cases are more
than merely interesting: they are numerous and relevant. The practices
of praise and blame, the virtues of courage and generosity, the vices of
envy and selfishness, are but few examples of important cultural phenomena
which are excluded from Searle's scheme.

<P>I have presented several objections to Searle's ontology of social reality.
Yet, I believe this is an excellent book, one in which Searle might face
more difficulties than usual, given the lofty goal he has set himself to
accomplish. The ontology of social and cultural objects is indeed sorely
in need of attention. Searle has done a great service by chartering the
territory of this rich field, however generally and briefly. The book should
be required reading for those interested in the ontology of cultural objects,
and should be of great interest for anyone interested in Searle's work.</UL>
