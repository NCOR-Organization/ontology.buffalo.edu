We are pleased to announce that the Cell Component Ontology (CCO)
developed by the MetaCyc (http://metacyc.org) project is now freely
accessible at http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/CCO. CCO was developed to
provide a controlled vocabulary of terms for annotating the subcellular
locations of enzymes and compartments involved in transport reactions in
the MetaCyc biochemical pathway database. CCO contains 160 terms, many
of them were adopted from GO (http://geneontology.com). The CCO terms
are organized into a hierarchy strictly according to the is-a
relationship. In addition to the is-a relationship, CCO has component-of
and surrounded-by relationships. The latter is not used in GO. More
information is on http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/CCO.


The ontology can be downloaded in either OWL format or Ocelot format.
