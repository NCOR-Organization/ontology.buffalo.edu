<p><i>Summary</i>
<br>The ontology of marketing, particularly the question of what products
and brands are, is still largely unexplored. The ontological status of
brands hinges on their relationship with products. Idealists about brands
see perceptual or cognitive acts of consumers grouped under the heading
'brand awareness' or 'brand image' as constitutive for the existence of
brands so that, in their view, tools of the marketing mix can influence
relevant mental dispositions and attitudes. Brand realists, on the other
hand, reject the view of brands as mere marks or names and interpret them
as emergent products with properties that afford branding in the sense
of Gibson's ecological psychology. Brand strength is a function of the
degree to which brands occupy defensible niches in product space. Branding
as a process involves changing external or internal boundaries of products.
Several arguments are proposed in favor of brand realism. The fragments
of an ontology of marketing are developed in a broadly Aristotelian framework.
Brand realism has significant implications for a new understanding of issues
ranging from the effects of advertising to financial brand valuation, the
nature of trademarks, and marketing strategy in general. It permits one
to treat brand equity as a real phenomenon not dependent on associations,
attitudinal states such as brand loyalty, or spurious constructs such as
brand character or personality.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1. INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>Consumer goods, and particularly brands, are part of our common-sense
world. Yet marketing, the discipline that studies these phenomena, has
so far taken little notice of attempts to develop theories of domains of
common-sense reality by investigating its own ontology. Received marketing
theory holds that "only philosophers can afford to define products in ontological
terms, and that is only because for them it makes no operational difference
what the definition is" (Levitt 1969: 11). This view betrays some basic
misunderstandings.
<p>If ontological analysis has been applied to geographical space, linguistic
categories, real estate, visual perception, intellectual property rights,
'na&iuml;ve physics', cyberspace, ethical values, technical artifacts,
social relations, and economic objects, something as central in our lives
as the domain of commercial products should certainly afford an equal degree
of analytical scrutiny (see, e.g., Smith 1995; 1998, 1999; Smith/Casati
1994; Simons/Dement 1996; Smith/Varzi 1999a; Smith/Mark 1999).
<p>The ontology of the commercial world is of great complexity. This has
been recognized in the few attempts to reconstruct or model the categorial
framework in which we consider market relations. Economic theory is based
on primitive concepts such as: economic good, commodity, money, value,
price, and exchange. But it permits only few implications for purposes
of marketing, which studies objects not only under the aspect of their
specific utility for consumers but, going beyond the domain of economics,
also in regard to the opportunities, strategies and techniques of<i> influencing</i>
utility and exchange relations. One single project to develop an ontology
of business enterprises within an artificial intelligence framework has
thus far been undertaken, using the notion of brand as one of its primitives
(Uschold/King/Moralee/Zorgios 1998).
<p>One of the problems every ontological investigation encounters resides
in the fact that we can, at one and the same time, classify a region of
common-sense reality as comprising (physical or immaterial) objects, economic
goods, products, and brands. The subject areas of chemistry, physics, cognitive
psychology, economics and marketing overlap, and ontological clarification
is needed to identify why and how we deal with the same object differently
in marketing than, say, in microeconomic price theory.
<p>Over the past two decades, much of marketing theory has focussed on
explaining <i>brand equity</i>. It has been recognized that brands are
often the most valuable corporate assets, exceeding less dominant products
both in terms of consumer awareness and of financial valuation. The question
remains, however, what exactly constitutes brand equity. What causes products
such as Coca-Cola, the Hershey chocolate bar or Campbell's soup to be 'deep'
brands and to profit from a price premium while other colas, candies or
soups do not? More precisely, the challenge is to find "a way of bridging
the gap between the intangible perceptions of a brand and the revenues
realized from it" (Dyson/Farr/Hollis 1996: 10). Only this will adequately
explain why companies founded on strong brands are often acquired for up
to ten times their book value.
<p>There are theories that see brand equity as being anchored in consumer
awareness, as intangible assets of companies, or as a theoretical construct
which is functionally dependent on brand management (Aaker 1996; Keller
1993, 1998). Consumers perceive brand equity as the value added to a product
by associating it with a brand name and other distinctive characteristics.
Customer-based brand equity, then, depends on the degree to which consumers
are familiar with products and "hold some favorable, strong, and unique
brand associations in memory" (Keller 1993: 2). Considering the matter
from a financial perspective, companies view brand equity as the net present
value of the future profit stream that can be attributed to the price premium
of the brand. This conception has gained importance in several countries
by the admission of brand equity as a depreciable asset on balance sheets.
In a managerial perspective, the equity of a brand is determined by an
ontologically peculiar set of properties - including brand awareness, brand
loyalty, perceived quality, and brand associations - attached to the outward
presentation of a brand by means of a name, symbol, design, packaging,
or delivery.
<p>Most approaches see the nature of brand equity as revolving around the
relationship between brands and other products in the same competitive
set (Kapferer 1992: ch. 7). What need to be explained, therefore, are the
conditions that demarcate brands from other members of their respective
product class.
<p>Two conceptions of this relationship will be compared and it will be
shown that there are good reasons to accept the ontological reality of
brands as special kinds of products (Section 2). This is followed by an
exposition of the sense in which brands are to be regarded as real (Section
3). The rudiments of an ontology of economic goods, products and brands
will be presented (Section 4), followed by a sketch of an ecology of brands
(Section 5). In the concluding part, the relevance of this model for business,
particularly for understanding brand equity and for strategic brand management
will be discussed (Section 6). Further work will be needed in order to
define the precise ontological structure of brands in formal fashion, to
derive from this the set of necessary and sufficient conditions for successful
branding, and to test the results against empirical data about brand choice,
consumer behavior and the balance sheet asset value of successful brands
(Section 7).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>2. BRANDS: IDEALISM VERSUS REALISM</font></b>
<p><b>2.1. Products and Brands</b>
<p>The relationship between products and brands is a moot area of marketing
science. Most textbooks understand brands to be members of a subset of
products of a particular category such as automobiles or sodas. Brands
are products that are distinguished from others of the same category by
<i>accidental</i>
features such as brand names or design and by the higher awareness and
knowledge that consumers have of them. In this view, brand names stand
for a product category much in the same way that Kleenex, Xerox, Caterpillar
or Rollerblades have come to stand for the product categories of paper
tissues, photocopiers, earth-moving machnies or inline skates.<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of brands is held
to be the higher awareness that consumers have of certain products independently
of their being able to explain from which any real differences such higher
brand awareness arises. According to this view, brands are, in consequence,
reducible to brand names, terms, signs, symbols or designs (Kotler 1997:
443). This implies that brands are not products of a particular nature
but "essentially a seller's promise to deliver a specific set of features,
benefits, and services to the buyers" (<i>ibid</i>). This same account
would, however, apply also to generic products such as the unbranded rice
we buy in a supermarket, which are likely to have a package specifying
only the contents, the net weight and the producer.
<p>Marketing scholars often use the brand concept ambiguously, for example
when they refer to "a Mercedes" (and not to the term 'Mercedes') as a "deep
brand" while at the same time reducing a brand to a set of attributes and
calling a brand a "complex symbol" (Kotler 1997: 443). Obviously an automobile
should not be reduced to a symbol, though certain symbols may of course
help us to distinguish automobiles within their competitive set.<sup><a href="#N_2_">(2)</a></sup>
In this respect it is important to notice that type-token confusions abound
in the literature on brands.<sup><a href="#N_3_">(3)</a></sup> Similarly,
some authors refer to brands themselves as "assets" (Dru 1996: 73) while
others see brand name awareness, brand loyalty, perceived quality, and
brand associations as the "set of assets" (Aaker 1996: 80) that constitute
brand equity. Other authors uphold a dichotomy or, more often, a continuum
between products <i>simpliciter</i> and branded products while at the same
time identifying the <i>differentia specifica</i> of the former as lying
in subjective evaluation, in consumer attitudes such as brand loyalty,
or in the existence of a brand mark. In so doing they underplay the fact
that marketing practice talks of brands as branded products, i.e. as items
within the same category as non-branded products. But they also disregard
the difference that market research draws between brand-level and product-level
investigations, which implies that indeed there are real differences to
be studied.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2.2 Brand Idealism</b>
<p>All views that regard brands as rooted in the perception of consumers
may be collectively classified as <i>idealist</i> conceptions of branding.
They repudiate any definition of products "in ontological terms" (Levitt
1969: 11), i.e. by reference to properties of products, since "the features
that distinguish brands from those of competitors, are invariably held
to be external to the generic products" (<i>ibid.</i>). Instead of looking
for defining characteristics within product space, idealists propose operational
definitions so as to arrive at an "actionable" (<i>ibid.</i>) theory of
brands - a theory with practical consequences for the marketing strategist.
According to a popular version, brands are created by applying marketing
tools, particularly advertising, in such a way as to influence consumer
perception. The underlying assumption is that consumer wants are generally
not for the benefits of core products (such as transport in the case of
automobiles) but for the additional benefits of augmented products (such
as style, image or social recognition). It follows from this view that
any product can potentially be branded or, in an operationalist formulation,
that the conditions for a product to become a brand reside not in product
space but depend only on marketing management. To be a brand, then, ultimately
means to be perceived or known to be a brand or to have been forged into
a brand. Such idealist conceptions still employ the tacit assumption of
a <i>substratum</i> that has been transformed into something-plus. But
they typically assume that "the brand is not a mere indicator of origin,
it is the actual origin of the products to come" (Kapferer 1992: 107).
<p>Brand idealists share their belief in the mental origin of branded products
with Searle's view that 'counting as' is the essence of all social reality.
For Searle, rules of the form '<i>X</i> counts as <i>Y</i> in context <i>C</i>'
constitute the social rather in the way that the rules of chess define
what it means to play chess (Searle 1995: 28). The fact that a product
<i>X</i>
counts as a brand <i>Y</i> within a market <i>C</i> would then be all that
is needed for branding.
<p>Brand idealism is confronted with serious problems however. First, the
language of marketing treats 'brand' and 'product' as intersubstitutible
in many contexts and hence treats brands and products themselves as belonging
to the same level of concreteness. The science of marketing studies brand
choice behavior and assumes, for example, that products are subject to
particular life cycles while brands are (at least potentially) not. This
indicates that, as a matter of fact, brands are treated as a special class
of products, precisely as <i>branded</i> products.
<p>Second, in the case of a commodity purchase such as bread or milk, there
is typically little brand preference even where the products purchased
are in fact branded, as in the case of the well-known Italian dairy producer
Parmalat or its French competitor Danone.<sup><a href="#N_4_">(4)</a></sup>
Nor, as is shown by the case of Chiquita bananas or Perrier water, need
brand strength be correlated with greater competitive advantage. High consumer
awareness may coincide with a much weaker role of this awareness in determining
purchase decisions, which calls into question the overriding role of awareness
in determining the success of branding or in constituting brands in the
first place.
<p>Third, idealism cannot easily accommodate 'natural' (or 'category')
brands such as champagne, cognac, Parma ham or Emmental cheese. In these
cases, brand names did not arise through either individual branding or
umbrella branding (i.e. by being placed under a corporate or a 'blanket'
family name). Moreover, packaging or design is here not consistent and
therefore not constitutive of the brand. In the case of champagne, brand
idealism would imply that the right marketing mix could persuade consumers
to accept wines as champagnes that, as a matter of fact, do not come under
the umbrella of this 'natural' brand. Rather, their belonging to a particular
species of wines, a particular production process ('<i>m&eacute;thode champagnoise</i>')
and their origin in a particular viticultural region characterize certain
wines sufficiently to make them champagnes, regardless of the degree of
awareness consumers may have of them and irrespective of any corporate
brand name (Thode/Maskulka 1998).
<p>Fourth, products often retain a higher value even if they have become
'debranded'. This explains the value of Lacoste shirts without the Lacoste
label, or of Rolex watches stripped of the Rolex name: "They are worth
more than counterfeit imitations, because the brand is present even when
it cannot be seen. In contrast, though the brand may appear on an imitation,
it is actually missing" (Kapferer 1992: 10f.). This phenomenon can only
be explained by assuming that even the former presence of a brand somehow
transforms a product. But this precludes brands from being reduced to a
simple external sign such as a name or label.<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup>
<p>Fifth, it is a fact that in a number of cases a brand can be founded
on the design of products alone. Thus the Swatch<sup>&reg;</sup> brand
uses design to demarcate a range of highly branded watches under a family
umbrella name. Design is, in this case, a necessary condition for being
a Swatch<sup>&reg;</sup>, the sufficient condition being added by the registered
trademark. But it is neither the trademark nor any consumer perception
that creates or constitutes the brand. Similar cases are found among automobiles,
technical appliances and other products with a high degree of product differentiation.
<p>Sixth, brand idealism ultimately leads to the assumption that product
differentiation is induced or created by the marketing mix and particularly
by advertising. If it were only accidental features that differentiate
brands from other products in the same category, then brands should be
able to be created<i> ad libitum</i>. But research demonstrates that not
just any product can, even by applying efficient tools of the marketing
mix, be converted into a brand.<sup><a href="#N_6_">(6)</a></sup> The number
of branding flops is legion and advertising is not the universally powerful
panacea its critics accuse it of being.<sup><a href="#N_7_">(7)</a></sup>
Successful branding must therefore depend on conditions that are rooted
in structures of reality. The existence of "immutable laws of branding"
(Ries/Ries 1998) has been postulated, some of which are rooted in the psychology
of perception and cognition while others may depend on strategic product
management. In the literature on consumer behavior and on cognitive psychology,
the following regularities have, for example, been shown to hold for the
relationship between brands and product categories:
<p>1. The strength or salience of brands within a product category is not
reducible to any single measure of brand performance that can be influenced
by marketing management (Aaker 1996: 356f.; Ehrenberg/Barnard/Scriven 1997).
It is not simply about how strongly users feel about a brand, whether they
value one brand a certain number of times more than another brand, or whether
they have stronger associations with a particular brand.
<p>2. The <i>strength</i> of brands, as measured by the price differential
consumers are willing to accept over other products of the same category,
bears no direct relation to the <i>size</i> of brands as measured by sales
volume or market share (Farr/Hollis 1997; Chong/Ho/Tang 1998). Market niches
can be small but profitable, and the size of dominant brands does not have
to reach a particular share of category sales.<sup><a href="#N_8_">(8)</a></sup>
Since marketing management can typically influence size, this would imply
that, while advertising has a formidable potential of transforming products
into brands, branding must also depend on other than purely operational
conditions (Aaker 1996: 319ff.).
<p>3. Brands can be founded on properties that appear to create a meaningful
product difference but in reality turn out to be irrelevant to creating
that benefit.<sup><a href="#N_9_">(9)</a></sup> A meaningless differentiation
can be valued positively by consumers and can therefore produce a meaningfully
differentiated brand, which indicates that the status of brands is independent
of any meaning they may have for consumers: "Its distinctiveness suggests
its relevance, prompting positive associations, even causal inferences
about its impact on product performance" (Carpenter/Glazer/Nakamoto 1994:
349).
<p>4. Category-brand relations are not symmetrical, i.e. a strong brand-to-category
association (e.g., the Ferrari brand with the category of sports cars)
does not imply a strong category-to-brand association (e.g., the sports
car category does not necessarily activate 'Ferrari' but may also activate
'Porsche' or 'BMW Z') (Tversky/Gati 1978; Farquhar/ Herr/Fazio 1990; Farquhar/Herr
1993; Boush 1993, 1997). Thus, a brand with a strong association toward
the product category is likely to be preferred if no other brand owns the
association from the category. This is the case, for example, for Kleenex
but not for Ferrari.
<p>5. Not all instances of natural kind categories such as 'fruit' or 'bird'
are regarded as equal. Consumers regard apples and peaches, for example,
as more typical exemplars of the category of fruits than pumpkins and olives
(Smith 1989; Estes 1994: 33ff.). If branding relies on typicality within
a category of natural kinds, this category has a structure and does not
permit selection of arbitrary products to be established as successful
brands in just any way.
<p>6. Natural products, including artifacts, represent a more comprehensive
classification of objects than natural kinds, and by including the latter
as a subset many of the characteristics of natural kinds extend to categories
like furniture, clothing or automobiles. In particular, natural products
are perceived to have a graded structure, i.e. to include more or less
typical exemplars or prototypes (Rosch/Mervis 1975; Boush 1993). Consumers
have a rather clear concept of what chairs, automobiles or fruits are like.
Products belonging to natural product categories with features too dissimilar
from those of the prototypes would no longer be regarded as belonging to
the same category. Consequently, consumers use the salience, relevance
and typicality of product attributes to judge brands more favorably.
<p>7. Brand names representative of product attributes are recalled more
often than family brand names and novel names when all are illustrated
with visual cues consistent with the attributes (McCracken/Macklin 1998).
Consumers do not accept attempts to assign arbitrary names or symbols to
products for which they see a clearly demarcated 'slot' in reality. They
require a proper 'fit' of concepts though the exact domain to which the
concept applies may not always be definable by necessary and sufficient
conditions (Keller 1998: 135-46). Even if the referential extension of
the concept 'chair' may be fuzzy in the sense of being extended to bar
stools or to single-pedestal arm chairs, the branding of chairs requires
identity or at least close similarity with the prototypical categorization
of what a chair is (Boush 1997). Congruity of brand names therefore also
affects evaluation of brand name extension to other categories (Herr/Farquhar/Fazio
1996).
<p>8. The core associations connected with a brand have boundaries, which
explains why a brand cannot arbitrarily be extended within (and even less
so across) product categories (Farquhar/Han/Herr/Ijiri 1992; Farquhar/Herr
1993). Consumers know what Coca-Cola is and cannot be tricked into accepting
anything else for the 'real thing'. The perceptual fit of potential brand
extensions to new categories depends on the degree of category dominance
in the original category and on the boundaries that protect the brand.
Since consumers' cognitive representations impose limits on the possibility
of stretching brands it is generally easier to extend brands to closely
related categories than to distantly related categories (Farquhar/Han/Herr/Ijiri
1992; Farquhar/Herr 1993; Batra/ Lehmann/Singh 1993; Nakamoto/MacInnis/Jung
1993; Herr/Farquhar/Fazio 1996; Leong/Ang/Liau 1997; Ries/Ries 1998: 78ff.;
Keller 1998: ch. 12). It is also easier to extend brands to categories
which themselves have a prototypical brand (Han 1998). But the decisive
criterion is the nature of the boundaries.<sup><a href="#N_10_">(10)</a></sup>
The stronger a brand - the more it is a 'master brand' - the smaller tends
to be its extendibility (Farquhar/Han/ Herr/Ijiri 1992). The difference
in plasticity of brands, however, cannot be due only to the application
of a particular set of marketing tools but must also be explained by structures
of the underlying reality of product space that permit extension in some
but not in other cases.
<p>9. Brand names alone affect the demand for a product, and by implication
brand equity, less than is often assumed. Twin automobiles usually made
in the same plant which are physically essentially identical but carry
different brand names have been shown to differ in sales price (Sullivan
1998). But the degree of difference - with an average relative retail price
ratio for the domestic twin pair sample of 0.993 - is close to unity, and
moreover corresponds to the degree of difference between the average prices
of automobile brands of the same category. This suggests that car buyers
use information about parent brand quality to infer the quality of models
under the parent brand. This conclusion would impose limits on the degree
to which individual brands can be leveraged by the application of names
or symbols independently of the leverage derived from a parent master brand.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2.3. Brand Realism</b>
<p>These results of empirical research suffice to show that both product
space and perceptual space are governed by certain regularities, principles
or laws that permit some products of a category to become brands but not
others. There are non-arbitrary, constraining conditions for successful
branding. By consequence, brands cannot simply be reduced to their external
characteristics such as brand names, symbols, trademarks or designs, since
marketing management tools can only be applied successfully if these other
conditions are fulfilled.<sup><a href="#N_11_">(11)</a></sup> Brands, then,
are emergent products that are not reducible to any simple combination
of product properties.
<p>Emergent properties have been defined as such that "belong to a complex
as a whole and not to its parts" (Broad 1925: 23). Brands are not properties
of a mysterious entelechy of products, i.e. of an immanent capacity of
some products to become brands. What constitute brands are properties of
products themselves.<sup> <a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup> Brands are determined
by and are dependent upon properties of product space, without being reducible
to these.
<p>We may express the same idea by saying that brands <i>supervene</i>
on products, much as the mental has been claimed to supervene on the physical
or beauty to supervene on non-aesthetic properties. Supervenience has been
defined as a relationship between sets of properties where one set is only
present in virtue of the presence of the other set (Kim 1993). Similarly,
an object can only have the properties of a supervening brand if it also
has those of an underlying product, without however being reducible to
the latter. If products permit differentiation in terms of properties such
as shape, color, taste, solubility, divisibility or packaging, this defines
the possibilities of branding these products. In the language of Gestalt
theory, brands are <i>founded</i> on products and require special intellectual
acts in order to be grasped by consciousness. They have, in Christian von
Ehrenfels' sense, a higher degree of 'organic unity'. Brands, then, might
be viewed as Gestaltenthat exist in reality.<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>
Brands have a value greater than the sum of their tangible assets, which
explains the phenomenon of brand equity (Murphy 1990: 45; Zaichkowsky 1995:
74ff.). It is the 'closure' of brand elements, their degree of unity and
integration, which facilitates brand awareness, since each piece of information
can act as a retrieval cue for the other. This makes us understand the
extraordinary persistence of 'deep' brands (or 'strong' Gestalten<i>, </i>i.e.
wholes made up of parts other than natural parts). They are more integrated
wholes than weaker brands. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, has managed
to keep its Tide brand as the leader in the laundry detergent category
for more than 50 years.<sup> <a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>
<p>Any such explanation is clearly incompatible with an idealist view.
<i>Brand
realism</i> challenges brand idealism on the basis of what may be called
ecological constraints on branding. It imputes to brands an ontological
reality by treating them as a particular class of products. A weak form
of brand realism is expressed in the definition: "<i>A brand is a product,
then, but one that adds other dimensions to differentiate it in some way
from other products designed to satisfy the same need</i>" (Keller 1998:
4). Here the term 'brand' has to be understood in the comprehensive sense
that includes services, stores (Bloomingdale's, Harrod's, the Waldorf Astoria),
persons (Elvis Presley, Michael Jordan), and places (Burgundy, Nappa Valley).
<p>The ontological position of brand realism may be exemplified by a case
from business history. Since 1901, Gillette has been in the market of grooming
products, producing numerous generations of ever-better razors and pioneering
product innovations. Nonetheless its market leadership was challenged in
1962, when Wilkinson Sword introduced the first razor with a coated, stainless
steel blade. Gillette lost 30 per cent of its wet shaving business over
the next three years until it regained its competitive edge, which was
always founded on product innovation. The market accepted the new Wilkinson
brand, from a company that had hitherto not even been in the shaving business,
because it filled an unoccupied niche, a particular location in product
space which corresponded with - as of yet unfulfilled - consumer demand
for products with a particular combination of properties. On account of
different properties, the category could accommodate at least two brands,
which were, in spite of a degree of overlap, yet still sufficiently differentiated.
<p>According to brand realism, parts of object space have an intrinsic
potential for accommodating brands. Only products that find themselves
in such 'slots' or 'niches' can become brands. Necessary features that
permit branding thus characterize product space, and brands are <i>one-sidedly
dependent</i> on products in the sense of formal ontology (Smith 1982;
Johansson 1989: 131). This tenet is not exposed to what has been described
as the "product-attribute fixation trap" (Aaker 1996: 72), since it does
not reduce brands to product attributes. Realism about brands does not
require product fixation. In particular, it does not imply the assumption
of metaphysical essentialism, which in the present context would amount
to the claim that there are necessary and sufficient conditions for a brand
to be dominant within a category. Brands are conceived to be products that
are salient within their category by being demarcated from other less-branded
ones by defensible boundaries. A defensible position is one which remains
viable even after subsequent competitive entry. Defensibility can be a
function of unique properties of products, control over distribution channels,
advertising expenditure or, in the strongest case, a function of licenses,
patents, trademarks or recognized designations of origin.<sup><a href="#N_15_">(15)</a></sup>
<p>For the realist, consequently, brand equity is a function of the degree
to which brands succeed in occupying <i>niches</i> within product categories.
A niche is that into which a brand fits, much like a species occupies an
ecological niche. The specific nature of such niches is defined by a combination
of properties of products and factors pertaining to the way these are perceived
and evaluated by consumers. The latter, subjective factors such as brand
image, do play an important role, but they do not constitute brands since
they themselves are founded on them: "A true brand is one whose image is
embodied in the product characteristics" (Kapferer 1992: 139).
<p>Realism about brands does not imply a causal dependence. The fact that
there would be no branded products if features of these products had not
been set into relief or if marketing tools had not been applied does not
entail the causal dependence of brands on acts of the mind or on marketing
management. Manipulability is sufficient but not necessary for existence.
It is the entry into causal interactions that has been well established
for brands, independently of and differently from generic products, that
justifies ontological commitment to such 'higher-level' entities.
<p>Brand realism is compatible with the idealist claims that it is the
augmented product, through the application of names, symbols, and advertising,
that turns unbranded products into brands, and that products are of interest
for marketing only to the extent of being actionable. Realism need only
assume a one-sided dependence of brands on products, which implies that
marketing tools can, sometimes unawares, at least partially de-brand a
product again.<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup> But they cannot change
features of the underlying product that would afford re-branding. Brands
are, in this sense,
<i>grounded</i> in products.<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
Thus the Hallmark brand is grounded in three different classes of characteristics
of the underlying product: essential characteristics (gift-associated,
high quality), contributing (but non-essential) characteristics (combination
of pictures and words), and accidental characteristics (made of paper).
The Hallmark brand supervenes on several different product types (greeting
cards, gift-wrapping, posters, plaques, party accessories, Christmas ornaments),
with greeting cards clearly being the brand prototype (Boush 1993).
<p>Branded products represent exemplars within their categories: "In certain
markets, a brand personifies the product category. It is its prototype"
(Kapferer 1992: 139). For a long time, the IBM Personal Computer and the
Apple Macintosh have been the relevant prototypes among computers. They
defined 'platforms' or standards for a range of hardware and software products.
Empirical research shows that typicality of category members always depends
on feature salience (Boush 1993: 306). The easiest brand for consumers
to accept is one in which typicality is based on a few related salient
features. This is the case not only for Hallmark, Levis and Coca-Cola but
also for Sony, originally a family umbrella name and now a corporate name
that sets the standard in categories such as that of multi-band short-wave
radios or CD players. Walkman<sup>&reg;</sup>, as a registered trademark
of Sony, has established itself as a master brand and has come to be used
as a category designation. Identification with a prototype within a category
thus enhances the potential for branding. But in the case of Sony products,
too, the brand is founded on a few common properties such as hi-tech (and
often 'futuristic') design, miniaturization, dedication to quality, and
technological lead.
<p>Brand realists will also concede to idealists that, everything else
being equal, consumers will choose the brand of which they are most aware
or towards which they possess the most favorable attitude. But they doubt
that the <i>ceteris paribus</i> condition typically holds in cases of product
differentiation, since the conditions for alternative products to occupy
a certain niche depend on the structure of reality, both on features of
products and on the functioning of our cognitive processes. Furthermore,
brand realism can make many assumptions about constructs such as brand
identity, brand personality, brand organization, brand value and brand
symbols redundant by raising the issue of ontological dependence. If a
product category is structured in such a way that it admits of one brand
with defensible boundaries, whether these derive from the type of product
or from a copyright or trademark, other operational methods of leveraging
the brand may be unnecessary. If, on the other hand, a product category
admits of several overlapping niches, marketing management will generally
contribute towards a stronger differentiation and thus a higher leverage
for the competing brands. In both cases brands are more than products (Aaker
1996: 72): they are dominant members of a product class characterized by
emerging properties. Similarly, a melody as a Gestalt supervenes on a sequence
of notes but both in traditional harmony and in dodecaphonic music only
a combination of certain notes has the potential of becoming a melody.
This is well corroborated by Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg's theory of musical
coherence and categorization as well as by recent work on the cognitive
structure of musical perception (Narmour 1990; Kendall/Carterette 1996).
<p>It follows from this account that 'brand' is not a theoretical construct
belonging to the metalanguage of marketing. Much like membrane bounds,
tectonic plates, quasars, phonemes or melodies, brands are postulated as
existing in the object domain rather than solely in conceptual space.
<p>An advertising practitioner has, without metaphysical sophistication,
best described the brand concept: "A brand is more than a product; it's
both a physical and perceptual entity […] The physical aspect of a brand
(its product and packaging) can be found sitting on the supermarket shelf
(or wherever). It is mostly static and finite. However, the perceptual
aspect of a brand exists in psychological space - in the consumer's mind.
It is dynamic and malleable" (Randazzo 1995: 6).<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>
Brands, then, can depend "both on perception of differences in the product
itself and on any claims made on behalf of the product as to function and
performance" (Alderson 1957: 270). But the latter are in turn dependent
on the former since there must be structures of product space for anything
to be perceived or set into relief at all.
<p>The realist view of branding may be illustrated by a famous marketing
mistake. When in 1985 Coca-Cola decided to change its formula and developed
'New Coke' with a sweeter and smoother taste, consumers worldwide overwhelmingly
rejected it. By changing the taste of the beverage the company tried to
relocate the niche within the category of colas that Coca-Cola has traditionally
enjoyed. However, consumers were not willing to accept the new product
as a Coca-Cola, a brand that took up a well-defined position in their minds,
i.e. with which they associated a set of well-defined properties. Many
believed that the distance to the niche occupied by Pepsi, a brand which
is often considered to be sweeter, had been reduced and that an overlap
of the two niches had been brought about where consumers wanted these niches
to be discrete. The sugar content in the chemical composition of colas
may vary, and there may be a continuous gradation of other objective features.
But consumer expectations, however these may have been formed, permit the
category of colas to contain two niches, depending on a combination of
features such as sweetness, color, and content of carbon dioxide.<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>
In addition, the classic shape of the hourglass bottle, to which the company
has increasingly returned, strengthens the identity of the brand. Advertising
that, in the case of Coke, emphasizes the 'real thing' while Pepsi tries
to appeal to a younger audience and stresses excitement may, of course,
enhance the specific position of Coca-Cola and Pepsi in consumers' minds.
But the brand image created by advertising is founded on - or grounded
in - the causal relation between features of products and how these are
perceived. Here, again, we see the relation of the one-sided dependence
of brands on products. If the niches of Coca-Cola and Pepsi overlap beyond
an acceptable threshold, dilution of the brands occurs, and this is what
has happened in 1985. Today 'Coke Classic', the legitimate successor to
the original brand, captures 20.6 per cent of the U.S. soft drink market
(on a brand basis), outselling Pepsi-Cola by 6.1 per cent, while 'Coke
II', which evolved out of the 'New Coke', held a miniscule 0.1 per cent
and was withdrawn from the market. Private labels reach a cumulative share
of 2.7 per cent of the relevant market, with a drop in sales volume from
1996 to 1997 by 13.6 per cent.<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>3. THE REALITY OF BRANDS</b>
<p><b>3.1. Affordances of Brands</b>
<p>If brands have an ontological reality, the exact nature of this reality
remains yet to be clarified. The realist account does not imply a purely
physicalist demarcation of brands from other products nor does it imply
the view that products become branded at the behest of processes of perception
or cognition. Such a view would presuppose a Cartesian dualism between
<i>res
cogitans</i> and <i>res extensa</i> which has long ago become obsolete
in cognitive science. Much along the lines of Gibson's ecological model
of perception, brand realism treats the structures of our cognitive apparatus
as part of the same reality to which products belong (Gibson 1982). The
salient question, then, is what kinds of products can be branded at all,
given the characteristics of our cognitive system.
<p>The conditions for branding need not even reside in presently perceived
or existing properties of products: "every product has more attributes
than meet the eye" (MacMillan/McGrath 1996: 58). Branding strategies cannot
be based only on the particular taste, shape, consistency or perceived
quality of a product but they must relate also to real (or <i>de re</i>)
possibilities - to the dispositional properties - of products to enable
certain uses or to permit certain transformations that have not yet been
undertaken. Gibson referred to such possibilities as 'affordances', in
the sense that a chair affords sitting, fire affords warmth or products
of the same category afford the same use while one product may afford multiple
usage. The <i>affordance</i> of an object is a certain invariant of the
environment. It is independent of any of the needs and dispositions of
an observer and can therefore not be influenced. Affordances do not cause
behavior but rather constrain or control it. They are not the outcomes
of perceptual processes, as 'meanings' are often held to be (Gibson 1982:
411). Affordances, sets of potentials or capacities of products, exist
objectively, as part of product space, though they may not yet have been
realized or acted upon. In the context of marketing, they define the necessary
but not yet sufficient conditions for successful branding.
<sup><a href="#N_21_">(21)</a></sup>
<p>Because of the relational character of affordances, we need to tie them
to the action repertoire of agents. A television set no more affords viewing
(but only listening) to a blind person than a hammer affords hitting to
a creature without manipulators. Moreover, the affordances of an object
are context-dependent. A television set does not afford viewing when enclosed
in a box; a hammer does not afford hitting in a room without agents that
might use it (Kirsh 1995). Affordances are therefore context-sensitive,
which is of little problem for the realist.
<p>Product engineering has long used affordances to describe the potential
of products to assume certain functions. Physical properties of objects
are designed to constrain certain actions - car boot lids and engine bonnets
are obvious examples - or to suggest a range of possible actions (Norman
1988). A button with a concave surface invites pressing, while a cylindrical
knob suggests grasping and rotation. Flashing hold buttons on telephones
afford attention. Well-designed products contain visible cues for use.<sup><a href="#N_22_">(22)</a></sup>
In this sense, information is in the world, to be picked up by users, in
the sense in which Gibson understood the process of perception (Smith 1999a).
In branding we utilize the affordances of objects to provide signals about
special functions, higher quality, uniqueness, or value.
<p>Generic products (private labels, store brands), too, are defined by
characteristics of their product categories. But here it is not affordances
rooted in products themselves but rather functional aspects that drive
category share. Low variability in quality, easy production from commodity
ingredients, large product category sales, low national advertising expenditures
and intensive distribution networks are some of the conditions under which
private labels will prosper (Quelch/Harding 1996; Hoch/Lodish 1998). These
characteristics are rather associated with cost structures (e.g., production
technology, particularly economies of scale), with conditions of product
and factor markets, and with marketing management, than with properties
of products themselves.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>3.2. Essentialism vs. Naturalism</b>
<p>This conception of brands does not imply metaphysical essentialism.
Aristotle showed that the possibility of using the same thing for different
purposes does not impute to it different essences (<i>Met. </i>1030<sup>a</sup>5ff.).
One and the same stuffed piece of cloth can be a pin pad, a paperweight
or, if branded and trademarked, a Beanie Baby<sup>&reg;</sup>. In order
to turn a stuffed piece of cloth into a Beanie Baby<sup>&reg;</sup>, however,
certain objective criteria must be fulfilled. In addition to these necessary
conditions on product space, successful branding will depend on the application
of marketing tools such as brand name, design, trademark, packaging, and
advertising. But the fact that brands are set into relief in virtue of
structures of the perceptual system does not make them <i>dependent for
their existence</i> upon human perceivers or the application of any methods
of marketing: "We discover which aspects of what we perceive have to be
assigned to the sensory system only by identifying in the object the intrinsic
features to which the senses are responding. Thus at every stage of the
investigation, knowledge of how the senses function presupposes knowledge
about the objects they respond to" (Kelley 1986: 43).
<p>The problem then boils down to that of giving a <i>naturalistic</i>,
or an <i>ecological</i>, account of branding rather than to the distinction
between 'subjective' and 'objective' aspects of this process.<sup><a href="#N_23_">(23)</a></sup>
Not just any product can, by virtue of the creation of an external brand
identity via appropriate use of the marketing mix, attain such a high awareness
in the consideration set of consumers that it may be classified as a brand.
Thus it may well be possible to brand even sand (Hill/McGrath/Dayal 1998).
However, since sand is a commodity that permits little product differentiation,
even the application of quality control, packaging and customization is
unlikely to afford the establishment of a master brand. Any brand identity
that can be achieved, in such a case, will be a function not only of product
features such as granularity or the content of microorganisms but will
also be a function of the marketing mix (e.g. of a combination of packaging,
price, name etc.).<sup><a href="#N_24_">(24)</a></sup> On the other hand,
Evian is such a powerful brand that it sells for a 20 per cent higher price
than Budweiser and for 80 per cent more than Coca-Cola (Ries/Ries 1998:
6f.). As table water, it has few salient product features apart from chemical
and microbiological purity on which to found a brand. But consumer perception
has permitted a combination of physical and intellectual features (including
the images of France and of the Alps) to occupy a niche in its category
that is remarkably defensible. Moreover, on many markets Evian has succeeded
to establish itself as a product prototype and has become the leading table
water.
<p>It follows from this conception that constructs such as brand identity,
brand personality or brand meaning cannot be constitutive of brands. It
may well be that "a brand gives products their meaning and direction" (Kapferer
1992: 13). But it can do so only within the limits defined by the affordances
of products: "In categorization terms, a brand (or any other cue) has meaning
(validity) when it is relatively consistent within category members and
distinctive from members of other categories" (Boush 1993: 307). The meaning
of a brand is then a function of its typicality and of the degree to which
it occupies a discrete niche. This definition may therefore well be seen
as lying within the ambit of brand realism: "Though we can accept that
the brand starts with a product, it is not the product: the brand is the
sense, the meaning of the product" (Kapferer 1992: 117f.). In other words,
the brand supervenes on the product, or is founded on it.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>3.3. Function and Existence</b>
<p>In a broader perspective, the realist must reject all claims that perceiving
or interpreting products in a particular way, or assigning special functions
to them, constitutes the ontological reality of markets. Such a view would
follow from Searle's belief that the function of an object is not intrinsic
to its materiality but is assigned by someone. The brand realist has no
problem admitting that someone assigns the function of a product in the
sense of determining its concrete use. But he will insist that its material
nature affords a certain range of possible functions and not another. It
is, therefore, not the principle '<i>X</i> counts as <i>Y</i> in context
<i>C</i>'
that defines - let alone creates - social objects. This would imply that
the collective acceptance of just any product as a brand would make it
a brand and that brands are but observer relative objects (Searle 1995:
12). But the realist can subscribe to what has been referred to as Searle's
'principle of constitution': '<i>X</i> constitutes
<i>Y</i> in context
<i>C</i>' (Meijer 1998). This principle explains how higher-order properties
emerge and how they can be real while at the same time being irreducible.
But it expresses nothing more than the realist claim that in certain contexts
brands supervene on underlying products. It does not yet permit to define
the topology or the ecology of product space.
<p>Searle defines his social ontology by way of the following propositions
(Searle 1995: 10):
<p>"1. The sheer existence of the physical object in front of me does not
depend on
<p>any attitudes we may take toward it.
<p>2. It has many features that are intrinsic in the sense that they do
not depend on
<p>any attitudes of observers or users. For example, it has a certain mass
and a
<p>certain chemical composition.
<p>3. It has other features that exist only relative to the intentionality
of agents. For
<p>example, it is a screwdriver. […] Observer-relative features are ontologically
<p>subjective.
<p>4. Some of these ontologically subjective features are epistemically
objective.
<p>5. For example, it isn't just my opinion or evaluation that it is a
screwdriver. It is a matter of objectively ascertainable fact that it is
a screwdriver.
<p>6. Although the feature of being a screwdriver is observer relative,
the feature of thinking that something is a screwdriver (treating it as
a screwdriver, using it as a screwdriver, etc.) is intrinsic to the thinkers
(treaters, users, etc.). Being a screwdriver is observer relative, but
the features of the observers that enable them to create such observer-relative
features of the world are intrinsic features of the observers […]"
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Applied to consumer behavior and to the domain of brands, the realist
accepts propositions 1. and 2. Product properties do not depend on consumer
wants or attitudes since these wants manifest themselves only "<i>after</i>
production decisions have placed opportunities before consumers" (Kirzner
1973: 176). But the realist must repudiate the ontological subjectivity
of brands and can accept 3. only on the understanding that intentional
states of observers with regard to objects do not arise
<i>ex</i> <i>nihilo</i>,
or at the behest of observers, but are afforded, warranted or made possible
by features of product space. Rather than preexisting in a vacuum, "consumer
wants are modified by the very process of production supposedly designed
to cater to them" (<i>ibid</i>.). The realist agrees with 4. and can accept
proposition 5. if the features of observers that permit branding are conceived
in a naturalistic way, i.e. as part of the same reality to which products
and brands belong (N&uacute;&ntilde;ez 1995).<sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup>
For the realist, the ontological emergence of brands finds its counterpart
in the epistemological domain: our knowledge of brands is more comprehensive
than our knowledge of products of the same category.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4. TOWARD A CATEGORIAL ONTOLOGY</b>
<p><b>4.1. Levels of Competition</b>
<p>Marketing regards objects under the aspect of their utility for consumers.
Primary commodities, produced goods and services, including those goods
and services that are factors of production, are, by virtue of the relative
scarcity of their supply, economic goods which are traded on markets. Marketing
as a discipline investigates, and marketing management seeks to influence,
the processes by which these goods become <i>products</i>. They do this
by assuming a specific utility for consumers. Products, then, are economic
goods that have the capacity to produce the satisfaction of a want or a
need (Kotler 1995: 430).
<p>Products fall into product categories by virtue of the functional utility
they have for consumers, i.e. whether consumers use them for food, transport,
entertainment, information etc. There are automobiles, wines and candy,
and within these categories one may distinguish subcategories such as sports
cars, sparkling wines and chocolate bars. In many cases, products are complementary
bundles of goods and services, such as meals in restaurants, air transport,
or the auditing of financial statements.
<p>Many products in these categories are <i>brands</i> such as Ferrari,
champagne, Colgate and Hershey. All brands are therefore products but not
all products are branded. There are product categories, particularly those
of natural kinds such as rice, potatoes or lettuce, where generic products
predominate, though there is also 'Uncle Ben's' rice and there are Idaho
potatoes.<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup> In other product categories,
such as those of automobiles, technical appliances or mineral water, all
products may at the same time be brands. The less differentiated a product
can be - or, in ontological terms: the fewer constituent moments can be
identified in the corresponding whole - the less it affords branding (Smith
1982).
<p>Some brands are 'natural' (or category) brands with a geographical or
historical identity, e.g. champagne, cognac, Parma ham, Louis XVI furniture,
or Georgian architecture. Others are corporate brands such as Ferrari,
Chippendale furniture or Hershey's chocolate bars. With category brands,
the adjective-noun composite as in 'Venetian glass' does not consist of
two independent concepts of which one modifies the other. This is the case
in the composite 'red apple', where 'red' is the modifier and 'apple' is
the header (Murphy 1988). Venetian glass is one type of glass distinguished
by color and form, similar rather to Granny Smith or Mackintosh apples
than to red apples.
<p>In markets characterized by product differentiation competition can
occur on several levels, where at least those of products, brands, and
product forms must be distinguished. The relevant market is usually defined
by the substitutability of competing elements in the consideration set
of consumers. Products may then be said to compete at various levels depending
on consumer purpose (Guillinan 1993; Sudharshan 1995: ch. 4). For example,
a particular brand of toothpaste (say, Crest) may compete with another
brand (say, Colgate) at the lowest-but-one level, since subbrands of these
brands (e.g., spearmint-flavored variants) may compete at the level of
product forms (or of branded variants). At a higher level, that of product
categories, toothpaste may compete with other dental hygiene products such
as tooth powders or, at a yet higher level, with 'mouth fresheners' (e.g.,
breath mints). Similarly a coffee brand may come in caffeinated and decaffeinated
variants. This competition, which is driven by consumer needs for products
fulfilling a similar purpose, has been termed 'generic competition' (Kotler
1995: 230).
<p>These are the levels of competition that are of relevance specifically
for marketing. In an even wider sense, of course, all economic goods compete
for the budget of consumers. In the case of product forms, the competitive
set of, for example, Diet Cola, comprises Diet Pepsi and other reduced
calorie colas, while as a product the 'deep' brand Coca Cola competes with
other colas, whether they are more branded or less. On yet broader levels,
colas compete with other sodas, with soft drinks, and lastly with beverages.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4.2. Substances and Accidents</b>
<p>Within the framework of a broadly Aristotelian ontology (Smith 1997;
Smith 1999b), products such as apples, chairs or CD players would be substances
while services such as financial auditing, the mixing of drinks, lecturing,
or haircuts, are accidents - in this case processes which unfold in time.<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>
It is events and processes, not substances or 'things', which have temporal
parts. Together with qualities, processes are accidents that are one-sidedly
dependent upon substances (<i>Met</i>. 1040<sup>b</sup>5-16, 1041<sup>b</sup>28-31,
1052<sup>a</sup>22ff., 1070<sup>b</sup>36-1071<sup>a</sup>4; <i>Cat.</i>
1<sup>b</sup>5).
<p><i>Prima facie</i> it might seem that the only attributes or benefits
on which - at least personal or 'embodied' - services can be differentiated
are speed, reliability and efficiency of delivery. Service marketing has
gone much beyond that and recognizes that one point of differentiation
lies in the integration of substances in the process of service delivery.
One of the most successful strategies of marketing personal services is
to increase the physical evidence, or to provide tangible cues to consumers,
whether in the form of facility layout or of corporate design (Zeithaml/Bitner
1996: ch. 18). Just like brands are founded on products, all services are
lastly founded on substances. Substances <i>individuate</i> the accidents
which inhere in them, to make them the entities they are (<i>Cat</i>. 2<sup>b</sup>1ff.).
This explains why (personal) services are non-homogeneous. Services are
individuated <i>a priori</i>, which raises particular challenges for the
establishment of service brands (Keller 1998: 612ff.).
<p>Substances are, in virtue of their causal powers, grouped together into
natural kinds or species. Product categories such as coffee - but not products
or brands such as Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee - would correspond to such
species. In each such category, it is possible to distinguish typical or
standard instances, together with a penumbra of non-typical instances.
Non-branded generic products are roughly what Aristotle regarded as non-typical
instances while brands are classes of typical instances of the product
category to which they belong. They are characterized by their <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i>
- or, for want of a better translation, their salience - within a category.
Gestalt psychologists have stressed that <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> is in fact
ambiguous as between, on the one hand, a tendency to regularity or lawfulness
in our perception and, on the other hand, a feature or features of the
objects themselves that would afford such perception (Kanizsa/Luccio 1986;
Smith 1988: 61ff.). A product which enjoys this property is 'marked' and
is a 'good example of its type', but it is also 'full', 'well-rounded'
and 'integral' in the sense of being a more 'organic' whole.<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup>
To a large extent, Kellogg's corn flakes, on account of their nutritional
value, crispness and taste, have become the standard of corn flakes. They
possess a higher degree of 'organic unity', and the brand name Kellogg's
"stands as guarantor of their quality and taste" (Kapferer 1992: 164).
<i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i>
is a matter of degrees, which corresponds to the existence of more or less
branded products, or of stronger and weaker brands. Store brands (or private
labels) have properties that are less salient for consumers. It may be
conjectured that what has been described as the 'identity' or the 'values'
of brands is largely their <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i>, their degree of 'closure'
and integration (Kapferer 1992: 31ff., 74; Dru 1996: 115; Aaker 1996: 68ff.,
201ff.). It permits a cognitive processing of brands on which brand equity
is founded.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4.3. Parts and Wholes</b>
<p>Differentiation of levels of competition has sometimes led to the assumption
that products are composed of 'atoms' or 'elements' in the sense of set
theory. Some composite products are indeed such that they consist of proper
parts (or substances), such as an automobile and its tires.<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup>
However, consumer demand is for the automobile as a functional unit, which
it would not be without tires. Even composite products cannot be conceived
of as a nesting of proper parts in the sense of independent elements constituting
a whole.
<p>It has been suggested that consumer demand is actually not directed
at products as such but rather at their characteristics (or properties)
such as size, color, shape, texture, or flavor. Consumer theory has thus
been reconstructed in terms of property space rather than product space
(Lancaster 1971). In an extension of Lancaster's model, hedonic price analysis
uses multiple regression methods to determine functional relationships
between market prices and properties of rival products. This model underlies
the various models of functional (or benefit) segmentation and of positioning.
Decomposition of products into attributes as their elements constitutes
the basis for perceptual maps and attribute-based multivariate methods
in market research, such as those used in factor analysis, cluster analysis
and conjoint analysis.<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup>
<p>The properties of products can potentially be identified and measured
independently of the purchase decision. Distances between attributes in
product space may also explain why a red car and a blue car are close substitutes
while a red car and a red apple are not. But this is so not just because
the cars share many attributes, but rather because certain attributes are
the important ones for most people who desire cars. If this were not so,
a bicycle with a wheel missing would be a moderately close substitute for
one without. In the absence of a functional assumption, there is danger
that a product will simply reduce to its attributes, which would then be
treated assumption, there is danger that a product will simply reduce to
the set of its attributes, which would then be treated as its component
parts.<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup> On this ontological issue realists
must therefore part company with Lancaster's model, since they cannot accept
any such reducibility.
<p>Not only are consumers unlikely to have similar marginal rates of substitution
between properties, i.e. they do not value properties alike, but products
are also not reducible to a simple set of properties which are independent
of each other. If this were possible it would indeed be difficult to distinguish
between products which are highly branded and such which are not. In Lancaster's
model, higher consumer valuation of particular properties can only be expressed
as a higher willingness to pay. But in complex products with a number of
relevant properties the willingness to pay for one property also depends
on the number and the monetary valuation of other properties. Some properties
may be such, as in the case of shoes without soles or computers without
processors, that our willingness to pay for any other of their properties
is reduced to zero if one property is missing or found deficient. Brand
equity resides in the very fact that properties of particular products
are not only salient for consumers - an assumption that may still be accommodated
in Lancaster's model - but that they are highly integrated and represent
prototypes of their respective products. 'New Coke' was not rejected because
of its perceived sweetness but because the brand as a whole, its Gestalt,
had changed. Brands, by contrast to products, are 'moored' in niches and
resist change.
<p>If brands are wholes, their properties are accidents - rather than parts
- in the Aristotelian sense. They inhere in the whole and cannot be separated
from it, whereas the parts of a substance are themselves substances (<i>Met</i>.
1028<sup>b</sup>9-120). Coca-Cola, for instance, is not a product that
just happens to be a brown beverage. Its color is, in this case, even a
necessary property of the product, as the failed attempt to produce a colorless
cola ('Crystal Pepsi') has well documented. Properties intrinsic to the
product (e.g. solubility, acidity, texture or color) but also brand names,
logos, design, or packaging enter into a complex whole the identity of
which can no longer be dissociated into individual elements (Kapferer 1992:
5). In the naturalistic view held by brand realism no difference is made
between 'internal' or 'external' properties: "some attributes are intrinsic
to the physical product itself, whereas others are defined by the way a
segment of customers uses the product" (MacMillan/McGrath 1996: 62).
<p>Instead of belonging to atomistically structured domains, then, brands
belong to a mereological world of part-whole relations, connections and
boundaries (Smith 1995; Smith/Varzi 1999a). This is the world described
in Gibson's ecological psychology, particularly in his theory of surface
layout (Smith 1999a). The properties of brands stand in relations of dependence
on other properties, and a change of some properties may constitute a new
product while a change of others may not. Product forms or subbrands must
therefore not be assumed to be a 'lower' level of competition since competition
between, say, spearmint-flavored and peppermint-flavored chewing gums is
a competition between instances of a brand such as Wrigley and not between
spearmint and peppermint. Products, and <i>a fortiori</i> brands, are wholes
which are neither ontologically nor economically reducible.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>4.4. Boundaries</b>
<p>Products, as substances that take up space and endure through time,
exist within certain boundaries. Products are typically scattered or separated
in product space, i.e. there are different well-demarcated products belonging
to a category. The outer boundary of a particular kind of sausage, whether
branded or not, is within the boundary of the product category of sausages,
which in turn is within that of meat products. Boundaries between products
exist in a real and physical sense - products can be sliced, transported
and packaged. Those products which are embodied services - such as haircuts,
surgery or financial auditing - have their boundary defined by the agent,
who can interrupt delivery of a service, move the location of delivery
etc.
<p>Boundaries can generally be of either of two types: <i>bona fide</i>
boundaries are those that correspond to genuine (spatio-temporal) discontinuities
in the world while <i>fiat</i> boundaries are projected into the world
wholly or partly independently of such discontinuities. Bona fide boundaries
obtain in the things themselves; they comprise cases of qualitative heterogeneity
(of fabric, texture, electrical charge etc.) among the parts of a whole
(Smith 1995; Smith/Varzi 1999a). Whether commodities, artifacts or services
- all products are such that their outer boundaries are surfaces.<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup>
<p>Boundaries between products within a category, too, can be of a bona
fide or a fiat nature. A distinguishing feature of bona fide boundaries
is that they are necessarily part of the entities they bound (Smith/Varzi
1999a). The package of a product is thus an integral part of the (augmented)
product. This implies that brands, as differentiated products, equally
have bona fide boundaries and are therefore bona fide objects.
<p>Branding products involves a change of boundaries. Product differentiation
can consist in breaking a product down into smaller (physical) units, combining
these with another product, redesigning a product, packaging a composite
product and making it available to consumers at new locations. Altering
the quality or composition of a product, by changing its color, granularity,
fabric or smell also imposes bona fide boundaries of an internal nature.
Adding hazelnuts to a milk chocolate changes the internal composition of
a chocolate bar, though size and package may remain unaltered. It thus
affords the establishment of a new brand or subbrand. Marketing management
utilizes the affordance of a product to be divided, recombined and qualitatively
altered and imposes external or internal boundaries (including, for example,
new distribution channels for consumers).
<p>The difference between branded and non-branded products is, then, often
of a bona fide nature. In a physical sense, Classic Coke and a private
label cola are two substances divided by bona fide internal and external
boundaries - they are not only qualitatively heterogeneous but are contained
by different packages and therefore occupy different spatio-temporal locations.
<p>But branding may also be founded on the imposition of fiat boundaries,
e.g. in cases where proper parts are delineated within the interior of
larger wholes. Gestalt theory would predict that the strength of the whole
is inversely related to the 'naturalness' of its parts, since a 'weak'
Gestalt is defined as consisting of proper parts (Smith 1988). Wholes characterized
by less unity and
<i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> will then rather have fiat than
bona fide boundaries.
<p>The use of trademarks or copyrights to protect brands is such an instrument
for carving out fiat wholes.<sup><a href="#N_33_">(33)</a></sup> But the
reliance on fiat measures of product policy always presupposes the existence
of bona fide brands in the first place, since intellectual property rights
can only be established where real discontinues and distinctions exist:
"Worthy of protection is the uniqueness or singularity of coined marks,
not value acquired merely through advertising" (Martino 1996: 26). The
drawing of fiat boundaries therefore only has a supplementary or derivative
function. It increases the defensibility of a niche but does not define
its width or depth.
<p>Fiat objects are also not any less 'real' than bona fide objects. They
are different only <i>qua</i> being entities delineated by decisions. The
decision to draw a boundary where it is drawn is due to associated real
properties of the relevant factual material which, in the sense of Gibson,
afford the drawing of such boundaries. As demarcated in 'mesoscopic' (or
table-top) reality, fiat products are in every case linked to bona fide
objects of comparable scale on which they supervene. In the world of mesoscopic
scale to which products belong it is the interiors of a thing which are
salient for purposes of categorization and of branding, and internal boundaries
are often of a fiat nature.
<p>In the case of services, again, the nature of boundaries becomes more
complex. A holiday in a Club M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e is a complex whole
which, as a service package chosen from a tour operator's catalogue, is
composed of a definite number of material and immaterial parts. However,
independently of the specific combination selected by consumers, what is
included in a holiday package depends on the drawing of fiat boundaries.
The complex whole that is a holiday in a Club M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e
is itself created by the conjoining of multiple parts and may include bona
fide objects within it. But as such its boundaries are of a fiat nature
without thereby imperiling its potential to become a brand. The whole package
that is sold as one branded product supervenes on its components (e.g.,
hotel accommodation, air transport, meals, etc.) in the sense that the
fixation of relevant properties at the lower level of individual components
(e.g., the category of hotel or quality of transportation) suffices to
fix the values of properties at the higher level of the composite product.
Similarly, the consumer want is for surgery, as a complex bundle of services,
not for surgeons, lancets, operating theaters, nurses, or aneasthesia.
All of these elements enter into a whole the external boundaries of which
are of a fiat nature.<sup><a href="#N_34_">(34)</a></sup>
<p>Between product categories fiat boundaries obtain, since the question
of what the domain of sausages encompasses cannot, as essentialists would
have it, be answered by reference to physical discontinuities alone. But
fiat boundaries do not imply arbitrary delineations of object space. Exemplars
or prototypes, in Aristotle's sense of typical instances, define the extension,
or possible circumference, of a product category, albeit without precision.
The boundaries of categories are not imposed by the human mind, they derive
from our structures of categorization, particularly our perception of typicality
and similarity (Smith, E.E. 1989; Estes 1994). Marketing strategy can only
leverage brand equity by setting the boundaries of brands into relief (Farquhar/Han/Herr/Ijiri
1992).
<p>Product markets, i.e. the sets of products that serve a certain need
of a certain market segment, always depend upon delineation, i.e. they
have fiat boundaries.<sup><a href="#N_35_">(35)</a></sup> Analysts impose
segments, and the 'goodness of fit' of these segments largely depends on
the method chosen (Wedel/Kamakura 1997). Boundaries are largely of a functional
nature: "The concept of product-market boundaries is, therefore, strongly
interrelated to the notion of the types and forms of effective competition"
(Sudharshan 1995: 104).<sup><a href="#N_36_">(36)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>5. TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF BRANDS</b>
<p>Brands are part of an ecology of products in which products become branded
and de-branded, product and brand extension occurs, products and brands
disappear from the market, new products enter, and brands 'cannibalize'
one another. A number of central concepts of population ecology - species,
niche, ecosystem, competition etc. - can be fruitfully applied in marketing
theory for making sense of these phenomena.
<p>The concept of an ecological niche has repeatedly been applied to marketing
(Milne 1990; Milne/Mason 1989, 1994). In the "ecology of products", as
opposed to that of natural species, products "do not survive by laws of
natural selection, but are selected for survival because they find a place
in human minds and living patterns" (Alderson 1957: 270). By analogy with
the survival of firms in competition, products can establish themselves
in niches if they fulfil three such principles: 1. the niches they occupy
endure because they are <i>prolific</i>; 2. they have a (stable)
<i>core</i>
and a <i>fringe</i>; 3. they are <i>plastic</i> in the sense of being able
to assume new functions through image transfer and brand extension (Alderson
1957: 55ff.). Whether a niche is prolific depends, first and foremost,
on total demand for the product category, i.e. on achievable profit per
unit. However, the more prolific a niche is, the more the brand that occupies
it is likely to become subject to attacks by competitors. The core of every
niche determines the competitive advantage of the brand and, by extension,
the degree to which its boundaries are defensible. The relationship between
the core and the fringe (i.e. niche width) imposes, depending on the relative
elasticity of the niche, limits on the extendability of brands.
<p>In population ecology, a niche is understood as an <i>n</i>-dimensional
hypervolume of ecological space, i.e. as a set of points along <i>n</i>
axes that represent the conditions under which a species can survive (Hutchinson
1978: 158). It is a functional attribute of a species and not a spatial
unit. Hence niche, which defines the role of a species in a community,
is different from habitat, which simply refers to its location in a community.
<p>For purposes of marketing, a niche would then be an <i>n</i>-dimensional
hypervolume in product category space, where <i>n</i> designates the number
of properties used in the consumer evaluation of products. By analogy with
the species concept, which corresponds to product categories rather than
products, a niche defines the conditions for brands to establish themselves
dependent on the match between consumer preferences and properties of products.<sup><a href="#N_37_">(37)</a></sup>
A niche embraces not only products in the sense of substances, but also
shapes, colors, textures, tendencies and boundaries, all of which afford
consumers sufficient benefits to sustain a brand. It must be noted that
formally a niche is not simply a (convex or non-convex) combination of
product properties such that the hypervolume would be a matrix of <i>n</i>
vectors describing properties - an assumption underlying the characteristics
approach in consumer theory (Lancaster 1971).
<p>This understanding of the term 'niche' is restricted to the supply side
and is narrower than the term 'market niche' as currently used in marketing
theory. Without loss of any assumption on which brand realism is founded,
the concept can be extended to the demand side. A brand's niche is then
determined by relevant customer characteristics such as demographics, psychographics,
usage patterns and benefits sought, and for every brand core and fringe
customers can be distinguished (Milne 1990; Milne/ Mason 1989; Milne/Mason
1994). To compete, then, brands must target similar customers to a significant
degree. The boundaries of the niche (e.g. their plasticity) and of the
product category will either favor generalist or specialist strategies
(Sudharshan 1995: 34ff.). Competitive advantage, in the realist view, requires
that a brand affords "the best fit between a product's bundle of attributes
and their customers' needs" (MacMillan/McGrath 1996: 58). This match is
understood in a naturalistic rather than a dualistic way, i.e. by assuming
a mutual fittingness of successful branded products and consumer cognition.<sup><a href="#N_38_">(38)</a></sup>
Intensity of competition is then not only "determined by the extent to
which two brands compete for the same customer resources" (Milne 1990:
9) but also by supply-side phenomena such as the number, width, elasticity,
overlap and relative proximity of niches in product space. And competitive
success depends on a particular <i>tuning</i> between products and consumers.
<p>One of the fundamental assumptions about ecological niches has become
known as Gause's competitive exclusion principle, according to which no
two species can coexist permanently in any one niche. It would seem that
this does not fully apply to marketing. In contrast to niches in biological
ecosystems, the niches occupied by competing brands can experience significant
overlap over sustained periods of time, as in the case of Classic Coke
and Pepsi-Cola or that of different brands of compact cars. But overlap
can only cover the fringe of niches while for their core Gause's principle
still holds. Attacks at the core therefore have an all-or-nothing character
- as in the fight between Microsoft and Netscape over the Internet browser
market. But rather than simply resulting from the whims of consumers, who
are mistakenly assumed to be nearly infinitely malleable by advertising,
inter-brand competition is a function of product structure, particularly
of the degrees of similarity among products and the salience of product
features (Ehrenberg/Barnard/Scriven 1997; Chong/Ho/Tang 1998).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>6. IMPLICATIONS</b>
<p>The version of product policy and the understanding of branding defended
here are fully compatible with a subjectivist view of consumer choice.
Subjectivist economics deals, in a formal sense, with how consumers value
products, not with the factors - affordances of products or not - that
permit or elicit such valuation. In a world of complexity, change and uncertainty,
consumers necessarily have imperfect information about the properties and
promises of the multitudes of products. Austrian economics, as the most
consistent school of subjectivist value theory, holds that products are
naturally differentiated. Against Chamberlin's theory of monopolistic competition
it is argued that product differentiation is "a natural aspect of competitive
activity" (Kirzner 1973: 116.). The role which brands play on the market,
like that of commercial goodwill in general, "does not impair or restrict
competition" (Mises 1963: 380). A product, for Austrian economics, is a
variable rather than a datum, its quality and quantity change as a result
of entrepreneurial action. This view may accommodate the fact that which
marketing decisions will turn out to be successful depends on what is afforded
by the nature of the product.
<p>A realist conception of brands does not underrate the role of strategic
management in establishing the success of brands. This role will differ
depending on whether it concerns individual brands or (family or corporate)
umbrella brands, and depending on the degree to which these brands are
defensible. In this conception, marketing theory explains market behavior
in terms of heterogeneity and differentiation rather than similarity and
equilibrium: "Competition is the search for meaningful differential advantage
on the part of both buyers and sellers" (Savitt 1986: 248). Entrepreneurs
do not seek homogeneous market segments but thrive on the opportunities
provided by the heterogeneity of both product space and consumer wants:
"They are trying to develop products that constitute a rupture with what
the competition has to offer" (Dru 1996: 38). Marketing management, as
an entrepreneurial function, aids in the <i>disruption</i> of the market
process. And increasingly this is again founded on features of brands.
<p>Brand realism has equally significant implications for policy issues.
The new understanding permits not only a rethinking of product management
but also a new conception of trademarks and copyrights, of new product
introduction, of the limits of advertising, of price determination, of
the role of brands in accounting, and of marketing strategy in general.
For competition policy it would suggest a new method of determining product
market boundaries and relevant markets, and of measuring product differentiation
and industry concentration in antitrust cases (Milne 1992). Rather than
simply estimating cross-elasticity from panel data, the actual 'mooring'
of brands and their defensibility would be measured, which substitutes
a more realistic and more dynamic approach for one largely based on historical
data about consumer behavior. And brand dilution as understood in the Federal
Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 can be made more precise by investigating
when a "famous mark" enjoys a "distinctive quality", when conditions such
as the "blurring", "tarnishment" or "disparagement" apply and what their
actual impact may be.<sup><a href="#N_39_">(39)</a></sup>
<p>Brand realism proposes an explanation of brand equity that does not
rely on attitudinal assumptions such as brand loyalty. Brand equity is
understood as a real phenomenon to be further explored in an ecological
theory of branding that does not rely on a Cartesian dualism between products
and perceiving minds or between 'products in themselves' and 'products
as objects of marketing management'. Brand equity is a function of the
'closure' of brand elements as 'organic' wholes, of the nature of niches
brands occupy, and of their defensibility. Branding strategies in vertical
and horizontal directions - from sub-branding to brand bridging - can then
be reconstructed in view of the new understanding of products and brands
(Farquhar/ Han/ Herr/Ijiri 1992).
<p>Realism about brands eschews the proliferation of supposedly explanatory
constructs - from brand personality and brand character to brand culture
- that have been introduced in order to explain branding as a consumer-based
phenomenon. If it is a viable project, most of these constructs may fall
under Occam's razor.
<p>Three fields of application may suffice to illustrate the implications
and the relevance of the new conception of brands.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>6.1. Niche Marketing</b>
<p>Niche marketing has come to be understood as the concentration on particular
consumer segments of a small dimension. It has been recommended as a strategy
for small companies, based on the expectation that smaller market share
combined with a lower price elasticity of demand may still afford more
specialized sellers a competitive advantage (Kotler 1997: 251, 395ff.).
The term 'niche marketing' has proliferated, and a veritable myth about
the advantage of small over large market shares and segments has evolved
- culminating in metaphors as those of 'guerrillas' successfully competing
against 'gorillas' (Dalgic 1998).
<p>In the light of a realist conception, the issue is not that of the size
of a target segment, which is usually only measured statically, but that
of the boundaries of the targeted niche. It has been observed that all
product market boundaries are arbitrary - or fiat boundaries - though they
directly affect competitive position measures (Gullinian 1993; Milne/Mason
1994). Market share is a meaningless number unless a company defines the
market in terms of the boundaries separating it from its rivals. These
boundaries are the points of parity at which two brands are equivalent
in a potential customer's judgment, where these points in turn depend on
similarity measures among brands.
<p>A realist view of marketing affords a better understanding of what it
means to 'carve out' a market niche for a brand - a strategy which requires
for its success not only that there is an adequate volume of market demand
but that a niche in product space aligns with it (Milne 1990; Milne/Mason
1989, 1994). And by showing that niches are, depending on whether they
host generalist or specialist brands, independent of market size, it lets
some popular conceptions of niche marketing and micromarketing collapse.
This promises a new understanding of niche marketing and, <i>a fortiori</i>,
of marketing strategy in general.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>6.2. Advertising</b>
<p>In developing his theory of monopolistic competition, Chamberlin argued
that brand names are harmful for economic efficiency, since they rely on
a higher willingness to pay that is exclusively owed to advertising. Other
economists have pointed out that brand names provide consumers valuable
information by signaling cues about quality when product properties cannot
easily be judged in advance of purchase (Erdem/Swait 1998). If brands indeed
are ontologically real, as has been argued, much of this discussion can
be shown to be futile.
<p>The new understanding of brands permits to conceptualize a new role
of market communication, particularly of advertising. The traditional view,
developed in industrial economics, of the relation between advertising
and market power, as expressed by market share, was as follows: advertising
leads to economies of scale (i.e. increasing returns to advertising), which
entail higher concentration ratios, and consequently a higher market power.
A product <i>A</i> was therefore held to be more advertisable than a product
<i>B</i>
if <i>A</i>'s advertising response function is more elastic than
<i>B</i>'s
(Kaldor 1950). If, however, products have a different degree of 'advertisability'
independently of the demand side, as brand realism assumes, and if heavier
advertising produces higher profits even if increased concentration is
not a causal intermediate between advertising and market power, the logic
of this causal chain breaks down. Different degrees of 'advertisability'
may of course simply be reduced to product differentiation (Comanor/Wilson
1967). But numerous studies have invalidated the assumption of increasing
returns to advertising which underlies the 'classical' view of industrial
economics (Simon 1970: ch. 1). Moreover, product differentiation would
appear to be nothing but a 'surface' term for the degree to which products
can occupy niches. 'Advertisability' is then a function of properties of
niches such as niche width and depth, and relates to the defensibility
of brands.
<p>'Classical' industrial economics relies on the assumption that advertising
provides a service different from the product that is being advertised.
It assumes that there are products - whether conceived of as substances
or as bundles of attributes - which, in a separate process, are being brought
to the attention of consumers. As a consequence, Chamberlin assumed a categorical
distinction between production costs and selling costs. But if 'objective'
and 'subjective' product features actually coincide, as brand realism argues,
such a dualism makes no sense: "It is […] clearly improper to treat the
product itself and the advertised 'information' as two complementary ingredients
that might in principle be purchased separately" (Kirzner 1973: 158). If
information about a product is "inseparable from the product itself" (Kirzner
1973: 162), if it is founded on the product, expectations about the power
of advertising will clearly be more modest than was envisaged by mainstream
industrial economics and marketing theory.
<p>The realist model would lend credence to the view that advertising is
a 'weak' and longer-term force nudging consumers to purchase one brand
or another, rather than to the competing and received view that advertising
has a strong and more immediate effect on sales (Uncles/ Ehrenberg/Hammond
1995; Dyson/Farr/Hollis 1996; Farr/Hollis 1997; Ehrenberg/Barnard/ Scriven
1997).<sup><a href="#N_40_">(40)</a></sup> Its primary function is to alert
consumers to available opportunities afforded by brands. Advertising tells
consumers what exactly it is that they do not know about brands, and this
function of eliciting alertness characterizes the entrepreneur (Kirzner
1973: 155ff.). For a product is only "adequately identified" for a consumer
(i.e., the optimal information is provided) if, in his ignorance, "the
supplier has guessed right" (Alderson 1965: 61) - and this cannot be done
by computing marginal rates of substitution but by exercising entrepreneurship
and engaging in exchange. In this sense a new understanding of brands may
shed new light on the opportunities and limits of market communication.<sup><a href="#N_41_">(41)</a></sup>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>6.3. Brand Valuation Measurement</b>
<p>The treatment of intangibles, and particularly of brands, belongs to
the undecided questions of accounting. In accordance with the UK Statement
of Accounting Practice (SSAP 23), Grand Metropolitan Plc, for instance,
has capitalized some of its brands such as Smirnoff, Pillsbury, Green Giant,
and Burger King. Brand value, or brand equity, keeps building up and become
an indispensable factor in the valuation of the firm on a going concern
basis. UK law, as that of most EU countries, permits amortization.
<p>Other countries abide by accounting standards that even require the
amortization of brand values.<sup><a href="#N_42_">(42)</a></sup> This
may be quite an inappropriate policy, since the longevity of brands can
be remarkable and often exceeds even amortization over 50 years. On the
other hand, U.S. accounting standards for intangibles greatly limit what
may be capitalized as a trademark or brand, permitting only purchased trademarks
and successful legal defense to be amortized over five to forty years (Accounting
Principles Board 1970). But it is highly questionable whether only purchased
brands should be placed on balance sheets while omitting internally developed
brands that are blessed with longevity and that continue to be extended
to new product categories. Moreover, the new IRC Sect. 197 postulates a
statutory recovery period for intangible assets of 15 years but does not
cover self-created intangibles such as brands (Young 1994). In the light
of a realist understanding of commercial products the inclusion of customer-based
and supplier-based intangibles and of 'identity rights' (franchise, trademark,
trade name) among amortizable assets and the exclusion of brands, software
or sports franchises from this group must be called in doubt.
<p>Where the accountancy profession or tax law recognize trademarks as
assets while being ambivalent about brands, they are mistaken as to logical
priority. The brand itself is the asset while the trademark provides only
security, or defines an outward boundary of the brand. By taking objective
criteria for the strength of brands as a basis of valuation, brand realism
is apt to provide grounds for a more realistic policy on 'intangibles'
than those currently applied in many countries. By treating brands as a
particular class of tangible products (including 'disembodied' services),
accounting practice no longer has to treat brand equity and goodwill as
basically the same phenomenon but can again conceive of commercial goodwill
as deriving from the totality of firm-specific knowledge about production,
organization and marketing (Tollington 1998).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>7. EXTENSIONS</b>
<p>This paper has made a case for the ontological reality of brands, as
opposed to various forms of brand idealism. The exposition has largely
remained within the realm of material ontology. The formal ontology of
commercial products, like that of marketing and of economics in general,
still needs to be explored. This endeavor will include an analysis of <i>mereological</i>
(i.e. part-whole) and of <i>topological</i> properties of products, brands,
and product categories. It will be presented in an axiomatic form using
the resource of a language such as first-order predicate logic. This will
ensure translatability into the languages (such as Ontolingua) underlying
the various attempts to construct enterprise ontologies within artificial
intelligence frameworks (Guarino 1998; Uschold/King/Moralee/Zorgios 1998).
<p>Mereotopology, however, can only define the architecture of product
space. Investigation of branding as a process, of various branding strategies,
and ultimately of the conditions for influencing brand equity, requires
a second extension and an in-depth study of the ecology of brands. This
will comprise an investigation of at least the following issues: (1) competition
between brands as competition over niche (instead of market) share; (2)
conditions on niche overlap; (3) niche depth and width; (4) maximum and
optimum number of brands in a product category (i.e. carrying capacity
of categories); (5) elasticity of niches with regard to product line and
brand extension; (6) branding strategies such as umbrella branding, sub-branding
etc. Investigation of these issues will have to use tools of mathematical
analysis.
<p>The realist view of brands makes empirical claims about consumer behavior.
In order to establish its validity, testable hypotheses will have to be
developed and confronted with primary and secondary data about brand awareness
and brand choice.

<p><b>Endnotes</b>
<p><a NAME="N_1_"></a>1.<font size=-1> Brands that so dominate a particular
product category that they 'own' that category in the consumer's mind have
been called 'master brands' (Farquhar/Han/Herr/Ijiri 1992).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a><font size=-1>2.&nbsp; It is interesting that the
Enterprise Ontology, an artificial intelligence project within the Ontolingua
framework, is based on a somewhat confused idealist view of brands. In
its marketing section, which is very rudimentary and consists of 22 primitive
terms with 'sale' as the central concept, the relation 'brand-of' is defined
as "a Relationship between a Vendor and a Name (i.e., a text string) whereby
the Name is identifiable by Customers", as "A Name identifiable by Customers
associated with one or more Products of a Vendor", and as "the Name (…)
associated with one or more Products of the Vendor". On the other hand,
an 'image' is "a set of properties that a Customer believes to be true
of a Brand, Product or Vendor", implying that products and brands are at
the same level (<a href="http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~entprise/enterprise/ontology-code/enterprise-v.1.0/Brand-Of.html;">http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~entprise/enterprise/ontology<a NAME="_Hlt437391394"></a></a>-code/enterprise-v.1.0/Brand-Of.html;
Uschold/King/ Moralee/Zorgios 1998).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_3_"></a><font size=-1>3.&nbsp; Examples of an ontological
equivocation are sometimes found in the same publication, e.g. between
"brands in a product class" (Aaker 1996: 11) and "the failure to distinguish
between a product and a brand" (Aaker 1996: 72).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_4_"></a><font size=-1>4.&nbsp; Generics (private-label products
or store brands) claim about 14 per cent of supermarket spending in the
United States, with a tendency towards a larger share (Quelch/Harding 1996;
AC Nielsen 1998: 23ff.). But they are highly concentrated in categories
such as sugar, milk, sour cream, eggs, wrapping materials, bags, vitamins
and ice that are of the nature of commodities and afford little product
differentiation.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_5_"></a><font size=-1>5.&nbsp; Consumers still ranked General
Electric second in the food-blender category 20 years after it had stopped
producing them.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_6_"></a><font size=-1>6.&nbsp; There are producers of cigar
bands and cigar box labels catering to producers of private-label cigars.
However, the significantly lower price these cigars achieve on the market
indicates that a label alone does not constitute a brand.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_7_"></a><font size=-1>7.&nbsp; "It is a widespread fallacy
that skillful advertising can talk the consumers into buying everything
that the advertiser wants them to buy" (Mises 1963: 321).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_8_"></a><font size=-1>8.&nbsp; This issue is subject of a
recent debate in which two positions confront each other: 1. that brand
strength is basically a function of market penetration, which questions
the validity of constructs such as brand equity (Uncles/ Ehrenberg/Hammond
1995; Ehrenberg/Barnard/Scriven 1997); 2. that attitudes toward a brand
and particularly brand loyalty determine success, which makes market share
appear less important (Farr/Hollis 1997).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_9_"></a><font size=-1>9.&nbsp; An example for meaningless
differentiation is a firm's decision to add silk to shampoo and advertising
it with the slogan 'we put silk in a bottle' where silk clearly is irrelevant
for hair (Carpenter/Glazer/Nakamoto 1994).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_10_"></a><font size=-1>10.&nbsp; Thus Calvin Klein could
successfully extend its product line from clothing to perfume and underwear
while Levi's, an equally dominant brand, was unable to extend even from
jeans to dress suits. Johnson &amp; Johnson, deeply positioned as producers
of baby oil and of other toiletries had no success in launching a perfume,
Pierre Cardin's foray into dishware proved to be a failure, and Bic's venture
into pantyhose and perfumes was also not accepted by consumers. On the
other hand, Jell-O successfully extended itself from the dry mix box into
ready-to-eat dessert, yogurt, and ice pops. And the Virgin name could be
extended from a record label to a retail chain of cultural products, electronics
equipment, an airline, a tour operator, a multimedia production company,
and even to condoms. But the Virgin Cola brand is currently less successful
in the U.S. soft drinks market.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_11_"></a><font size=-1>11.&nbsp; In <i>Federal Trade Commission
v. Borden Co.(1966)</i> the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FTC's view "that
labels do not differentiate products for the purpose of determining grade
or quality". Not consumer preferences or brand acceptability determine
the grade of evaporated milk but rather "characteristics of the product
itself" (383 U.S. 637, 86 S.Ct. 1092, 16 L. Ed. 2d 153).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_12_"></a><font size=-1>12. "The emergent theory asserts that
there are certain wholes, composed (say) of constituents A, B, and C in
a relation R to each other; that all wholes composed of constituents of
the same kind as A, B, and C in relations of the same kind as R have certain
characteristic properties; that A, B, and C are capable of occurring in
other kinds of complex where the relation is not of the same kind as R;
and that the characteristic properties of the whole R (A, B, C) cannot,
even in theory, be deduced from the most complete knowledge of the properties
of A, B, and C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the form
R (A, B, C)" (Broad 1925: 61).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_13_"></a><font size=-1>13. This implies that brands are to
be understood rather in the sense of the Berlin than in that of the Graz
or Vienna schools of Gestalt theory (see Smith 1988).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_14_"></a><font size=-1>14. Most brand leaders of 70 years
ago - including Kodak, Wrigley, Coca Cola, Morton and Campbell - are still
brand leaders today (Kotler 1997: 445).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_15_"></a><font size=-1>15. The European Union, for example,
has already recognized more than 400 Protected Designations of Origin (PDO)
and Protected Geographical Designations (PGD) under regulations EEC 2081/92
and 2082/92, mostly for agro-food products including cheeses, wines, oils
and fresh meats. The GATT Uruguay Round documents include an Agreement
on Rules of Origin which also affords protection for products claiming
the status of country-of-origin brands.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_16_"></a><font size=-1>16. This was the case when, on April
2, 1993, the price of Marlboro cigarettes was lowered by 40 cents a pack,
thus changing in consumers' minds the clear position of one of the strongest
brands. As a result of 'Marlboro Friday', the stock of Philip Morris, Inc.
dropped $14.75 per share, or 23 per cent of its value, wiping out $13 billion
in market value. In the next few months, 25 of the top brand marketers
in the United States including Sara Lee, Procter &amp; Gamble, Heinz and
Gillette saw their market value plunge by a combined $45 billion (Keller
1998: 61f.).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_17_"></a><font size=-1>17. "<i>Rxy</i> is a grounded relation
if and only if it is logically impossible for there to exist a <i>z</i>
and a <i>w</i> with exactly the same qualities as <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
respectively, but between which the relation <i>R</i> does not hold" (Johansson
1989: 120).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_18_"></a><font size=-1>18. Crest has certain features that
other brands of toothpaste do not have, be these features red stripes,
a particular taste, a greater viscosity, or a more appealing packaging.
These afford the construction of a brand identity, which since 1958 has
been encapsulated in variants of the tagline 'no cavities'. This identity
has emerged from product space, has been reinforced through advertising,
and has thus become an integral (and maybe constitutive) property of the
brand.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a><font size=-1>19. This is witnessed by the difficulties
Virgin Cola currently has in the United States in establishing a share
of even less than one per cent of the soft drinks market, in spite of an
expected image spillover of the Virgin name and sizeable marketing expenditure.
The price premium of the 'national' brands Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola averages
about 40 per cent.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_20_"></a><font size=-1>20. Source: <i>Beverage Digest</i>
2/12/1998. The average price premium of Classic Coke over Pepsi-Cola, however,
amounted only to $ 0.04. Figures for 1997.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_21_"></a><font size=-1>21. An exception would be products
that, because of their production in a particular region, fulfill both
necessary and sufficient conditions for being branded. Thus an objective
feature differentiates Roquefort cheese, Bordeaux wine, or (Kentucky) bourbon
from which differences in taste, aroma, appearance etc. derive. According
to the French system of '<i>appelations</i>', or registered and protected
growing areas, soil ('<i>terroir</i>') suffices as a measure of the relative
quality of wine (Thode/Maskulka 1998).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_22_"></a><font size=-1>22. Similarly, physical space affords
multiple use, and particular arrangements of furniture and appliances in
kitchens, offices, or at supermarket checkout counters can facilitate or
impede efficient workflow and affect possible psychological states of occupants
(Kirsh 1995).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_23_"></a><font size=-1>23. Ecological naturalism emphasizes
the non-separation between the mind and the medium in which it evolves,
their biological co-determination, and the supra-individual nature of the
biology of mental phenomena. By implication, it is non-Cartesian and does
not treat the domains of physical and mental phenomena differently. Ecological
naturalism does not entail objectivism or essentialism if these are understood
to be the views that reality has all its properties independently of any
perceptual or cognitive interaction with it, and that all reality is characterized
by essential properties (N&uacute;&ntilde;ez 1995).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_24_"></a><font size=-1>24. Salt also is a commodity that
seems to permit little product differentiation. Nonetheless Morton's salt
is estimated to have a share of about 50 per cent of the American market.
This has been achieved by introducing a higher degree of product differentiation,
e.g., by creating the Morton Lite Salt<sup>&reg;</sup>, Morton<sup>&reg;</sup>
Kosher Salt, Morton<sup>&reg;</sup> Salt Substitute, Morton<sup>&reg;</sup>
Popcorn Salt, and Morton<sup>&reg;</sup> Canning and Pickling Salt brands
and by accepting a low price difference in comparison with private label
salt. The success of Morton's salt thus seems to corroborate a realist
view of brands.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_25_"></a><font size=-1>25.&nbsp; Franz Brentano demarcated
mental from physical entities by reference to two criteria: the directedness
of mental acts towards their objects and the intentional inexistence of
objects in mental acts (Grassl 1982). His claim is that mental phenomena
are distinguished by having content that is intrinsic to their identity.
It seems that Searle tries to separate these two criteria again by embracing
directedness but not intentional inexistence.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_26_"></a><font size=-1>26. The Nunes Company, Inc., has successfully
branded a range of agricultural commodities such as lettuce, celery and
broccoli under the trademark Foxy<sup>&reg;</sup>, the Jamaican company
Jamaica Broilers Group Ltd. has established a poultry brand under the name
Best Dressed Chicken<sup>&reg;</sup>.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_27_"></a><font size=-1>27. In contradistinction to the received
conception as 'immaterial goods', services have been defined as "deeds,
processes, and performances" (Zeihaml/Bitner 1996: 5). Services, in fact,
fall into two groups - embodied and disembodied (or splintered) services
- depending on whether they require a physical carrier medium or not (Bhagwati
1984). Some services such as haircuts or dental surgery can only be personally
delivered and require the spatial and temporal presence of both producer
and consumer. Other services, such as a painting, the performance of a
symphony, or photography consist of the unique creative act and require
a physical carrier medium such as canvas, a CD or film to be preserved.
If services are relations in the Aristotelian sense, they must rather be
regarded as relational accidents that have temporal parts (Smith 1997,
1999).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_28_"></a><font size=-1>28. European marketing scholars seem
to place more emphasis on the 'wholeness' or 'integrity' of successful
brands than Anglo-American scholars do (e.g., Becker 1993: 173f.).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_29_"></a><font size=-1>29.&nbsp; This includes the case of
aggregates of commodities. Hicks argued out that if a group of prices move
in parallel, then the corresponding commodities may be treated as a single
good.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_30_"></a><font size=-1>30.&nbsp; Geometric representation
of competitive patterns between brands, for example through perceptual
mapping, project brands as points in a low-dimensional coordinate space
so that the degree of observed competitiveness between properties is represented
by Euclidean distance measures. Compositional approaches typically reduce
multidimensional brand characteristics as perceived by consumers into lower-dimensional
spaces and employ data reduction methods such as discriminant analysis.
Decompositional approaches are usually based on multidimensional scaling
techniques and require proximity or dominance data as observed by respondents'
similarity or preference statements concerning competing brands (Wedel/Kamamura
1997).</font>

in the economic literature that any attempt at constructing an exclusively
demand-based consumer theory is flawed. The demand for attributes in various
combinations is determined by consumer preferences, but the supply of these
attributes depends on the costs of producing them and on producers' access
to product markets. A large coefficient for a particular attribute in a
hedonic price function may therefore reflect not only consumer evaluations
of that attribute but also the difficulty of producing this attribute given
scarce input factors (Rosen 1974).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_32_"></a><font size=-1>32. The boundaries of services merit
further differentiation. Disembodied (or 'splintered') services such as
symphonies on a CD may be said to be bounded by the surfaces of the carrier
medium while embodied (or personal) services such as haircuts are bounded
in space by their hosts (i.e. the persons, animals, objects etc. receiving
these services) and by time.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_33_"></a><font size=-1>33.&nbsp; Courts have repeatedly applied
Gestalt principles in matters of trademark protection, copyright and advertising,
particularly in deciding on the respective claims of competing brands (Zaichkowsky
1995: 74ff.).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_34_"></a><font size=-1>34.&nbsp; Such wholes, which embrace
within themselves objects from distinct ontological categories, describe
the nature of many services such as education or operas. They have been
referred to as 'transcategorial wholes' (Smith 1999b).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_35_"></a><font size=-1>35.&nbsp; There have been a few attempts
to construct a theory of marketing on the basis of a time-space framework.
Rather than consumers and firms simply being represented by utility or
cost functions, they take up unique spatiotemporal regions and act within
both perceived (i.e. fiat) and real (i.e. bona fide) boundaries (Savitt
1986). This realist approach certainly deserves to be developed further.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_36_"></a><font size=-1>36.&nbsp; In <i>Brown Shoe Co. v.
United States (1962)</i> the U.S. Supreme Court held that "the outer boundaries
of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability
of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and
substitutes for it". The boundaries of submarkets, however, "may be determined
by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of
the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics
and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices,
sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors" (370 U.S. 294, 82
S.Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510). In addition to market characteristics, product
properties, too, were recognized as constituting fiat boundaries, the term
'submarket' coinciding with what has here been called 'product category'.
In<i> United Brands Company and United Brands Continentaal B.V. v. Commission
of the European Communities</i>, the Court of Justice of the European Communities
decided that bananas constitute a market which is independent of the fresh
fruit market on account of the special physical, functional and economic
characteristics of bananas. The Court refers to properties such as taste,
softness, hygienic handling, seedlessness and nutritional value, which
reduce the interchangeability of bananas with other fruit and afford consumption
by "all consumers and especially certain categories of consumers" (No.
27/76, February 14, 1978).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_37_"></a><font size=-1>37.&nbsp; The literature that applies
the niche concept to various marketing issues (Milne/Mason 1989; Milne/Mason
1994) has overlooked that brands do not resemble species as currently understood
in the philosophy of biology. For example, degree of morphological difference
is assumed not to be a sufficient criterion for a species. Moreover, the
term 'species' is used both in a typological sense (i.e. as belonging to
the metalanguage of biology) and as referring to actual taxa whereas brands,
in a realist view, are only the latter, i.e. instance of the object domain
(Mayr 1996).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_38_"></a><font size=-1>38.&nbsp; A further development of
brand realism may draw upon insights gained by Roger Barker's theory of
physical-behavioral units and environmental settings (Smith 1999b).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_39_"></a><font size=-1>39.&nbsp; Section 43(c)(15 USC &sect;
1125 c).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_40_"></a><font size=-1>40.&nbsp; This does not necessarily
imply concurrence with the view that the behavior of consumers toward brands
is sufficiently well described by a stochastic model of the Dirichlet type
that makes the extra conceptual baggage associated with brand equity redundant
(Uncles/Ehrenberg/Hammond 1995; Ehrenberg/Barnard/Scriven 1997).</font>
<p><a NAME="N_41_"></a><font size=-1>41. Since niches cannot be created
<i>ad
libitum</i>, talk about consumers being misled as to their 'true' needs
by the 'commodity fetishism' inherent in marketing would appear to be idle
rhetoric.</font>
<p><a NAME="N_42_"></a><font size=-1>42.&nbsp; In this context it is regrettable
that in October 1998 the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)
issued IAS 38, which specifically prohibits the recognition as assets of
internally generated goodwill, brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer
lists and items similar in substance. This is a retrograde step by comparison
with those countries which already permit capitalization of brand value
as assets on balance sheets.</font></blockquote>
