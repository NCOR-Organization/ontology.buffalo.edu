  <p> Ontologists are needed by private industry and by governments, non-profit
     organizations and other institutions to develop and manage large databases&nbsp;
     and directories, to model and analyze complex structures and processes,
   and  to build systems for data and enterprise integration. Students interested&nbsp;
     in this fast-growing field who wish to acquire a background in the theory
     and practice of ontology may apply for the MA in Philosophy with specialization
     in <font color="#ffffff"><b>ONTOLOGY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE</b>.</font>
         This interdisciplinary program, offered by the Department of Philosophy
    of &nbsp; the University at Buffalo, allows students to work with relevant
    faculty in Computer Science and Engineering, Geography, Informatics, Linguistics, and the Life Sciences. We aim to train professionals who
will understand    the work that ontologists do and will have the ability
to apply ontological    theories to a broad range of problems. Graduates of 
	Buffalo ontology programs have excellent placement opportunities in both 
	government and industry.</p>

    with ontologists throughout the world, including the <a href="http://suo.ieee.org/refs.html">
           IEEE</a>
  Standard Upper Ontology Project and the GOL (General Ontological&nbsp;

           THE UNIVERSITY</font></b><br>
       <br>
    The University at Buffalo, with roughly 23,500 graduate and undergraduate&nbsp; 
 students, is the largest institution of higher learning of the State University&nbsp; 
 of New York system. It is a graduate center and a major U.S. public university&nbsp; 
 located on the US-Canada border near <a href="http://ontology.buffalo.edu/map.gif">Niagara Falls</a>. As the only public member in New York and New England of the prestigious
  Association of American Universities, the University at Buffalo stands
in&nbsp;  the first rank among the nation&#8217;s research-intensive public universities.
  Interactions among the university&#8217;s professional schools and its arts 
and sciences faculties, especially in cross-disciplinary research centers,
 give graduate and professional education at the University at Buffalo a
particular  richness and depth.<p>The University is home to the
	<a href="http://ncor.us">National Center for Ontological Research</a> and 
	the <a href="http://org.buffalo.edu">Ontology Research Group</a>, and is one 
	of three US participating institutions of the
	<a href="http://bioontology.org">National Center for Biomedical Ontology</a>.</p>

       <br>
             Students may apply for the MA either with a BA in Philosophy 
or  with   a  major&nbsp; in one of the above fields and with some undergraduate
  experience    in&nbsp; Philosophy.&nbsp; GRE scores, transcripts and two
 letters of recommendation    &nbsp; are required&nbsp; for admission. For
 students applying from abroad    the GRE requirement may in exceptional
circumstances   be waived. As part  of  your application materials, please
include an official&nbsp;   transcript    from  all of the universities you
have attended and your scores   on the GRE   test. Foreign students must
also report their TOEFL scores.  Applications   are accepted for both August
and January for admissions. Requests  for applications&nbsp;    to the M.A.
in Ontology and Information Science  can be made to either the    postal
address or the e-mail address listed below. Applications may also   be made
electronically. <i>Applications are accepted for both August and  January
admission. Since we currently offer rolling admission, there are no specific

              TUITION AND FINANCIAL AID<br>
       <br>
       </font></b>Tuition rates at the University at Buffalo are highly 
competitive      -- one-third&nbsp; to one-quarter the cost of attending
some  other institutions.      For example,&nbsp; the 1998/­99 academic-year
tuition for full-time    students  who are residents&nbsp; of New York State
was $5,100; $8,416 for   nonresidents.  A limited number of partial tuition
scholarships are available   for exceptional  first-year students. We also
encourage you to contact the     <a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/services/fin-aid/">
    Office of Financial   Aid</a>
  to inquire about other sources of financial  aid that may help defray 
 the cost of attendance. <br>
